Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,1,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Profile:  Ms. Charlotte Greene  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presents today with complaints of severe chest pain radiating down the left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath.  Demographics:  Native of Pennsylvania  USA  she is retired  widowed  and lives alone. Her income is modest  primarily from her pension and Social Security. She has a high-school education and was previously employed as a school clerk. She has strong social support from her daughter and neighbors.   Medical History:  Ms. Greene has a 20-year history of hypertension that has been fairly controlled with medication (lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg daily). She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years prior  managed with metformin and a balanced diet.  Six months ago  Ms. Greene lost her husband unexpectedly. She has been under significant emotional stress since then and has been in counseling for grief processing. She has struggled with transient periods of depression but was neither formally diagnosed nor medicated for it. She denies any history of smoking  drug abuse  or excessive alcohol use. Her BMI falls within normal range  pointing to satisfactory nutritional status.  She has no known allergies and is currently off her routine medications.   Recent Event:  Yesterday  after hearing some bad news concerning a close friend  she experienced severe chest pains resembling a myocardial infarction. However  upon visiting the local emergency room  she had normal coronary arteries on catheterization  but her left ventricular function showed a pattern consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Concluding Remarks  The patient's demographic details including age  gender  and the stressor event fit the typical profile of a patient diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. In this case  the cardiomyopathy is likely a physiological manifestation of the chronic emotional stress Ms. Greene has been experiencing. She needs supportive therapy  psychological counselling along with regular cardiological follow-ups.   The non-cardiac chest pain in takotsubo cardiomyopathy could easily lead to misdiagnosis  hence the presence of any potential emotional or physical triggers should be sought to enable prompt and accurate assessment.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,2,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   The patient presented today is a 69 year-old Caucasian female who has been recently widowed. She reports a sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath following her husband's funeral. She sought medical attention suspecting a heart attack due to her symptoms correlating with common signs of myocardial infarction (MI)  coupled with her family history of heart disease.   In terms of her past medical history  she was diagnosed with hypertension 13 years ago and has been taking anti-hypertensive medication regularly. Furthermore  she has managed type II diabetes with oral hypoglycemics for the past 7 years. She has no history of tobacco  alcohol or illicit substance use.   Upon examination  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly known as 'broken heart syndrome'. Her EKG displayed ST-segment elevation and lab tests showed slight increase in cardiac enzymes  but without the expected correlation seen in typical MIs. The conclusive diagnosis was made upon echocardiogram revealing apical ballooning and dysfunction of the left ventricle which are indicative of this condition.  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a condition predominantly found among postmenopausal women and it is often triggered by severe stress. In this case  the death of her husband likely served as a triggering event. Despite the scary symptomatology mimicking a heart attack  prognosis is generally good with most patients recovering within weeks under proper care. Timely diagnosis and attentive supportive care are crucial for patient recovery.   In this instance  managing the patient's diabetes and hypertension  and recommending grief counseling or stress management techniques should be incorporated in a comprehensive treatment approach. Although the patient's immediate prognosis is promising  her chronic conditions and emotional trauma must be addressed to avoid potential recurrence and ensure overall health.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,3,Title: Case Presentation - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Demographics: Female Patient  Age: 69  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Nurse  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. J  a widow who lives alone  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath following a heated argument with a neighbor.  Past Medical History: Mrs. J has a medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia which are well-controlled with medication. She underwent hysterectomy in her early 50s and is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption. She has no known allergies. Her family history reveals her father had a heart attack in his 70s.  Physical Examination: Mrs. J appeared anxious. Initial vital signs revealed blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 94% in room air. On auscultation  heart sounds were normal with no added sounds; lungs were clear.  Investigations: Electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevation in anterior leads. Acute coronary syndrome was suspected. However  angiography revealed no significant stenosis to explain her chest pain. Only apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesis of the left ventricle was noted  leading us towards the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Hospital Course: Mrs. J was admitted to the cardiac care unit for management of acute takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She was given beta blockers and ACE inhibitors as heart failure treatment and was monitored closely.   This case represents a typical demographic diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition predominantly seen in postmenopausal women  often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. The patient's presentation was initially misleading towards acute myocardial infarction  however  the hallmark feature of apical ballooning of the left ventricle found in angiogram strongly indicated Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The patient responded well to the treatment and is now under regular follow-ups.  
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,4,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Introduction:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCC)  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a reversible condition often triggered by stressful events that result in the weakening of the left ventricle  the heart's main pumping chamber. This temporary condition is most common in post-menopausal women between 58 and 75 years old.  Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female  who was brought into the emergency department reporting severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient stated that her symptoms began suddenly  following a significant emotional stress event - the sudden death of her husband.  Demographics and Past Medical History:  The patient lives in urban middle-class neighborhood with her adult children. She has retired from a long-standing career as a school teacher. She is a nonsmoker  consumes alcohol moderately and has no known drug allergies. The patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is compliant with her prescribed medications  amlodipine and simvastatin. There is no family history of congenital heart diseases. Last mammogram and colonoscopy screening were normal and performed 14 months ago.  The patient’s weight and BMI are within normal range and recently completed annual physical examination was essentially unremarkable. She mentioned having been through menopause at age 51 and has been on hormone replacement therapy since then.  Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosis:  She displays typical signs and symptoms of a heart attack  including severe chest pain and breathlessness. Her EKG shows ST-elevation  but her coronary angiogram reveals no significant blockages in multiple coronary arteries  hence ruling out a conventional heart attack. These observations  as well as the absence of other potential diseases  and the quick recovery of the ventricular function point to a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomypathy. The patient also has slightly elevated levels of stress hormones  supporting the TCC diagnosis.   Summary:  This representation is typical of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy patients in literature: a postmenopausal woman experiencing a significant stressful event. The prognosis for the patient looks favorable with the appropriate supportive care and removal from the stressed environment. It is important  however  to closely monitor her heart function in the immediate future due to her pre-existing hypertension  even after her symptoms have resolved.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,5,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female of non-Hispanic descent  hailing from Wisconsin  USA. She has baseline normal body mass index (BMI) and holds a history of non-smoking. She is a widow  living alone  suggesting a level of psychological stress. She is known to lead a sedentary lifestyle and boasts relatively minimal (occasional glass of wine) alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: Our patient has a noteworthy medical history of hypertension  which is controlled by Lisinopril and a well-managed case of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  where her glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) has consistently been 7% or less. Her last HbA1c  three months ago was 6.8%. She has high cholesterol levels for which she takes Atorvastatin. She suffers from periodic episodes of anxiety  for which she is on low-dose SSRIs. She recently endured the loss of her spouse  an event that has heightened her psychological stress.  Presenting Concern: She presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain  mimicking the pain associated with a myocardial infarction (MI)  accompanied with shortness of breath. This began suddenly after receiving news about the death of a close friend. On examination  she appeared visibly distressed and in pain.   Current Diagnosis: Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-elevation  and her troponin levels were mildly elevated. However  subsequent angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease  making myocardial infarction unlikely. Given the context  her symptoms  ECG changes  and minimal elevation of cardiac enzymes  provisional diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome) was made. This was confirmed by finding the characteristic apical ‘ballooning’ on echocardiography.   The patient’s condition aligns with the demographic representation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  which is most common among postmenopausal women and often triggered by intense physical or emotional stress. The prognosis for our patient is generally good with supportive treatment and addressing stress management. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,6,"Title: Presentation of Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Scenario: Female patient  Age 72  Demographics: Patient is named Mrs. Anita  a 72-year-old Caucasian female. She is a retired school teacher living with her 75-year-old husband in a suburban area. Her only child lives overseas but keeps regular contact. She is socially active and participates in community activities. She has a homecare assistant to help her with daily chores.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Anita has a history of hypertension for the past 20 years and is taking medications for the same. Last year  she was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes and is managing it with lifestyle changes and oral hypoglycemic agents. She also has osteoarthritis for which she takes occasional pain killers. She quit smoking about 25 years ago and claims to have no alcohol intake. She has no family history of heart diseases.  Presenting Complaint: Recently  following the death of one of her friends  Mrs. Anita experienced intense chest pain and was rushed to the emergency room. She mentioned being under a lot of stress due to the sudden loss but didn't have shortness of breath or fainting episodes. She had her hypertension under control and had no previous episodes of chest pain. The EKG indicated changes mimicking myocardial infarction; however  coronary angiography showed no signs of significant blockage. After further diagnostic tests  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Literature Context: According to medical literature  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" predominantly affects postmenopausal women and is often triggered by intense physical or emotional stress. It mimics myocardial infarction  but unlike it  coronary angiography typically shows no obstructive coronary artery disease. Its management involves treating the presenting symptoms and controlling risk factors. Long-term prognosis is usually good with appropriate management.  Reference: Ghadri  J. R.  Wittstein  I. S.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,8,"Presentation:  Good afternoon everyone  today I would like to present a patient with a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""".  The patient is a 67-year-old female of Caucasian ethnicity. Literature shows us that this syndrome primarily targets postmenopausal women with an average age between 58-75 years  a demographic our patient fits into precisely.  Now  heading to her medical history. She hasn't been previously diagnosed with heart disease  and she has an unremarkable cardiac history in her family. This is consistent with the current literature which suggests that takotsubo cardiomyopathy isn't typically associated with a previously known coronary artery disease.   The patient does  however  have a history of generalized anxiety disorder and has been on anti-anxiety medication for many years. This is notable considering strong ties between takotsubo cardiomyopathy and emotional or physical stress.   She was rushed to our hospital earlier this week following an incident of severe emotional stress that occurred soon after the death of her husband. She experienced sudden  intense chest pain along with shortness of breath  symptoms that mimic those of a heart attack  which are typical presentations of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Currently  the exact cause of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is unclear; however  a surge of stress hormones  such as adrenaline  seems to cause damage to the heart muscle in individuals with this syndrome  possibly explaining our patient's condition.  The patient is stable now and under close observation. Our immediate management approach includes relieving her stress  symptom management  and initiating supportive therapy with close monitoring of cardiac function.  This case is a reminder of the significant interplay between our psychological and physical states. It also highlights the importance of recognizing variations in the presentation of heart diseases. Addressing these necessitates a comprehensive and empathetic approach to our patient care."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,9,Patient Presentation:  We are presented with a 70-year-old Caucasian woman who has been rushed to the emergency department presenting severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She is single and has lived alone since her husband passed away a few years ago. Prior to the pain  she reported experiencing considerable emotional stress due to the sudden death of a close friend she considered part of her family.  On examination  she is in noticeable distress and the quasi-diagonal line of Louis is not clearly visible. Her blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg  heart rate 110 bpm  and oxygen saturation 92%.  The patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of general anxiety disorder and mild hypertension which is currently being controlled with a diuretic  hydrochlorothiazide. She has no known history of coronary artery disease  myocardial infarction  or other significant cardiac conditions. There is no recorded drug abuse  tobacco use  or alcohol abuse. She does not have any family history of sudden cardiac death  or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.   Given her presentation and background  an initial hypothesis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy – also known as 'broken heart syndrome' – is considered. This condition primarily affects postmenopausal women and significant emotional stress  like the patient's recent bereavement  is often a primary trigger. This case underscores the importance of investigating the possible psychological contributors to physical ailments  especially in this demographic group. Prompt confirmation and appropriate intervention for this reversible cause of cardiac dysfunction is crucial to improve the prognosis for these patients.    Further diagnosis must be confirmed with appropriate tests such as an EKG  echocardiogram  or heart catheterization  considering the chance of coronary artery disease or other conditions that may present with similar symptoms. The treatment plan will be personalized and may include heart medications  diuretics  and possibly a type of therapy or medication for stress and anxiety. The patient will also be followed up for therapeutic efficacy  side effects  and management of her hypertension and anxiety disorders.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,10,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Profile: Our patient today is a 69-year-old Caucasian female who lives in an urban setting. She is retired  and recently widowed which subjected her to significant psychological stress. She is moderately active  a non-smoker  and consumes alcohol socially. Her BMI falls within the normal range.   Past Medical History: Her past medical history reveals that she is relatively healthy  with no incidence of diabetes mellitus or thyroid disease. However  she has been under treatment for hypertension over the past ten years and has a family history of cardiovascular disease. She also has intermittent anxiety issues over the years but has never been on medication for it.   Presenting Symptoms: Patient presents with severe chest pain and shortness of breath these past two days  symptoms which are typically associated with acute coronary syndrome. She reported that her symptoms started shortly after hearing the devastating news about the loss of a close family member. There were no accompanying symptoms like nausea  vomiting  or palpitations. Upon reviewing symptoms  there is suspicion of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  the heart disease often called “broken heart syndrome”.  Key Background Information: Studies indicate that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is more prevalent in postmenopausal women  which aligns with our patient's profile. Along with her age and the recent stressful event  this further suggests the possibility of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Generally  these patients do not have a history of preexisting psychiatric illness or much other comorbidity. Our patient's history of hypertension is a risk factor seen in many Takotsubo patients.  In conclusion  our patient's demographic profile  past medical history  presenting symptoms  and a precipitating event of emotional distress makes Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy a considerable diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,11,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Case Profile: Patient's Name: Mrs. X Age: 68 years old Sex: Female  Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. X presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset severe chest pain after hearing about the sudden death of her beloved pet. The pain was constricting in nature  with no radiation or relieving factors.  Past Medical History: Mrs. X suffers from hypertension well-controlled with medication. She also has osteoarthritis in her joints  mainly in her knees and hands. She maintains a balanced diet and completes regular low-impact exercise. She has no history of smoking or alcohol consumption.  Clinical Presentation: On the day of the presentation  Mrs. X experienced emotional distress. She described the chest pain as 'like a heavy weight'  with concomitant symptoms of shortness of breath  nausea  and diaphoresis – all suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. On physical examination  she appeared pale and was sweating. Her blood pressure was 160/98 mmHg  which is high for her  and her heart rate was 88 beats/minute. An initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads.   Investigations and Diagnosis: Based on the initial tests  the patient was suspected of having an acute myocardial infarction. She immediately underwent coronary angiography  which surprisingly showed no significant coronary artery disease. An echocardiogram  however  indicated left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical ballooning and contraction base. These features  in combination with the acute emotional stress  confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as 'broken heart syndrome').   In summary  Mrs. X is a 68-year-old female with well-controlled hypertension  presented with symptoms mimicking an acute myocardial infarction after exposure to emotional stress. Investigations confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient will engage in further testing  treatment  and follow-up for this condition.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,12,"Patient Presentation  Name: Mrs. Jennifer Thompson Age: 68 Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired School Teacher   Mrs. Thompson presented at the clinic with acute chest pain  diaphoresis  and shortness of breath that started approximately an hour ago. She has a history of hypertension  which is managed with medication  and a 10-year history of generalized anxiety disorder treated with SSRNs. Mrs. Thompson had recently lost her husband  and she expressed that this was a significant emotional stressor. She denies any smoking history  regular alcohol  or any illicit drug use.   On presentation  her blood pressure was elevated at 165/90  and her heart rate was tachycardic at 110 bpm. An EKG showed ST-segment elevation suggestive of myocardial infarction. Yet  cardiac biomarker levels  such as troponin  were within the normal range.  Her physical exam was only notable for diaphoresis and anxiety. Her chest examination was within normal limits - clear and equal bilateral breath sounds with no peripheral edema. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular rhythm without any murmurs or added sounds. Abdominal and neurological examination was also unremarkable.  She was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""" following cardiac catheterization which showed apical ballooning but no obstructive coronary disease. The patient was managed with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and her anxiety disorder was better controlled.   This presentation aligns with the typical demographic profile of a Takotsubo cardiomyopathy patient: post-menopausal women  around the age of 60-75  often experiencing a recent severe emotional stressor. Mrs. Thompson's hypertensive status would also be a risk factor. Please note  while the pathogenesis is not fully understood  the condition is often preceded by severe emotional stress and has a strong association with neurologic or psychiatric disorders."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,13,Title: A Case Presentation on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics: Patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian female  widowed  retired primary school teacher  currently residing with her eldest daughter. She has no history of alcohol or substance abuse. She is a never-smoker with a Body Mass Index of 24.5.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  which have been well-managed on medications (Lisinopril 10mg daily and Atorvastatin 20mg daily) for the past 13 years. She also has a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder which is primarily managed through psychotherapy and occasional use of Alprazolam. The patient has no history of allergies  and her immunization status is up-to-date. There is a familial history of cardiovascular disease (CVD)  her father passed away at age 74 due to myocardial infarction.   Presenting Complaint: The patient was brought to the emergency room with acute onset of severe chest pain and shortness-of-breath following a sudden emotional distress (death of a close friend). The pain was described as a heavy crushing sensation  radiating to her left arm  and was associated with feelings of apprehension and lightheadedness.  Clinical Assessment and Working Diagnosis: Initial investigations including ECG showed ST-elevation in precordial leads and elevated cardiac troponin levels. These findings are suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome; however  the absence of obstructive coronary disease on angiography and presence of apical ballooning on echocardiography in the context of preceding emotional stress  lead to the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or 'broken-heart syndrome'.  Comment: The demographic details and diagnosis align with common characteristics of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as described in literature  which predominantly affects post-menopausal women  often triggered by physical or emotional stress. Furthermore  anxiety has been proposed as a potential risk factor for stress induced cardiomyopathy in several reports  highlighting the possible underlying mechanism of the disease in this patient.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,14,Slide 1: Introduction  Title: Case Presentation: 70-year-old female with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  Slide 2: Patient Profile  Meet Mrs. A  a 70-year-old Caucasian woman from suburban New England. She is a widowed retiree who still remains socially active in certain clubs and organizations in her community.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mrs. A has a past medical history notable for well-controlled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and history of major depressive disorder. She has been on Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and statins  as well as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for her conditions. She does not have diabetes  does not smoke  and does not report any excessive alcohol use.  Slide 4: Current Symptoms  Mrs. A consulted her cardiologist after experiencing an episode of severe chest pain following the death of a close friend. It mimicked severe angina and was associated with extreme stress and emotional strain.   Slide 5: Diagnosis  Upon evaluation  the patient recorded elevated cardiac enzyme levels. ECG showed ST-elevation  simulating myocardial infarction. However  upon coronary angiography  no significant coronary stenosis was observed. Left ventriculography highlighted an unexpected ‘apical ballooning’ and reduced ejection fraction characteristic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Demographic Relevance  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as ‘Broken heart syndrome’  predominantly targets postmenopausal women  aged 58-75 - a demographic that Mrs. A falls into. It is frequently associated with acute emotional or physiological stress and often mimics acute coronary syndrome. This form of cardiomyopathy sees a higher prevalence in those with a history of neurological or psychiatric illness  and our patient has a history of major depressive disorder.  Slide 7: Conclusion  A comprehensive approach to managing patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  like Mrs. A  is crucial. This must encompass not just the medical but also the emotional elements. Given that stress identification is central to its development and prevention  effective strategies such as stress management and mental health support are vital aspects of the treatment.   Slide 8: Further Management  Further management aims to control underlying cardiovascular risk factors  her mood disorder  and prevent any future acute episodes. She would require close surveillance and follow-up to monitor her cardiac functions and overall health.   Slide 9: Patient Outcomes  Proper management leads to promising outcomes with many patients experiencing complete recovery of left ventricular function at six months. However  the risk of recurrence remains  thus necessitating efficient long-term care.   Slide 10: Case Wrap-up  We shared Mrs. A’s case with you today as it highlights the important consideration of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in females presenting with chest pain and emotional stress. It reminds us also of the value of comprehensive medical approach to yield the best patient outcomes.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,15,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Profile: The patient is Mrs. Jane Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  residing in a suburban neighborhood in California. She is a retired nurse and a widower with two adult children. Mrs. Smith has been experiencing increasing levels of stress and anxiety related to recently losing her husband and being at home alone during the pandemic. She presents today with chief complaints of sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. She has no prior medical history of cardiac disease.  Demographic Information: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  colloquially known as 'broken heart syndrome ' predominantly affects post-menopausal women  particularly among those aged 67-77 years. Studies indicate that this condition is observed more in women than men  with a 9:1 occurrence ratio  which aligns with Mrs. Smith's demographic profile. Moreover  it is reported more frequently among Caucasians and Asians.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Smith has been previously diagnosed with hypertension  controlled with medication for the past ten years. She also has a history of type II diabetes diagnosed 6 years ago  currently controlled with diet and oral hypoglycemics. Mrs. Smith denies any history of smoking  alcohol  or illicit drug use. She has been attending regular mammograms and pap tests  with no abnormal findings. Her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease with her father succumbing to a myocardial infarction in his seventies.  Current Presentation: Mrs. Smith presents with severe chest pain and dyspnea  features suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. However  she has no history of angina or evidence suggestive of coronary artery disease. A detailed examination does not reveal any signs of cardiogenic shock or pulmonary embolism. However  EKG findings exhibit signs suggestive of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Further tests like echocardiography and coronary angiography are conducted to rule out other possible conditions and obtain a definitive diagnosis. Her blood pressure readings have been erratic since presentation.  Given Mrs. Smith's demographic profile  clinical presentation  and significant stressful events  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy becomes a strong differential diagnosis. Further diagnostic investigations are warranted to confirm this and guide the appropriate management plan  aiming for a good prognosis and reduced risk of recurrence. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,16,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Case Presentation  Introduction: Meet Ms. Julia Thompson  a 65-year-old Caucasian female with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Demographics: Ms. Thompson is a retired teacher who resides in a suburb of San Francisco  California. She lives alone in her home and her nearest family  her daughter  lives in Los Angeles. Julia is an active woman who enjoys gardening and reading.  Medical History: Ms. Thompson has a previous medical history of hypertension  which has been adequately managed with prescribed medication. She is non-diabetic and non-smoker. With respect to cardiac history  she has had no prior diagnosis of ischemic or any other heart disease. Julia also has a history of depression and was recently prescribed medication by her psychiatrist following the death of her husband 6 months ago.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient experienced sudden  severe chest pain and shortness of breath while attending her husband's memorial service. She was immediately rushed to the hospital  suspecting myocardial infarction due to the intensity and abruptness of symptoms.  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". It is a transient cardiac syndrome that involves the left ventricular apical akinesis  which is often triggered by severe emotional stress. This disorder is most commonly seen in postmenopausal women and is often misdiagnosed as acute myocardial infarction. The prognosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is usually good with appropriate treatment and management of the underlying stressor.  Clinical Examination and Diagnosis: On docking in emergency room  the patient appeared anxious and distressed. Her blood pressure was slightly elevated  and ECG showed ST-segment elevation. Coronary angiography was normal  ruling out myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram demonstrated apical ballooning with preserved function at the base of the heart  typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Additionally  blood tests showed elevated heart enzymes.  Management: Ms. Thompson was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit for further monitoring. She is currently being managed conservatively with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Supportive therapy for her emotional health  including counseling and management of her depression and anxiety  are integral parts of her treatment.  In conclusion  Julia Thompson is a classic presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  characterized by sudden stress-induced cardiac symptoms in an elderly woman with a significant emotional event and a prior history of hypertension and depression. It underlines the importance of a comprehensive biological-psychosocial approach in the management of such cases."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,17,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient ID: LP231 Age: 68 Sex: Female Race: Asian Occupation: Retired school teacher  I present to you the case of a 68-year-old Asian female who recently experienced a significant life stressor. She is a retired teacher  stationed in the West Coast of the United States. She is a non-smoker and leads a relatively healthy lifestyle.  Pre-existing medical history includes well-controlled hypertension and a history of migraines  both being managed effectively through medications for over a decade. The patient has no known allergies  with a mild family history of cardiovascular diseases. Her mother died at the age of 76 from myocardial infarction.  She presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain with symptoms mimicking that of a heart attack. Elicitation of history revealed that she has been experiencing emotional stress due to the recent passing away of her spouse  a well-known precipitator for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also referred to as broken heart syndrome.  The patient experienced sudden and severe chest pain  shortness of breath  light-headedness  along with a sense of impending doom  a few hours post her spouse's funeral. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  typically associated with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Given her age  female gender  stressful trigger event  and clinical presentation  the preliminary diagnosis leads towards takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or stress cardiomyopathy is predominantly reported in post-menopausal women  with Asians and Caucasians at higher risk as compared to other races. Studies show emotional stressors  such as the death of a loved one  are common triggering events.  As we make progress in her treatment and recovery  it will be crucial to manage and monitor her emotional wellbeing  due to the evident link between psychological stress and takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Patient consent ensuring confidentiality has been obtained to discuss this case.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,18,"Slide 1: Introduction The patient we are presenting today has been diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as """"Broken Heart Syndrome"""". This is a predominantly acute and transient condition  which affects the left ventricle of the heart  resulting in cardiomyopathy.   Slide 2: Demographics The patient is a 67-year-old female of Caucasian ethnicity. According to statistical information gathered from several studies  around 90% of reported cases of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy have occurred in women aged 58 to 75  with a greater prevalence in post-menopausal women.   Slide 3: Presenting Symptomatology Our patient was admitted to the Emergency Department presenting symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath post emotional stress  which mimicked the symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction. On further examination  physical findings matched the symptoms. The EKG showed ST-segment elevation and her cardiac biomarkers were significantly elevated.   Slide 4: Background Medical History Considering her past medical history  she has been managing her hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for over a decade with lifestyle modifications and medication. She is non-smoker and non-alcoholic. Additionally  she is experiencing high levels of chronic stress due to the recent passing of her husband.   Slide 5: Diagnosis and Discussion The provisional diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy was made after the coronary angiography showed no significant blockages in the coronary arteries that could have led to a true heart attack. The ventriculography revealed the typical 'octopus' appearance of the left ventricle  often seen in Takotsubo.   Slide 6: Treatment and Prognosis While there is no specific treatment protocol for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  immediate supportive measures such as anti-platelet therapy  beta-blockers  and ACE-inhibitors have been initiated for our patient. Given her good overall health  advanced age and adequate social support  the prognosis remains good and recovery is expected over the coming weeks. Further social support and consideration of bereavement counselling may also be beneficial for her holistic health.   Slide 7: Conclusion This case demonstrates that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  although rare  should be taken into consideration as a differential diagnosis in females over 50 presenting with suspected heart attack symptoms. The condition remains under-diagnosed and a higher index of suspicion is vital for prompt diagnosis and management."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,19,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presenting to the emergency department with severe chest pain. She uses English primarily for communication and is a retired elementary school teacher. The patient lives alone and is widowed  her husband passed away three years ago due to lung cancer and since then she's been living under emotional stress.  Past Medical History: Her past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are being medically managed. She has no previous history of heart disease and no family history of sudden cardiac death. She admits she is not as physically active as she should be due to bouts of depression and anxiety. The patient does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is on medication for high blood pressure and cholesterol.   Clinical Encounter: She was noticed to appear acutely distressed  explaining that she had been experiencing chest pain since morning which she initially thought was heartburn. It was associated with a sharp  searing pain radiating to her left arm and associated with shortness of breath. She also reported feeling nauseous but did not vomit. On further inquiry  she revealed that she had been under significant emotional stress lately.  Clinical Reasoning & Disease Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has a clear predilection for post-menopausal women  particularly those in their late sixties to mid-seventies  such as our patient. The pathophysiology is postulated to be related to a surge in catecholamines  often brought on by emotional or physical stressors. This leads to a typical apical ballooning of the left ventricle  with transient systolic dysfunction mimicking an acute myocardial infarction.   The patient's symptoms  her demography and her recent periods of emotional stress make takotsubo cardiomyopathy a likely differential consideration. Nonetheless  an acute coronary syndrome will need to be ruled out initially due to an overlapping clinical presentation and the dire consequences of a missed diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,20,"Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Profile: Patient Name: Mrs. Linda Smith Age: 68 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting Complaint:  Mrs. Smith was brought to the emergency department complaining of severe  acute chest pain with shortness of breath.   Medical History: Mrs. Smith is a retired schoolteacher without a significant past medical history. She denies any prior episodes of chest pain  heart disease  hypertension  or diabetes. She has no known allergies and she does not smoke or consume alcohol. She lives alone. She recently lost her husband to a long battle with cancer  which has caused her significant psychological stress.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  she was visibly distressed  with tachycardia and slightly elevated blood pressure. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed non-specific ST-segment and T-wave changes  while initial blood tests revealed slightly raised troponin levels. An ultrasound echocardiogram showed a reduced ejection fraction with apical ballooning  a pattern not typical of myocardial infarction.  Diagnosis: Taken together with the patient’s recent emotional stress  the findings are suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced or """"broken heart"""" syndrome. Additional confirmatory tests including coronary angiography are planned.  Discussion: Although rare  takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically presents in postmenopausal women who have recently experienced significant emotional stress. The condition is often mistaken for an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) due to similar presenting symptoms and some common initial findings  however  the absence of coronary artery occlusion and the presence of the unique """"octopus pot"""" deformation of the left ventricle  as seen on echocardiogram or ventriculogram  reveal the correct diagnosis. Despite its dramatic initial presentation  most people recover fully with supportive therapy.   In conclusion  Mrs. Linda Smith's case represents the classical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,21,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-year-old Female  Objective: To present a case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) in an elderly female with an ongoing stressful life event.  Introduction: TTC  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a transient dysfunction of the myocardium typically associated with high levels of stress and emotional trauma. Prevalence rates suggest that it predominantly affects postmenopausal women.   Patient Profile: The patient  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  was brought to the emergency department with severe chest pain. The discomfort began a few hours earlier while she was dealing with the recent death of her husband. She has no previous history of chest pain or coronary artery disease.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with Lisinopril and Simvastatin respectively. She has no history of smoking  diabetes  or drug abuse. She is on no additional medications and has no reported allergies.  Presentation: The patient described a heaviness in her chest  radiating to her left arm. She looked pale and showed signs of distress. Her blood pressure on arrival was 170/90 mmHg  pulse was 95 beats/min  and respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min.  Investigation: An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in precordial leads mimicking acute myocardial infarction. However  a cardiac biomarker test showed a slight increase in troponin levels  not consistent with regular myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram and coronary angiography unveiled a reduced ejection fraction with apical ballooning of the left ventricle  a typical finding in TTC  and there was no significant obstructive coronary disease.  Discussion: The patient's presentation  ECG changes  and the distinctive changes on the echocardiogram  staying in line with her recent emotional stress  confirmed the diagnosis of TTC.  Conclusions: This highlight is given to stress the importance of considering TTC in older females presenting with chest pain  especially in the context of severe stress  despite the initial misleading ECG signs. Prompt recognition and medical management are crucial for better patient outcomes.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,22,Title: Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Female Patient  Demographic Information: Mrs. A is a 72-year-old Caucasian female who recently presented with the symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She is retired and lives alone  following the passing of her husband three years ago. She does not smoke or consume any form of alcohol.  Past Medical History: Mrs. A has a past medical history significant for well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  with medications including amlodipine and atorvastatin. An established case of well-managed anxiety disorder was diagnosed 5 years ago. She maintains a well-balanced diet and regularly walks around the neighborhood to keep physically active. Mrs. A also has a strong support network comprising her two adult independent children and her friends.   Current Presentation: Following the sudden demise of her dear longtime friend  Mrs. A experienced an unexpected intense emotional stress and presented with severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and fainting. An ECG performed suggested the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome. However  coronary angiography showed non-obstructive coronary artery disease. Based on her clinical presentation  results from examination  ECG and  angiography  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Review of Available Literature: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  or broken-heart syndrome  predominantly affects postmenopausal women with an average age ranging from 62 to 75. The risk factors for TCM include emotional or physical stress  history of neurologic or psychiatric illnesses. Most patients (approx. 79.9%) have a trigger  with emotional stress most commonly identified. In nearly 90% of cases  TCM patients present with chest pain  and they often have ST-segment elevation on ECG  leading to a misdiagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It's important to note that while major ethnic and racial variations in the incidence of TCM have not been identified  most studies have involved populations from Japan and the Western Countries.  In conclusion: Given her presentation and overall demographic- psychiatric and medical history  Mrs. A is a typical patient for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The recent emotional stress of losing a significant person in her life likely contributed as the trigger for inducing TCM.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,23,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman  Slide 1: Introduction   Patient: Mrs. X  a 68-year-old Caucasian woman  presents to the emergency department with symptoms resembling an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).  Slide 2: Demographics & Epidemiology   According to studies  around 90% of reported cases of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as broken heart syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy  are in women aged 58 to 75  most of them post-menopausal. Caucasian women seem to be the most affected group.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mrs. X has a history of hypertension  managed effectively with Antihypertensive medication. She has no known history of coronary artery disease or any other cardiovascular incidents. Recent widowing followed by profound emotional distress is noted.   Slide 4: Clinical Presentation   Mrs. X's symptoms include profound chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations. Onset of symptoms happened suddenly following an emotional breakdown related to the recent death of her husband  thus supporting the TTC diagnosis.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings   ECG shows ST-segment elevation  initially suggesting a myocardial infarction. However  subsequent coronary angiography reveals no significant coronary artery occlusion. Left ventriculography shows a distinctive pattern of apical ballooning  typical in TTC cases.   Slide 6: Psychosocial Considerations   Consideration of the emotional stressors preceding the event is crucial in TTC  as it is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. In this case  Mrs. X's bereavement served as the trigger.   Slide 7: Conclusion   Through careful consideration of clinical presentations  psychosocial circumstances  and diagnostic findings  we can accurately diagnose Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. This case highlights the importance of recognizing TTC as a differential diagnosis in post-menopausal women presenting with acute chest pain  especially with recent intense emotional stress. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,24,Subject: Patient Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  1) Patient Identification:  Ms. K is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  retired teacher  residing in Seattle  Washington. She is widowed with 2 adult children.   2) Presenting Issue: Ms. K was brought to the emergency department experiencing severe chest pain and shortness of breath which started suddenly about two hours ago. She describes the pain as crushing in nature  radiating to her left arm and shoulder. The shortness of breath has been increasing gradually over the past two hours.   3) Past Medical History: Ms. K has a history of hypertension controlled with medication (hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily). She had a significant emotional loss three weeks back when her pet of 15 years passed away. Ms. K also has a 20-year history of anxiety disorder  managed through psycho-pharmacological intervention (Sertraline 50mg daily).   4) Lifestyle Factors: Ms. K is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol moderately during social occasions only. Her diet is balanced but she admits to not keeping a regular exercise regime.   5) Family History: On the paternal side  her father died from myocardial infarction at the age of 65. Her mother is still alive at the age of 89 with controlled hypertension. No siblings or children show any signs of cardiovascular disease.   6) Socio-economic Status: Ms. K is a retiree and lives alone  but maintains regular contact with her children  who live nearby.   7) Preliminary Diagnosis: Given the symptoms and her recent emotional stress  she is suspected of having takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome.  8) Literature Backdrop: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy predominantly affects postmenopausal women with a mean age of 66-75 years. More than 90% of reported cases are in women. Recent emotional stress is a common precipitant. Hypertension is a common comorbidity. While Caucasians are known to get the condition  it was first identified in Japan and continues to be reported frequently there.  9) Plan: Initiate a full cardiac workup to confirm suspected diagnosis. This may include an EKG  an echocardiogram  and possibly cardiac catheterization if required. Reach out to Psychiatry for evaluation and possible intervention regarding anxiety and recent emotional distress. Initiate the conservative management of symptoms with ACE inhibitors  Beta-blockers  and Aspirin under cardiology supervision. Ensure that the patient and her children understand the suspected diagnosis  the proposed investigations  and possible future implications.  References:  1) Templin C  Ghadri JR  Diekmann J  et al.

She is a retired high school teacher and currently lives alone. She is a non-smoker and moderate alcohol consumer. Her weight is within the normal range for her height  and she exercises regularly. She has no known drug allergies.   Past Medical History: She has been previously diagnosed with hyperlipidemia for which she takes atorvastatin. She also has a diagnosis of well-controlled hypertension and is on amlodipine for the same. She has no personal or familial history of heart disease. The patient has a past history of depression and anxiety  and she currently takes escitalopram to manage her psychological conditions.   Her surgical history includes a unilateral mastectomy due to breast cancer  and she has been in remission for the last 10 years. She has been consistent with her annual screening for breast cancer and other regular health check-ups.   Presenting Complaints: She presented to the emergency department with acute onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started an hour ago. She describes the pain as squeezing  located in the center and radiating to the left arm. The patient mentioned experiencing stressful life events  the death of a close friend recently.   Clinical Assessment & Diagnosis: Based on her symptoms  EKG changes (ST-segment elevation)  elevated troponin levels and the presence of apical ballooning on echocardiography without angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   In conclusion  our 67-year-old female patient represents the typical demographic and clinical profile of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is more commonly diagnosed in postmenopausal women with a preceding history of intense emotional or physical stress. Besides  the patient’s past medical history of psychological conditions and cancer might also have contributed to her susceptibility to this syndrome. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,26,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient's Profile: Name: Mrs. X  Age: 75 years  Gender: Female   Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired school teacher Residential History: Resident of Ohio  United States   Presenting Complaint: Mrs. X presents with unexpected  acute chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain is severe and is described as 'crushing' in nature  commenced after she received the news of her husband's sudden and unexpected passing.   Past Medical History: Mrs. X has a history of hypertension  for which she has been taking medication (amlodipine) for the past ten years. Otherwise  she has been generally healthy for her age. She does not smoke  but enjoys a glass of wine occasionally. She does not have any known allergies.   Family History: Her parents died of age-related illnesses. Her elder sister passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 72  and her brother died from prostate cancer at 78.   Social History: Mrs. X lives alone in her home. She has two children who live in different states. She has a good circle of friends and is actively involved in community gatherings and welfare activities.  Further Investigations: Given her age and the sudden  severe onset of symptoms  further investigations revealed that Mrs. X had suffered an episode of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  more colloquially known as 'broken heart syndrome'. This form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy creates a temporary disruption of the heart's normal pumping function.   Clinical studies have shown that up to 90% of reported cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy occur in women  primarily postmenopausal. The exact cause is unknown  but it's thought to be related to the body's response to high levels of stress hormones. Therefore  the sudden death of Mrs. X's husband likely triggered the onset of this condition. Evidence suggests that people with a history of a neurological condition or a mental health disorder may be at higher risk.    Plan: She would benefit from beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and supportive psychotherapy to manage stress. Additionally  regular follow-ups with her cardiologist and general practitioner are advised to monitor her recovery. Education regarding the early recognition and management of stress should be given. Family members should be informed and counseled for the patient's better care and quick recovery.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,27,Title: Presentation of a patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome)  I. Introduction: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female with an existing history of anxiety disorders. She presents a classic case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or the 'broken heart' syndrome. She is a widow who lost her spouse two years ago and has been living alone since then. Although typically healthy  her psychological stress levels have been high due to recent bereavement of her close friend.  II. Past Medical History: The patient has a non-alarming medical history with managed hypertension for the past 7 years. She also has a diagnosed anxiety disorder. The patient is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption. She has been on regular medication for her hypertension and anxiety  which include Lisinopril 20 mg daily and Sertraline (Zoloft) 50mg daily. The patient has no history of heart disease  stroke  or lung diseases. No family history of early-onset cardiovascular diseases was reported.  III. Current Presentation: The patient came in presenting symptoms of fatigue  shortness of breath  and chest pain  which she described as discomfort in the center of her chest often radiating to her left-upper extremity. These symptoms folllowed right after her intense emotional trigger event  the death of a friend  suggesting a potential diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   IV. Observations & Diagnosis: Given her age  sex  and recent emotional stress followed by chest discomfort  a preliminary diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy appears to fit the current presentation. This clinical syndrome is characterized by acute reversible heart failure with distinctive apical ballooning of the left ventricle. This often occurs in post-menopausal women  following a severe emotional stressor.    V. Plan:  The examination plan includes conducting an electrocardiogram (ECG)  blood tests  echocardiogram  and potentially a coronary angiography to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions such as acute myocardial infarction  which can present similarly.  In conclusion  we presented a whitened post-menopausal female suffering extreme emotional stress followed by characteristic symptoms of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy for further evaluation and management. It's important to note that although this condition often resolves over time  its management and understanding are key to prevent it in individuals exposed to emotional stressors.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,28,Title: Case Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  I. Introduction: We are presenting a case of a 68-year-old Caucasian female named Mrs. B. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are well-controlled with medication. She is non-smoker and not diabetic. Mrs B’s previous medical record does not indicate any coronary artery disease. She lives alone and recently lost her husband  which might have contributed to acute emotional stress in her life.  II. Clinical Presentation: Mrs. B first presented to the ER with severe chest pain that began suddenly while she was at home. She described the pain as a sharp  constant  and nearly intolerable  located in the substernal area and radiating to her left arm. It was associated with shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and nausea. The pain was non-responsive to nitroglycerin tablets administered by the Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) en route to the hospital.  III. Examination & Investigations: On arrival to our facility  her vital signs included: BP 150/90 mmHg  HR 110/min  RR 20/min  Temp 98.6°F  SpO2 93% on room air. ECG showed ST-elevation in the anterior leads  highly suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. Troponin levels came back significantly elevated  indicative of cardiac damage.  IV. Diagnosis: On the assumption of a STEMI  Mrs. B was immediately moved to the cardiac catheterization lab. However  coronary angiography came back normal  with no apparent atherosclerotic lesions. An echocardiogram showed apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basilar segments – a classic sign of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) or Broken Heart Syndrome. The patient’s symptoms  along with ventriculogram findings  the absence of coronary artery disease  and the recent severe emotional stress to which she had been exposed  justified the TTC diagnosis.  V. Management and Outcome: The patient was managed conservatively with supportive care  including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and aspirin. She remained in intensive care under continuous monitoring for several days but eventually made a good recovery and was discharged home with a plan for outpatient follow-up and stress management counseling.  VI. Conclusion: This case highlights the critical role of mental stress in the precipitation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Clinicians should consider the diagnosis in post-menopausal women presenting with the acute onset of chest pain following a significant emotional stressor.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,29,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Female Patient  Patient Presentation: Ms. Thompson is a 68-year old Caucasian female who recently presented with severe chest pain. Accompanying symptoms included shortness of breath  occasional nausea  and lightheadedness. Ms. Thompson has been a widow for the last five years and lives alone after the death of her husband. She has two adult children living out of state.  Medical History: Ms. Thompson has a past medical history of hypertension controlled with medication. There is no history of diabetes mellitus or hyperlipidemia. She has never smoked  and alcohol intake was limited to social gatherings. There is no family history of heart diseases.   Inciting Incident: Before the onset of her current symptoms  Ms. Thompson reported she had been dealing with significant stress due to the sudden death of her close friend and the subsequent bereavement process.  Current Clinical Picture: On physical examination  Ms. Thompson appeared mildly distressed. Her blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  pulse was 82 bpm  respiratory rate was 20 breaths per min  and her oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.  Investigations: An EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. High-sensitivity troponin levels were also elevated. A subsequent echocardiogram revealed a typical picture of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  with apical ballooning and hyperkinesis of the basal segments.  Diagnosis: Given the presence of physical stressor  characteristic echocardiogram findings  and inconspicuous coronary angiography  Ms. Thompson was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is most commonly observed in post-menopausal women  typically precipitated by emotional or physical stress. This tends to be a temporary condition often mistaken for an acute coronary syndrome given its similar presentation. However  unlike in a heart attack  patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy have no coronary artery occlusion.   Management: Ms. Thompson was promptly started on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors  and she was educated about stress management and reducing anxiety. Long term follow-up and monitoring are planned for Ms. Thompson as recovery is usually expected in weeks or months  but recurrence is possible.  In conclusion  the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy should always be considered in older females presenting with chest pain  especially when precipitated by significant stress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,30,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Williams is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who presented to the emergency department with central chest discomfort  which began earlier that day. She described the sensation as a severe  squeezing discomfort that was radiating towards her left shoulder and arm. The pain was increased with activity and somewhat relieved with rest.  Past Medical History:  Ms. Williams' past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are well-controlled with medication. She has no known history of coronary artery disease  diabetes  tobacco use  or other significant health issues. She does  however  have a reported history of anxiety disorder. She reports taking her medications regularly and reports no known drug allergies.   Recent Psychosocial History:  Interestingly  Ms. Williams recently endured a significant emotional stressor  as her husband of 40 years passed away just two weeks ago.  Demographic Representation:  According to literature  this presentation is consistent with that of the typical patient diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy or Broken Heart Syndrome). This condition is primarily found in postmenopausal women between the ages of 58-75  and frequently presents with symptoms mimicking that of acute coronary syndrome. It is also important to note that emotional stressors  such as Ms. Williams' recent bereavement  are a common precipitant of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition is more prevalent among Caucasians  and predisposed by psychological factors and history of neurologic or psychiatric diseases.   In conclusion  Ms. Williams' presenting symptoms  demographics  and recent history place her within the typical clinical picture of a patient with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Further diagnostic investigations  including EKG and echocardiogram  will be essential in confirming this diagnosis and guiding treatment options.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,31,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Introduction:  Our patient today is a 71-year-old  Asian ethnicity female named Mrs. Tanaka. She is from Tokyo  Japan - a significant demographic as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is considerably prevalent among Asians.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Tanaka is a widow who has been living alone since her husband's death 5 years ago. Notably  she has a well-managed history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. There's also a significant emotional stress history related to a sudden death in the family.  Presenting Problem: Recently  Mrs. Tanaka was brought to the emergency room after an episode of severe chest pain  similar to a myocardial infarction  subsequent to hearing the shocking news of a close relative's sudden death.   Clinical Examination & Testing: Initial cardiac enzyme study showed a slight elevation. An electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads  raising suspicion of an acute myocardial infarction. However  a following coronary angiogram did not show any significant coronary artery disease  which is a common finding in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. An echocardiogram revealed a characteristic finding for TCM — apical ballooning of the left ventricle with a hyperdynamic base  mimicking an octopus trap  the supposed origin of the disease name.  Conclusion: Mrs. Tanaka's demographic profile  presenting symptoms  emotional stress circumstances  and characteristic test findings are in line with the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Though rare  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome' often presents in postmenopausal women triggered by emotional stress events.  In many cases like that of Mrs. Tanaka  with prompt diagnosis and management  prognosis can be favorable. Patient education and therapeutic coping techniques with psychologists might be a worthy intervention to prevent future similar episodes given her emotional stress history.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,32,Title: A Clinical Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year old Caucasian female  Mrs. L  from rural Midwestern United States. She is post-menopausal and is retired from her profession as a teacher.  Medical History: Mrs. L has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which she is on medication (ACE inhibitors and statins  respectively). Apart from this  her medical record is unremarkable; she has no history of substance abuse and doesn't smoke. She lived a fairly active lifestyle until recently when she started experiencing symptoms of fatigue. She has a history of moderately controlled stress and her husband passed away a few months ago.  Presenting Symptoms: She visited the emergency department (ED) following the sudden onset of severe chest pain  initially interpreted as acute myocardial infarction. The chest pain was associated with shortness of breath. It was noted that the onset of these symptoms occurred post a severe emotional distress event – the death anniversary of her late husband.  Investigations: Upon admission  EKG showed ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion  leading the initial diagnosis towards an acute coronary syndrome  but subsequent coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary disease. The distinctive shape of the left ventricle  appearing as akinetic apical ballooning  seen on echocardiogram lead us to the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Also known as Broken Heart Syndrome).  Conclusion: Our patient  Mrs. L  represents the typical demographic and clinical picture of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy patient as per literature. Primarily post-menopausal women  often with a sharp emotional trigger  presenting with symptoms mimicking an acute coronary syndrome with distinctive imaging features and absence of obstructive coronary disease.  It's crucial to identify these patients accurately as the management and prognosis greatly differ from those with coronary artery disease and avoid unnecessary invasive diagnostic methods along with providing the right emotional and pharmacological therapeutic measures.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,33,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  I. Patient Demographics The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian female  retired teacher  living with her elderly spouse in a suburban community. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially. She is originally from Eastern Europe but has lived in the United States for more than 40 years.  II. Past Medical History Looking at her health history  the patient has been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which she has taken medication for the last decade. She also has a history of anxiety and has experienced several major life stressors in the past year  including the death of a family member and financial strain due to medical expenses. No known history of coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction. She has been consistent with her annual healthcare check-ups. Family history reveals her mother had heart disease  and her father died of a stroke at an old age.  III. Presenting Symptoms The patient came to the emergency department exhibiting symptoms similar to a heart attack  including significant chest pain  shortness of breath  nausea  and palpitations. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was conducted and it mimicked the changes typically seen in someone having a heart attack  however  coronary angiography showed no blockages in the coronary arteries. She described an exacerbation of her recurring anxiety symptoms in the weeks leading up to the event.   IV. Diagnosis Based on pathognomonic findings on the left ventricle during echocardiography (ballooning and reduced ejection fraction)  the patient has been diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as broken heart syndrome  stress cardiomyopathy  or apical ballooning syndrome. TTC is frequently seen in postmenopausal women  often associated with severe physical or emotional stressors  thus aligning with the patient's characteristics.  V. Proposed Treatment Plan Plan to manage her condition includes beta-blockers to control blood pressure and heart rate  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to improve heart function and reduce potential complications  and possible anti-anxiety medication for the distress. Psychotherapy and stress management techniques are also recommended to manage her anxiety levels. Regular cardiac check-ups would be warranted to monitor recovery and ensure secondary prevention.  The patient's condition underpins the importance of psychological health in relation to physical wellbeing and the significant influence gender plays in some cardiovascular diseases. This case underscores a need for better understanding and investigation of TTC and related conditions.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,34,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: Patient: Mrs. Ann Sullivan Age: 72 Years  Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting issue: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome)  Medical History: Mrs. Ann Sullivan  a retired schoolteacher  presented to the Emergency Department with chest pains and shortness of breath. She described her pain as severe and said it began abruptly during an emotionally intense argument with her daughter.  Ann has a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension  for which she has been taking Lisinopril for the last 10 years. She is also a former smoker (20 cigarettes/day for 30 years)  but quit 15 years ago. Ann has no known allergies.  Family medical history reveals that her mother had a myocardial infarction at age 66 and died at age 70 due to heart failure. Her father lived to 90 with no significant medical issues. Her younger sister is alive and well at 68 with no significant medical history.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  Ann appeared anxious and in distress. Her blood pressure was 158/85 mmHg  her pulse was 88 beats per minute  and her respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed tachycardia but no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Lungs were clear to auscultation.  Diagnostic Tests: An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed immediately upon arrival  which showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads consistent with an acute coronary syndrome. Elevated Troponin levels were consistent with myocardial injury. However  coronary angiography showed no evidence of significant atherosclerotic disease.   Left ventriculography and echocardiography revealed a typical appearance of apical ballooning with preserved basal function - a pattern consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or stress cardiomyopathy.  Conclusion: Ann was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition predominantly seen in post-menopausal women that can mimic acute coronary syndrome. It is often preceded by emotional or physical stress  as was the case with Ann. Her condition will be managed with supportive care  and she will be monitored for complications such as heart failure  arrhythmias  and mitral regurgitation.  Ann will also be given resources to manage her stress and conduct a healthy lifestyle. This includes a referral to a psychologist for emotional support and stress management strategies. Ann's case highlights the significant interplay of emotional stress and heart health.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,35,"Subject: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Case Presentation  I. Introduction  We have a 77-year-old Caucasian female patient presenting with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced or """"broken heart"""" syndrome. This particular case aligns with the existing literature indicating that takotsubo cardiomyopathy predominantly affects postmenopausal women.  II. Past Medical History and Lifestyle The patient has previously been generally healthy with no significant history of cardiovascular disease. She is a non-smoker but led a mildly sedentary lifestyle. Though  she does not have a personal or familial history of mental illness  she has been managing her moderately severe anxiety through steady medication. Her only other known medical condition is controlled hypertension. No history of illicit substance use was reported.   III. Presenting Symptoms The patient reported to the Emergency Room presenting with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. On further assessment  the symptoms appeared to be similar to acute coronary syndrome. She describes the chest pain as a heavy pressure  radiating to her left arm. Notably  these symptoms had been preceded by an acute emotional stress event – the recent and unexpected loss of her spouse.  IV. Preliminary Diagnosis  Given the clinical presentation  patient's age  gender  the severe emotional stressor and absence of significant coronary artery disease  a preliminary diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made.   Clinical investigations  including echocardiogram and cardiac biomarker tests  are underway to confirm the diagnosis. EKG demonstrated ST-Elevation in leads II  III and aVF and troponin levels were found to be elevated on initial lab work.  V. Risk Factors and Prognosis Key risk factors for our patient include her age  gender  post-menopausal status  recent grievous emotional stressor  mild sedentary lifestyle  and history of anxiety. Despite takotsubo cardiomyopathy's dramatic presentation  the prognosis is generally favorable with appropriate treatment and management of triggering stressors.    VI. Management Plan  Given a confirmed diagnosis  our treatment plan would focus initially managing chest pain and potential arrhythmias  stabilizing cardiovascular functions  and then long-term anxiety/stress management. This could include beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors  and psychological support or counseling. It is also important to closely monitor her given her age and existing hypertension.  This patient's case highlights the significant interplay of emotional stress and cardiovascular health  and the necessity of a well-rounded approach in managing cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,36,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in an Elderly Female  Slide 1:  Introduction  Good morning/afternoon. I will be presenting the case of a 70-year-old Caucasian female who presented with symptoms consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy also known as Broken Heart Syndrome.   Slide 2:  Patient’s Background   Our patient  Mrs. A.  is a widow living alone. She has a past medical history of hypertension  depression  and mild asthma for which she takes medication. She recently experienced an intensely stressful event due to the death of her close friend.   Slide 3:   Presenting complaints  Mrs. A. presented to the ER with a sudden onset of severe chest pain and dyspnea. Patient described the pain as a """"crushing"""" sensation with radiation to her left arm.   Slide 4:  Observations & Results  On observation  Mrs. A was in acute distress  diaphoretic and hyperventilating.  Her vital signs were HR: 110 bpm  BP: 155/90 mmHg  RR: 22 bpm  Temp: 98.7 F  Oxygen Saturation: 90% on room air. ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads and blood test revealed slightly elevated cardiac troponin levels.  Slide 5:  Imaging & Diagnosis  A coronary angiogram did not reveal any obstructive coronary disease. However  the left ventriculogram showed classic apical ballooning consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This  along with her recent personal loss  clinched the diagnosis of stress-induced cardiomyopathy  or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6:  Management & Follow Up  In terms of management  Mrs. A was started on angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and beta-blockers. She was also referred to a psychologist for grief counseling  considering the known link between emotional stress and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. On reevaluation  Mrs. A's symptoms significantly improved over a period of two months.  Slide 7:  Conclusion   In conclusion  this case highlights the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with symptoms mimicking a heart attack  especially in the context of recent intense psychological stress.   Slide 8:  Acknowledgements   I would like to acknowledge the Cardiology and Psychology team for their accurate diagnosis  management and follow-up of the patient.   Slide 9:  Questions and comments  Now  I will be glad to answer any questions or respond to comments."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,37,"Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile:  Patient is a 67-year-old  post-menopausal Caucasian female presenting with acute chest pain. She is currently living alone and is recently widowed. Casewise  her Body Mass Index is 26  meaning she is slightly overweight  but she has no significant history of obesity.  Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of hypertension for which she has been taking antihypertensive medications regularly. Her hypertensive episodes have been characterized by systolic values in the range of 140-150 mmHg and diastolic values within 80-90 mmHg. Lifestyle changes were recommended but she has struggled with consistently maintaining a healthier lifestyle. She also has a diagnosed and treated anxiety disorder. She does not smoke  nor does she consume alcohol.  Psychosocial History: In the past year  the patient lost her husband  a highly stressful and traumatic event. Ever since this incident  she has had bouts of severe emotional distress and periods of severe loneliness  which have heightened her anxiety levels.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain  radiating to her left arm  of sudden onset. She also reports feelings of shortness of breath  fatigue  and has had a recent episode of fainting. These symptoms mimic an acute myocardial infarction  but the patient has no significant history of coronary artery disease.  Thoughts: Given this patient's gender  age  stressful life events  and presenting symptoms  she is significantly at risk for developing takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome."""" Although thought to be rare  this condition typically affects post-menopausal females and is often preceded by a severe stressful event. Diagnosis would be confirmed with an echocardiogram showing the classic """"octopus pot"""" appearance of the left ventricle and lack of significant occlusion in the coronary arteries."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,38,Title: Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of hypertension and recently experienced high levels of emotional stress subsequent to the death of her spouse. She is a retiree and a non-smoker  lives alone  and has a family history of cardiovascular disease. She is currently taking an antihypertensive medication and lives an active lifestyle.   Chief Complain: The patient presented to the Emergency Department with acute onset epigastric discomfort radiating to her chest  accompanied by dyspnea  palpitations and generalized weakness. The pain began suddenly  waking her from sleep.  Past Medical and Surgical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  controlled with medication. She does not have a history of coronary artery disease or any previous cardiac surgery.  Family History: Her father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 74. Her mother is still alive at 90 with Alzheimer’s disease. She has two siblings  one of which has been diagnosed with hypertension.  Physical Examination: On examination  she appeared anxious and diaphoretic with a blood pressure of 158/92 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. She was afebrile. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal first and second heart sounds with no audible murmurs  rubs or gallops.   Investigations: Electrocardiogram shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  which suggested a possible anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  coronary angiogram showed no significant coronary artery disease  but there was a characteristic apical ballooning of the left ventricle  suggesting Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Blood samples demonstrated slightly elevated troponin levels.    Diagnosis: Given the symptoms  clinical  and investigation findings  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Plan: The patient's management was supportive  with continuation of her antihypertensive medication and introduction of heart failure medications including beta blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. Psychotherapy was recommended to help her cope with the stressful event  and she was recommended to participate in regular physical activity and maintain a balanced diet to manage her condition.   In conclusion  this case highlights that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  while rare  should be considered in postmenopausal women presenting with symptoms akin to myocardial infarction  especially in the setting of recent severe emotional stress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,39,Title: Case Presentation: A Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile:   Mrs. Y is a 75-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history significant for hypertension and major depressive disorder. She is recently widowed and has been reporting increased episodes of acute anxiety and stress following her husband's death. She is retired and lives alone. She neither smokes nor drinks alcohol and does not have a recorded history of illicit drug usage. She does not have a family history of heart conditions.   Presenting Condition:   Mrs. Y was brought into the ED after experiencing an episode of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain was sudden in onset  radiated to the left side of the body  and was associated with light-headedness but no loss of consciousness.   Initial diagnosis based on her presentation and EKG findings were suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Still  subsequent cardiac angiography demonstrated no significant coronary artery blockage  ruling out the likelihood of ACS. Ventriculography  however  revealed an unusual contraction pattern in the left ventricle characterised by apical ballooning and hypercontraction of the basal walls  indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).   Her lab results showed marginally elevated cardiac troponin levels  common in TCM patients indicating myocardial injury. Her B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was also elevated  indicating heart failure.   Management and Outcome:   Mrs. Y was started on beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics to manage her symptoms and reduce the likelihood of heart failure following the TCM. She was additionally referred for psychological therapy given her stressed emotional state and diagnosed depression.   Conclusion:  This case highlights the link between emotional stress and TCM  predominantly affecting postmenopausal women. It underscores the importance of considering TCM as a differential diagnosis in older women presenting with chest pain and signs of ACS. It also notes the importance of psychological support in managing patients with TCM.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,41,"Patient Presentation:  I would like to present a case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a 67-year-old Caucasian woman. She was brought into the emergency department presenting with severe  crushing chest pain that developed suddenly while she was at her granddaughter's wedding. She describes it as similar to """"an elephant sitting on my chest."""" Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath  nausea  and palpitations.   According to the demographic data drawn from the literature  takotsubo cardiomyopathy is significantly more prevalent in postmenopausal women  with the average age of presentation being in the late sixties. Thus  our patient is typical of the wider demographic.    Looking at her medical history  she has been otherwise healthy with no diagnosis of chronic disease. She has never smoked and drinks alcohol sparingly. Given the absence of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  or diabetes  conventional causes of acute chest pain such as myocardial infarction would have been less likely; however  it's critical to keep in mind that acute chest pain in older adults should always be treated urgently  regardless of the presence or absence of these risk factors.   Psychiatric history presents a history of chronic anxiety and depression. It's noteworthy that takotsubo cardiomyopathy is often associated with preceding emotional or physical stress  and it's possibly related to the stress of the event she was attending. Unfortunately  our patient lost her husband recently  which may have increased her emotional stress levels significantly. As per family  she has not been coping well and has exhibited symptoms of anxiety and depression.   In the clinical context  these findings strongly and consistently steer towards takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome."""" This syndrome mimics the symptoms of a myocardial infarction and is often diagnosed after coronary artery disease has been ruled out. The only significant challenge with this diagnosis is to distinguish it from an acute myocardial infarction  which is crucial in older adults presenting with acute onset of severe chest pain. It carries a good prognosis in most cases  with complete recovery seen in most patients."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,42,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  Patient Profile: Name: Mary Johnson Age: 68 Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Marital Status: Widowed Occupation: Retired school teacher   Chief Complaint: Mary Johnson presents to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath following the death of her husband three days ago. The symptoms are severe and radiate to her left arm.  Past Medical History: Mary has a past medical history of Hypertension  which she is controlling with medication. Her lipids has been marginally high and she has been attempting to manage this profile through diet. Otherwise  she has no history of psychiatric illness  drug or alcohol abuse. Has never smoked. She has had no prior cardiovascular disease.  Clinical Presentation: Upon examination  her blood pressure is found to be transiently elevated. Physical examination reveals tachycardia and tachypnea. An EKG was conducted due to her symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome  which showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Her troponin I levels are also increased. Echocardiogram reveals apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved basal function  indicative of TTC.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or apical ballooning syndrome  is usually seen in postmenopausal women  with a typical presentation after substantial emotional stress. Mary’s demographic profile is consistent with the typical patient populations affected by this condition. The sudden death of her spouse  coupled with her clinical presentation and diagnostic test results  strongly suggest a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,43,"Title: Case Presentation on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Good day  everyone. Today  I'd like to present the case of a 71-year-old Caucasian female patient who presented with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  a condition often referred to as """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Our patient  Mrs. J  is a retired school teacher living in a suburban  non-smoking household. She has a personal medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes but no past history of cardiac diseases. She has been taking Lisinopril and Metformin for her underlying conditions. There is no family history of cardiomyopathy or other heart diseases  but her mother had diabetes and her father  hyperlipidemia.  She presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and dyspnea  with symptoms mimicking that of acute myocardial infarction. The onset of her symptoms was sudden  beginning earlier the same day  following a heated argument with her adult son. Her blood pressure upon admission was elevated at 159/85 mmHg  which led us to consider an acute cardiovascular event.  An electrocardiogram (ECG) performed showed T-wave inversion in the precordial leads  stimulating ST-elevation myocardial infarction. However  a subsequent coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries. Echocardiography demonstrated reduced left ventricular function with apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesia  unique characteristics of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Further physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than her elevated blood pressure. The laboratory findings  however  showed mild leukocytosis and elevated troponin T levels  indicating cardiac damage. Interestingly  her lipid profiles were within normal limits.  The case of Mrs. J is characteristic of the typical Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy patient  who are predominantly postmenopausal women experiencing significant emotional or physical stress. Treatment for Mrs. J consisted of beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and diuretics achieving an optimal result  and she's being scheduled for regular follow-ups in the cardiology outpatient clinic.  This presentation underscores the significance of considering Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in differential diagnoses in apparently healthy  elderly women presenting with chest pain and ECG changes."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,44,Title: Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Female Patient   Introduction:   I present the case of a 72-year-old Caucasian female patient who is currently living in a suburban neighborhood and has recently been diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a transient cardiac syndrome characterized by severe left ventricular dysfunction.  Demographics and Past Medical History:   Our patient is retired and widowed with two adult sons. She used to work as a school teacher and is now living alone since the death of her husband five years ago. She has a history of depression and reported periods of high stress since her spouse's death.  The patient's medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which she has been managing for fifteen years with proper medication and lifestyle changes. She has no known allergies and has no family history of any cardiac diseases. She was a casual smoker in her early twenties but stopped 50 years ago and has been consuming alcohol in moderation.  Recent Presentation:  In recent times  following a particular episode of intense emotional stress  she reported severe chest pain and shortness of breath  mimicking the symptoms of myocardial infarction. She was immediately admitted to the hospital.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  no significant jugular venous distention or abnormal heart sounds were perceived. Her blood pressure was slightly high at 137/85 mm Hg  and ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the inferolateral leads. Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated. Surprisingly  cardiac catheterization did not reveal any significant obstructive coronary artery disease.  Diagnosis and Conclusion:  An echocardiogram was performed  which displayed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction of about 40%  classic signs of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient was diagnosed accordingly and was subsequently started on ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers to manage her symptoms.  Our patient's demographics and presentation align with the literature stating that takotsubo cardiomyopathy most commonly affects postmenopausal women and can often be precipitated by episodes of severe emotional stress.  Further management includes stress management therapies to prevent recurrence  close monitoring of patient's cardiac function  and ongoing management of her underlying chronic conditions.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,45,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Presentation  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian woman  retired  with complains of chest pain and shortness of breath. These symptoms occurred acutely following the death of her husband  an event she found extremely stressful.  Past Medical History  Her past medical history includes controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which she has been prescribed Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily and Atorvastatin 10mg daily  respectively. Her BMI is within the overweight range at 28. Debilitating medical conditions  malignancies  or surgeries are non-contributory. The patient does not smoke  consume alcohol or employ illicit substances. She reports that she is fairly active for her age and generally prepares nutrient-dense meals at home.  Her family's medical history is significant for cardiovascular diseases  with her father dying of a myocardial infarction at the age of 72  and her mother having been diagnosed with congestive heart disease in her late 60s. She has three adult children in good health.  Literature Evidence  The patient's demographic factors and history are representative of the typical profile of a person with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken-heart syndrome). According to literature  the vast majority (80%-90%) of reported cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy occur in post-menopausal women  with an average age at diagnosis around 67 years old. Caucasian race is the most represented ethnicity in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy cohorts. Common triggers of this condition often involve intense emotional or physical stress  such as the death of a loved one. Concurrently  cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and family history of cardiac disease are often present in these patients  as illustrated in our patient presentation.    This patient’s presentation is therefore in line with the typical demographic profile and characteristics seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  highlighting the importance of considering this condition in older women presenting with acute onset chest pain following a significant emotional stressor.    Thank you.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,46,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Introduction: Thank you for joining me for this quick presentation on a patient presenting with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy frequently mimics acute coronary syndrome and typically affects postmenopausal women.  Case Presentation: Our patient is Mrs. Helen  a 68-year-old Caucasian woman. Epidemiological data shows that up to 90% of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy are women aged above 50  with a higher prevalence in postmenopausal Caucasian women.  Medical History: Mrs. Helen has no known significant past medical history of any systemic and chronic illnesses  indicating that she was generally healthy prior to this event. No cardiovascular disease  diabetes  or hypertension reported  but a notable history of anxiety and depression  which is a common predisposing factor in Takotsubo patients due to its association with emotional stress. She has not had any surgical procedures in the past  and she does not smoke or drink alcohol excessively.  Presenting Complaints: She visited the emergency department presenting with sudden severe chest pain and shortness of breath  which started following an emotional upset at home. The chest pain was described as being similar to a heart attack. On physical examination  her blood pressure was mildly elevated  and clinical cardiovascular examination was unremarkable.  Current Diagnosis: After performing an echocardiography and angiography  Mrs. Helen was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The most decisive factors being: her heart's abnormal contraction pattern on echocardiography  a lack of obstruction in the coronary arteries found on angiography  and the precipitating emotional stress.  Conclusion: In conclusion  recognizing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a unique pathology is essential  especially given its presentation mimics the typical ischemic heart diseases. It is vital to understand the demographic patterns and differential diagnoses to manage and treat such patients effectively. Despite being an overlooked condition  awareness and a high index of suspicion  particularly among older women under emotional stress  can help in prompt diagnosis and management.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,47,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Presentation in a Postmenopausal Woman  Patient Profile: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian woman  retired from an administrative position. Her BMI falls within the appropriate range for her age and height. She lives alone and is a widow for the past seven years after a successful marriage of 40 years. She is a mother of three well-settled adults and is a non-smoker.   Presenting Symptoms: The patient was brought to the emergency department after experiencing severe chest pain  mild shortness of breath  and nausea for an hour. She states that her symptoms began after a heated argument with her son.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of well-managed hypertension and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago  which is under control with metformin. She maintains a consistent routine of diet and moderate-intensity walking based on the diabetes management advice from her primary care doctor. She has no history of ischemic heart disease  no record of drug or alcohol misuse  and does not smoke. She has undergone regular screening for cholesterol and thyroid function without abnormalities  and other than intermittent episodes of anxiety  generally lives a healthy life.  Recent Events: The patient underwent severe emotional stress following a family argument earlier today – a classic trigger of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The situation was particularly distressing due to an ongoing conflict involving her children.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome  is a disease affecting primarily postmenopausal women  with more than 90% of reported cases being women aged between 58 and 75. Emotional or physical stress often precipitates the disease leading to acute coronary syndrome-like symptoms. Our patient’s demographics  presentation  and recent stress event make it highly probable that she could be suffering from takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Immediate diagnosis through echocardiography or cardiac MRI  along with angiographic exclusion of obstructive coronary disease  and timely management can prevent potential severe complications.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,48,"Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Profile: Mrs. A is a 68-year-old  white  post-menopausal woman residing in an urban setting in North America. She has been independently managing her lifestyle since her husband passed away 5 years ago.  Past Medical History: Mrs. A has a history of hypertension  chronic stress  and general anxiety disorder  for which she has been receiving medication and psychotherapy  respectively. She does not have any history of cardiovascular disease  diabetes or other chronic diseases. She has a fairly active lifestyle  including walking for exercise. Mrs. A had quit smoking 30 years ago  and reports to be a moderate consumer of alcohol.  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. A presented emergency care with severe chest pain and breathlessness immediately after receiving news about a burglary at her house. She describes the pain as similar to """"an elephant sitting on my chest"""" and assumed she was experiencing a heart attack.  Relevant Investigations: Upon admittance  her ECG showed ST-segment elevations  leading to the suspicion of acute myocardial infarction. However  subsequent angiographic examination revealed no significant coronary artery disease that would explain the ECG changes and symptoms. Lab tests showed a slight increase in cardiac muscle damage markers while left ventriculogram demonstrated mid-left ventricular wall motion abnormality  a typical ballooning appearance with no identifiable coronary lesion  leading to a probable diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Summary: Mrs. A is a typical patient of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  as majority of cases are post-menopausal women  averagely aged around 67 years who have experienced an emotional or physical stress event. The prevalence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is 7-10% among patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The condition frequently mimics myocardial infarction  with similar presenting symptoms and ECG changes  hence careful evaluation is necessary to ensure accurate diagnosis."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,49,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Presentation: Ms. A is a 75-year-old Caucasian female  a retired school teacher who lives alone. She was brought into the emergency department experiencing acute chest pain with dyspnea and excessive sweating. Her symptoms began suddenly after she received news of her second son's death in a car accident.   Past Medical History: Aside from regular age-related conditions such as mild hypertension and osteoarthritis  which have been well-controlled with medication  Ms. A has been generally healthy with no history of cardiac disease. She had no pre-existing heart conditions and has never smoked. She occasionally consumed alcohol but quit a decade ago. Ms. A has a history of anxiety and went through a period of depression following the death of her husband two years ago but had been coping well with the help of a psychologist and family support.  Demographics and Risks: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more commonly seen in postmenopausal women accounting for over 85% of reported cases  substantially mirroring the profile of Ms. A. Known triggers for this condition include severe emotional or physical stress  which is consistent with the sudden shock Ms. A experienced with the loss of her son. Furthermore  Ms. A's pre-existing psychological conditions  anxiety  and former depressive episode could potentially increase her vulnerability to the manifestations of this syndrome.  In conclusion  Ms. A is a typical representation of patients affected by takotsubo cardiomyopathy according to existing literature  her demographics and recent emotional distress align well with the profile of patients at risk of developing this condition.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,50,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction   Patient: Mrs. K.A.  a 72-year-old Caucasian female  retired school librarian. She presented to the hospital having suffered a sudden  intense emotional trauma.  Slide 2: Demographics   Recent studies indicate that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM) is primarily found in postmenopausal women  with almost 90% of reported cases being women over 50 years old.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mrs. K.A's medical history includes hypertension and dyslipidemia  both controlled with medication. She has no known history of coronary artery disease  diabetes  or any other significant illnesses.   Slide 4: Presenting Complaint   Mrs. K.A. presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe chest pain. This pain started suddenly  immediately after she received news about the sudden death of her close friend.  Slide 5: Clinical Symptoms   Upon presentation  Mrs. K.A. experienced dyspnea  nausea  and anxiety  along with the chest pain. These are common symptoms in TCM.  Slide 6: Conclusion   Emergency assessment and treatment focused on ruling out acute coronary syndrome  given Mrs. K.A.'s age  symptoms  and risk factors. However  further cardiac investigations  including angiogram and echocardiogram  revealed the characteristic 'takotsubo' or 'ballooning' of the left ventricle  leading to a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   Her symptoms improved with supportive care and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers. As TCM is typically a temporary condition  she was advised to avoid severe emotional stress in the future. Further monitoring and rehabilitation would be essential for her recovery.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,51,Title: Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Female Patient  I. Patient Identification and Demographics  The patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian female presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. She is a retired elementary school teacher and a widow with 2 adult children.   II. Chief Complaint  The patient came to the emergency department complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. The symptoms started suddenly  late in the evening  while she was under acute emotional stress following the sudden death of her brother.  III. Past Medical History  Notable aspects of the patient's past medical history include controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  being treated with losartan and rosuvastatin  respectively. She has no history of smoking  diabetes  or illicit drug use. There is no known family history of coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular diseases.   IV. Assessment  Preliminary ECG showed ST-segment depression in the lateral leads  while cardiac enzymes revealed slightly elevated troponin levels. Cardiac catheterization found no significant coronary artery disease  ruling out myocardial infarction.  V. Provisional Diagnosis  Based on her symptoms  electrocardiographic findings  elevated troponin levels  absence of significant coronary artery disease  and recent emotional trauma  the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or ‘broken heart syndrome’.  VI. Conclusion  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy frequently presents in post-menopausal women experiencing emotional stress. Increased awareness and understanding of this condition are crucial for accurate diagnosis and management. While the prognosis for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is often favorable  with appropriate management and reduction of stress  it's essential that care providers rule out acute coronary syndrome and provide appropriate psychological support.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,52,Title: Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Female  Slide 1: Patient Details  Patient: A 68-year-old African-American female Residing: Urban area  Midwest  United States of America Occupation: Retired primary school teacher   Slide 2: Presenting Symptoms  Chief Complaint: •    Chest pain •    Shortness of breath (dyspnea)  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Notable information: •    Non-smoker  moderate alcohol use •    Not on any hormone replacement therapy  •    No history of illicit drug use •    History of controlled hypertension for 8 years •    Absence of significant coronary artery disease  Slide 4: Recent Significant Events  •   Patient has recently been through a severely stressful psychological event: the death of her lifelong partner.  Slide 5: Physical Examination Findings  •   Vital signs: B/P 156/90 mmHg; Pulse 102 bpm; Temp 98.6 F; Resp 22/min;  O2 Saturation 96% on room air. •   Cardiopulmonary examination: Reveals distant heart sounds with an S3 gallop and rales halfway up both lung fields  Slide 6: Preliminary Diagnosis  •    Initial diagnosis indicates possible takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress or broken heart syndrome)  given the clinical picture of severe stress followed by symptoms mimicking an acute coronary syndrome.  Slide 7: Anatomical and Physiological Considerations  •    Typically found in post-menopausal women  takotsubo cardiomyopathy may involve acute left ventricular dysfunction with ballooning of the left ventricular apex during systole. •    Despite resembling a heart attack  takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients usually lack severe coronary artery blockages rather they have sudden onset heart muscle failure.  Slide 8: Summary and Next Steps  Summary: Identification of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is vital since the management and prognosis deviate considerably from those of coronary artery disease.   Next steps for confirmation:  •    Perform echocardiogram •    Conduct coronary angiogram  •    Administer potential treatment options including aspirin  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors and diuretics •    Refer to a cardiologist for further evaluation and ongoing management.  Disclaimer: Personal and clinical details in this presentation are fictional and intended for educational purposes only. The scenario is designed to simulate a case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a demographically appropriate patient  given the known epidemiology of the condition.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,53,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: An Unexpected Cause of Acute Chest Pain  Patient Presentation: We present a case of Mrs. Gertrude Blackwell  an ethnically Caucasian 67-year-old female from a suburban environment. She recently presented at our emergency department complaining of acute onset chest pain radiating to the left arm  associated with shortness of breath.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Blackwell is a retired school teacher with a past medical history notable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both well controlled with medication  and an episode of depression following the loss of her husband two years ago. She has no smoking history  and consumes alcohol moderately. She has no family history of cardio-vascular diseases or sudden cardiac death. Mrs. Blackwell had been in her usual state of health until the start of these symptoms.  Current Presentation: These symptoms were triggered by intense emotional stress  as later revealed that she had been through an armed robbery at her home two nights prior to her presentation to the hospital. The stressor emulates the characteristic trigger of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly referred to as """"broken heart syndrome."""" This condition is often precipitated by acute physical or emotional stress  leading to a sudden temporary weakening of the cardiac muscle.  Demographic Consideration: Women  particularly post-menopausal ones  are more likely to present with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  making Mrs. Blackwell's case consistent with the demographic pool of this condition. Furthermore  Caucasians represent the majority of patients diagnosed with this syndrome.  Conclusion: Taking into account the sudden onset of symptoms  the intense emotional stressor  and demographic predisposition  a very strong differential to consider in Mrs. Blackwell’s case is takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   If confirmed through further diagnostic testing  our treatment approach would largely be symptomatic and focused on addressing the source of the stress. Mrs. Blackwell would likely benefit from cardiology follow up and possible referral for psychological support."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,54,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female who presents with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm along with feelings of extreme stress. She has never smoked and is of moderate socioeconomic status. She mentions the sudden death of her husband a month ago has caused her depression and anxiety.  Her past medical history is significant for hypertension  controlled with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics. She does not have a history of coronary artery disease or any other type of cardiac disease. The patient has no previous psychiatric diagnosis. Family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases in her late parents.   Report from her attending physicians indicated elevated cardiac enzymes with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes suggesting an acute coronary syndrome. However  an angiogram showed no significant coronary artery disease to justify her acute presentation. An echocardiogram revealed a distinctive pattern of significant left ventricular dysfunction  characterized by apical ballooning with preserved contractility of the basal segments. These findings  together with a transient nature  are indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  predominantly observed in postmenopausal women with a preceding emotional stress event.  Therapeutic management is being initiated with supportive care  ongoing surveillance and clinical follow-up. Briefly  due to its resemblance to acute coronary syndrome  her initial treatment entailed aspirin  clopidogrel  and heparin along with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor  and beta-blocker.  In conclusion  our patient represents the typical demographic – postmenopausal woman – diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  usually preceded by an episode of severe emotional distress. As reported in literature  this condition often affects people with a history of neurologic or psychiatric disorders  however  our patient represents a unique case with no such previous history. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,55,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: The patient  Mrs. X  is a 69-year-old Caucasian female. She recently lost her spouse and suffers from severe emotional stress. This stressor  along with her demographic profile  puts her at an increased risk for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  which tends to predominately affect postmenopausal women in their late 60s to early 70s.  Past Medical History: Mrs. X has a history of hypertension  managed by antihypertensive medication. She does not have any known history of coronary artery disease or other heart-related disorders. She has never smoked and only occasionally consumes alcohol. No history of illicit drug use is reported. She is not diabetic  and her lipid profile is normal.  Presentation: Mrs. X presented at the emergency department with severe chest pain  which she described as similar to what she imagines a heart attack would feel like. Accompanying symptoms included shortness of breath and general weakness. The symptoms started soon after she received the news of her husband's tragic death.  On examination  she appeared to be in distress  with an initial blood pressure reading of 150/95 mmHg and her heart rate at 110 beats per minute. On cardiac auscultation  no abnormal heart sounds or murmurs were detected.  Investigations: Given the chest pain  an ECG was performed which showed ST-segment elevation indicative of a possible myocardial infarction. However  in contrast to typical myocardial infarctions  coronary angiography did not reveal any significant occlusion. Blood tests showed transiently elevated cardiac enzymes. An echocardiogram showed a typical pattern of apical ballooning  characteristic of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  This presentation aligns well with literature stating that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy commonly occurs in postmenopausal women and is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. The condition frequently presents like a heart attack and is often only distinguishable by the absence of coronary occlusions and the unique pattern of apical ballooning seen on echocardiograms. Successful management usually involves addressing the underlying stressors and providing supportive care. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,56,"Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 68-year-old  caucasian female by the name of Ms. Adams  who was brought to the hospital with complaints of severe chest pain  mimicking an acute myocardial infarction. This pain had initially started a couple of hours ago  and was described as intense  squeezing chest pain that radiated to her left arm.   Noteworthy is her past medical history  which is significant for hypertension  which she is on appropriate medication for. She also had a history of depression and anxiety  but no personal or family history of heart diseases. Her lifestyle was fairly sedentary with a moderate diet  and she's a non-smoker and doesn't consume alcohol routinely.   Ms. Adams had recently faced the loss of her beloved spouse of 40 years about a week ago. She has been under severe emotional stress coping with it.   This constellation of symptoms in this setting raises a high suspicion for takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or “broken heart syndrome."""" This condition is typically precipitated by a stressful event  like the loss of a loved one and is most common in post-menopausal women.  She will be undergoing further evaluation and management as per the standard protocols for this condition  including echocardiography  coronary angiography  stress testing  blood tests for cardiac enzymes  and other diagnostic investigations as necessary.   Overall  her prognosis will be good with appropriate treatment and care  although in some cases  complications can include severe heart failure and fatal arrhythmias.  Please note that in general populations  the median age of presentation for takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is consistently reported to be between 62 and 75 years. 85-90% of reported cases of TTC are in women  and strong associations have been found between TTC and neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,57,Title: Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:  Ms. Smith  a 67-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department.   Past Medical History:  Ms. Smith has a history of hypertension  known to be adequately controlled on medication. She has never smoked and denies any history of recreational drug use. She lives alone and has been under significant emotional stress recently due to familial issues. She does not have any known allergies. Her cardiovascular risk factors include hypertension and advanced age. She does not present any history of coronary artery disease  and her lipid profile is within normal limits.   Presentation: Ms. Smith presented with sudden-onset  severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. The pain began after a heated argument over the phone with a family member. She also reports feeling short of breath.  Examination: On examination  her heart rate is tachycardic  blood pressure is slightly elevated  and the remainder of her physical examination is within normal limits.   Assessment:  With a recent history of intense emotional stress followed by symptoms of acute chest pain and shortness of breath  the patient's presentation is highly suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly known as 'broken heart syndrome'.   Studies show a higher predominance of takotsubo cardiomyopathy amongst postmenopausal women  typically between the ages of 58-75 years  and Caucasians  which is consistent with our patient's demographics. The disorder often occurs following severe stress  and hypertension is commonly found in these patients. The patient's age  sex  recent emotional stress  and symptoms point towards a high suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Plan:  Further evaluation with EKG  cardiac enzymes  and an echocardiogram is needed to confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed  the management would generally consist of supportive treatment including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and addressing the underlying stressor.   Prognosis:  Most individuals with this condition recover with appropriate medical management  but the condition can occasionally lead to serious complications such as heart failure  arrhythmias  and stroke. Long-term follow-up with a cardiologist is recommended for all patients diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,58,Presentation Title: A Case Study of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman  Patient Profile: The current patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath. She retired two years ago  previously working as a primary school teacher  and she is widowed  with no noted significant drinking or smoking habits. She has two adult children living out of state and has been struggling with feelings of loneliness since her husband’s death a year ago.  Relevant Past Medical History: The patient’s past medical history includes well-managed hypertension  occasional episodes of atrial fibrillation  and moderate osteoarthritis  primarily affecting her hands and knees. She also has a prior history of major depressive disorder but has been in remission for the past six years. It is noted that she was significantly distressed in the past twelve months following the death of her husband.  Presenting Complaints: The patient reported having sudden sharp pain in the chest  centered around the left chest region  which she rated 7 out of 10 on the pain scale. She was noticeably short of breath  a symptom she stated started concurrently with her chest pain. According to her  the pain started about 2 hours before she arrived at the emergency department.   Clinical Presentation: Physical examination revealed tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and a blood pressure reading of 165/95mmHg. She exhibited signs of respiratory distress  including tachypnea. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation  and initial lab results indicated elevated levels of cardiac troponins  suggesting the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome. However  her coronary angiography results were normal  leading us to suspect takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Overview: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress or broken heart syndrome  typically presents in postmenopausal women after a stressful event and mimics symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction. It carries a good prognosis with supportive treatment and stress management. This case highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in differential diagnoses  particular in older  post-menopausal women with acute cardiac symptoms  especially in the context of significant emotional distress or recent life stressors.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,59,Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Female Septuagenarian  Introduction:  I am presenting the case of Ms. Daisy  a 75-year-old Caucasian female who presented with symptoms consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome'.  Patient’s Background: Ms. Daisy lives alone since her husband’s death and has been under considerable stress managing her husband’s estate. She is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. Her past medical history consists of osteoporosis and hypothyroidism. Ms. Daisy has no history of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction.   Presenting Symptoms:  Ms. Daisy presented with sudden  severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The symptoms onset occurred a few hours after she received a letter related to financial matters of her late husband's estate.   Diagnosis: A resting ECG showed mild ST-segment elevation in precordial leads  mimicking an anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  detailed cardiac enzyme assessment did not match the significant myocardial injury observed in acute myocardial infarction. On cardiac echocardiography  there was evidence of apical ballooning in the absence of obstructive coronary disease  which is typical of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Additionally  her clinical scenario of intense emotional stress aligns with the characterization of takotsubo cardiomyopathy being precipitated by acute emotional or physiologic stressors.  Discussion:  The presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in Ms. Daisy fits the typical demographic profile and risk factors as supported by literature. The majority of patients diagnosed are post-menopausal women  and stress is often the catalyst for the onset of symptoms. While the syndrome can mimic acute coronary syndrome  the absence of blocked coronary arteries distinguishes takotsubo. The prognosis is usually favorable with appropriate management and follow-up.  Conclusion: Understanding the demographics  typical presenting features  and triggers can aid in the quick recognition of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  correct diagnosis  and appropriate management. It is also crucial to have awareness about the psychological aspects of this syndrome  so patients like Ms. Daisy can be given the necessary emotional support and therapy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,60,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mrs. X Age: 68 years old Sex: Female Race: Asian (Japanese descent) Occupation: Retired school teacher  Presenting Symptoms: Mrs. X came to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain. The chest pain was sudden in onset and felt like 'a heavy object was pressing down on the chest.' The pain was not radiating and aggravated by emotional stress. She also reported feeling significant fatigue and shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: Mrs. X has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed by medication (Lisinopril for hypertension  and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia). She has no history of heart disease or diabetes. Her family history is remarkable for heart disease in her father who had his first heart attack at the age of 50.  Lifestyle: Mrs. X has a smoking history of 20 years  though she quit smoking about a decade ago. She drinks occasionally and maintains a moderately healthy diet. She recently lost her spouse and has been living by herself.  Discussion: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or  informally  'broken heart syndrome ' is a condition where the heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or stunned. The left ventricle  one of the heart's chambers  changes shape due to this  which affects the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. It predominantly affects post-menopausal women and is often precipitated by severe emotional stress. In Mrs. X's case  the recent loss of her spouse could have been a trigger. The chest pain and shortness of breath she is experiencing are typical symptoms and can easily be mistaken for a heart attack. Prompt diagnosis and management are crucial for the patient's recovery.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,61,Title: Status Presentation – Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: Presented to the department is Mrs. Rosalind  68-year-old Caucasian female from a suburban neighborhood  hailing from a middle-income socioeconomic background. She is a retired school teacher  lives with her husband and maintains average lifestyle habits.  Chief Complaint: Mrs. Rosalind presents with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath occurring over the past couple of days. She has described the pain as 'severe and heavy'  located in the center of her chest and not radiating anywhere.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Rosalind has a history of hypertension which has been controlled with lisinopril. There is no past documentation of ischemic heart disease  valvular heart disease  or cardiomyopathies prior to this incident. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol excessively.  Past Family History: A pertinent family history includes her father who died at the age of 60 due to complications from atherosclerotic heart disease. Her mother is alive and has a history of skeletal muscle weakness  but no known cardiovascular disease.  Recent Stressors: She experienced significant stress earlier in the week from the passing of a close friend. Mrs. Rosalind reports that this loss has resulted in emotional stress and disrupted sleep patterns. She has no history of mental health conditions or treatment.  Demographic Representation: Literature on Takotsubo cardiomyopathy reveals that it often occurs in postmenopausal women and can be triggered by severe emotional or physical stress. Furthermore  Caucasian women seem to be particularly predisposed to the condition. Therefore  our patient's presentation and demographic background align with findings in literature.  In conclusion  Mrs. Rosalind is a typical patient presenting with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Understanding her demographic identity and lifestyle habits can significantly contribute to forming an effective treatment plan and predicting the prognosis of her condition.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,62,Patient Presentation:  Patient M.R. is a 76-year-old Caucasian woman who is seeking medical intervention complaining of severe  unexplained chest pain  shortness of breath  and fatigue. She rates her chest pain as '8' on a scale of 0-10. The onset of these symptoms occurred a few days ago and has progressively worsened.  Demographic Information:  Mrs. M.R. is a retired school teacher. She lost her husband last year  which was a major life stressor for her. Her living conditions involve living alone in her family home. Mrs. M.R. is a nonsmoker and occasionally consumes alcohol. She has never engaged in illegal substance usage.  Past Medical History:  She has a history of hypertension for which she is on medication. Her family history is significant for coronary artery disease and high cholesterol levels  although Mrs. M.R. herself has been known to maintain a healthy cholesterol profile.  Relevant studies have shown that around 90% of reported cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  otherwise known as “broken-heart syndrome”  are in women aged 58-75. This condition is commonly triggered by severe emotional or physical stress. Mrs. M.R.’s symptoms  age  sex  and recent emotional trauma warrant consideration of takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis.   It is also important  however  to remember that these symptoms can be indicative of multiple heart diseases including acute coronary syndromes. Therefore  comprehensive workup inclusive of blood tests  EKG  and potentially advanced cardiac imaging will be necessary to arrive at a definitive diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,63,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy     Demographics: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian female  retired  widowed with two adult children and residing in urban areas of the East Coast of the United States. The patient is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol only in moderation.   Past Medical History: She has a documented history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. She underwent menopause at the age of 52. She does not have any history of myocardial infarction  stroke  diabetes  or other chronic illnesses. She has been maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular cardiovascular exercises. Her prescribed medications include a beta-blocker and a statin.   Presenting Complaint:  She came to the emergency department presenting with severe chest pain and shortness of breath  which occurred suddenly just after she received news of her brother's unexpected death. The pain has been described as severe  similar to a heart attack. Accompanying symptoms include mild nausea  sweating  and palpitations.   Background: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome  usually affects postmenopausal women and often presents after a stressful event. It mimics myocardial infarction symptoms but lacks the obstructive coronary disease usually associated. The condition usually has good prognosis with proper management and support. It has a strong association with emotional or physical stressors and is believed to be due to an intense surge of stress hormones.   This demographic and clinical presentation is typical for takotsubo cardiomyopathy based on the existing literature. Female gender  particularly postmenopausal women  are more prone to this condition. Also  emotional stressors are commonly associated triggers.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,64,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian female  a retiree  named Margaret. She resides in an urban setting in the Midwest  is widowed  and lives alone. She has 2 adult children.  Medical History:  Margaret has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both controlled with medications (lisinopril and atorvastatin  respectively). She is also a former smoker  having quit twenty years prior  and has a history of mild alcohol use  mainly socially. Other than that  her medical history is fairly unremarkable with no previous episodes of heart disease  diabetes or chronic lung disease.   Recent Health Events: Margaret recently underwent a hip replacement surgery and was recovering well. However  two weeks postoperative  she had a sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. This was subsequently followed by lightheadedness  sweating  and nausea.  Physical Examination and Laboratory Findings: Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 150/95 mm Hg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. An EKG demonstrated ST-segment elevation and slightly elevated Troponin levels. An echocardiogram revealed abnormal left ventricular function with apical ballooning  suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or broken heart syndrome  is a transient heart condition often triggered by severe physical or emotional stress. Surgeries  as in Margaret’s case  are one of the potential triggers. This condition is more common in postmenopausal women and those with a history of a neurological or psychiatric disorders. While the patient's demographic information and history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia are generally consistent with the population most affected by this condition  she does not have a known neurological or psychiatric disorder that might also predispose her.  The typical presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy mimics that of an acute coronary syndrome with chest pain  shortness of breath  nausea  and sweating  as in Margaret’s case. EKG changes and cardiac biomarker elevations are also typical as seen in our patient  and echocardiography characteristically shows apical ballooning of the left ventricle. Treatment is generally supportive  and the prognosis overall is favourable with the majority of patients experiencing complete resolution of cardiac dysfunction within weeks or months.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,65,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Presentation   Slide 1: Introduction Our patient today is Mrs. A  a 68-year-old Caucasian female from Midwest United States. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy predominantly affects post-menopausal women and is more prevalent among Caucasian women.  Slide 2: History  Mrs. A's medical history reveals that she suffers from chronic anxiety and recently experienced a significant life stressor: the death of her husband. It's noted that emotional stress is a common trigger for takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Slide 3: Symptoms  She presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She reported that these symptoms starting suddenly in a matter of minutes.   Slide 4: Physical Examination  Upon physical examination  Mrs. A shows signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure is slightly elevated at 145/85 mmHg. Her breathing is slightly labored.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Tests  Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed abnormal T-wave patterns and possible mild ST-segment elevation  which led to the initial suspicion of an acute myocardial infarction. However  cardiac biomarkers  although elevated  were disproportionally low in comparison to the significant symptoms she was experiencing.   Slide 6: Further Examination  Cardiac angiography was conducted and surprisingly  no obstructive coronary artery disease was found  even though the apical segments of the left ventricle were not contracting properly (apical ballooning)  which is characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Conclusion  Consequently  Mrs. A was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  primarily based on the mismatch between the clinical presentation and the angiography findings  along with her significant emotional stressor. She was admitted for close monitoring and supportive treatment.  Slide 8: Treatment and Follow-up Treatment included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and for her  given her history of anxiety  provision of psychological support. Mrs. A showed considerable improvement at her one-month follow-up. Her ECG returned to normal and her echocardiogram showed complete resolution of left ventricular dysfunction. She was also referred to a psychologist to help manage her anxiety and grief.   Slide 9: Take Home Message  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  while mimicking a heart attack  is a completely different entity often precipitated by severe stress. It is reversible with appropriate treatment and management of the underlying emotional triggers.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,66,"Title: Presentation on a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: Age: 72 years old Sex: Female  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired  Residence: Urban area  Presenting Condition: Our subject is a 72-year-old Caucasian woman presenting symptoms consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome."""" These symptoms include severe chest pain and shortness of breath  which began unexpectedly after receiving devastating news about the death of an immediate family member.  Past Medical History: Documented risk factors include a previous history of neurologic disorders  notably a minor cerebrovascular accident (stroke) 7 years ago. She also has a history of psychiatric illnesses  particularly years-long persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia).  The patient is a non-smoker and enjoys a modest intake of alcohol. She has a BMI within the normal range  and a balanced diet. Her past medical history reveals hypertension  but no previous signs of heart diseases such as myocardial infarction  angina  or congestive heart failure.    It's noteworthy that takotsubo cardiomyopathy is highly prevalent in post-menopausal women like our patient. The common triggers are intense emotional or physical stress  which she has also experienced recently.  Family Medical History: Reports show that her family medical history is positive for cardiovascular diseases. Her father suffered from myocardial infarction at the age of 62 and an elder sibling has a medical history of angina.  Conclusion: This case study represents an accurate demographic representation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in line with what is commonly seen in medical literature. According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders  takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurs almost predominantly in postmenopausal women  typically between 58 and 75 years of age  which matches our patient’s demographic. Precipitating emotional or physical stress events can trigger this condition  leading to temporary heart muscle failure resembling a heart attack."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,67,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian female presenting with sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and lightheadedness. She is accompanied by her daughter who reports that the symptoms started approximately two hours ago during a particularly stressful family event.   Demographics:  Our patient is a member of the demographic group most commonly affected by takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome. This condition tends to frequently affect post-menopausal women in their late sixties to early seventies and is often precipitated by extreme emotional or physical stress. Caucasian patients seem to be the most predominantly affected  according to available literature.  Past Medical History:  Previously  she was generally in good health with a medical history of controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which she takes amlodipine and atorvastatin  respectively. She has no other chronic illnesses nor history of surgeries. There is no known history of cardiac problems or arrhythmias. However  it should be noted that she experienced a recent loss of a close family member  leading to significant emotional stress.  Presentation Symptoms:  Her primary symptoms include sudden chest pain and shortness of breath  both classic symptoms often seen in patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Other symptoms  such as palpitations  lightheadedness  and fainting  can also be present sometimes. As the syndrome often mimics symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome  it was initially suspected that the patient was experiencing an acute myocardial infarction. However  the context of severe stress preceding symptom onset suggests a potential diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Further investigation  including cardiac imaging  is required to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of these symptoms.   Treatment typically includes heart failure medications  with the majority of patients experiencing a full recovery with appropriate management. It will also be important to explore stress management strategies with this patient to prevent recurrence of this condition.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,68,Slide 1: Introduction  Patient X is a 69-year-old Postmenopausal Caucasian woman presenting for evaluation of chest pain and difficulty breathing. She is from a middle-class socioeconomic background  residing in urban region  living with her retired partner.   Slide 2: Demographics Breakdown  Statistically  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is most commonly seen in postmenopausal women with a median age of 67 years. The racial and ethnic distribution is variable  but it is predominantly reported in Caucasians within the United States. Approximately 90% of reported cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy occur in women.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Patient X has a diagnosis of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  controlled with medication. She has a smoking history of 20 pack-years but quit 15 years ago. She does not have a personal or family history of coronary artery disease. She also has a history of generalized anxiety disorder.  Slide 4: Recent Life Events  In the past month  Patient X experienced the loss of her sister  to which she was significantly close. Major stressful events often precede symptoms of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 5: Clinical Presentation  The patient was brought to the Emergency Department with sudden onset chest discomfort  difficulty breathing  increased sweating  and mild confusion. These symptoms started a few hours before her arrival. The chest pain was reported as severe  radiating to the left arm  worsening with exertion.   Slide 6: Differential Diagnosis   Given the nature of her symptoms  the immediate clinical consideration is an acute coronary syndrome induced by a large stressor. However  given the patient’s demographics  clinical presentation  and recent life events  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome) will also be explored.  Accurate diagnosis and management can significantly reduce the risk of complications  such as heart failure  arrhythmias  and even death in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Slide 7: Conclusion  Taking into account Patient X's gender  age  personal medical history  recent stressful life event  and clinical presentation  it's essential to consider Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis to provide the correct therapeutic approach and improve her prognosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,69,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Case Presentation  Patient Profile: - Age: 69 years old - Sex: Female - Ethnicity: White - Occupation: Retired school teacher  History: Our patient  a 69-year-old White female has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both under good control with medications. She takes hydrochlorothiazide for her hypertension and atorvastatin for her elevated cholesterol levels. The patient does not smoke cigarettes  uses alcohol moderately  and does not use illicit drugs. She has no known allergies. For the past 5 years  she has been living a relatively sedentary lifestyle post-retirement from her teaching profession. There is a family history of coronary artery disease with her mother passing away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 75.  Presenting Complaints: She was brought to the emergency department presenting with severe chest pain and shortness of breath  which started suddenly after hearing about the unexpected death of a close friend. The pain was located in the center of her chest and was described as a heavy  crushing pain that did not radiate. The severity has been constant since onset  and rated as 8/10 in intensity.  Examination and vitals: On examination  she appears anxious. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 155/90 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  temperature 36.8°C  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. The cardiac examination reveals tachycardia but no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.   Given her symptoms and past medical history  clinical suspicion for takotsubo cardiomyopathy was raised. This condition is commonly seen in postmenopausal women and is often triggered by a period of intense emotional or physical stress  like the unexpected loss of her friend.  (Medical data and clinical history of this fictive patient are created for a case representation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy which is most prevalent in postmenopausal women  it does not represent a real-life situation).
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,70,Subject Profile:  Patient’s Name: [REDACTED] Age: 68 years old Sex: Female Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Residence: Urban  Marital Status: Widowed   Presenting Complaint:  The patient presents with acute chest pain and shortness of breath following the death of her husband three weeks ago.  Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In addition  she was previously diagnosed with anxiety and depression. She was treated for breast cancer twenty years ago but has been disease free since that time. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.   Current Medications:  1. Amlodipine for hypertension 2. Simvastatin for hyperlipidemia 3. Sertraline for Anxiety/Depression  Clinical Findings on Examination: Chest examination revealed tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and elevated blood pressure. An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation. Cardiac biomarkers  including troponin  were elevated. A subsequent echocardiogram showed systolic dysfunction  particularly left ventricular apical ballooning  indicative of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as broken heart syndrome.  Summary:  This profile represents a typical patient diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  a condition that mimics myocardial infarction and is often triggered by acute emotional stress. TCM is more common in postmenopausal women and those with a history of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. This highlights the importance of taking a full psychosocial history in patients presenting with signs of cardiac distress  particularly in those who do not have significant risk factors for coronary artery disease. Treatment generally involves supportive care  with resolution of symptoms typically occurring in weeks to months.   References:   1. Ghadri  J. R.  Wittstein  I. S.  Prasad  A.  Sharkey  S.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,71,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile:  Our patient is a 68-year old Caucasian female  Mrs. Anderson  who lives in a suburban neighborhood. She is a retired teacher and widow with three adult children. She has a history of hypertension and is on blood pressure medication. However  she does not have any known history of cardiovascular disease.  Recent Medical History:  Two days prior to the presentation  Mrs. Anderson experienced a severe emotional upset following the sudden death of her pet dog. Initially  she had mild chest discomfort but neglected it as heartburn. But  the discomfort progressed and it soon turned into chest pain.  Clinical Presentation:  Upon arrival  Mrs. Anderson complained of acute chest pain radiating to the left arm  and shortness of breath  symptoms mimicking an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). On examination  her blood pressure was 170/90 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  and respiratory rate 20 per minute. An ECG showed ST segment elevation  and an echocardiogram showed mid and apical left ventricular ballooning but preservation at the base.  Diagnosis and Potential Challenges:  The diagnosis for Mrs. Anderson is Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'. This condition is specifically challenging to diagnose as it mimics heart attack symptoms. In her case  this diagnosis was confirmed upon finding normal coronary arteries (no evidence of atherosclerotic heart disease) on angiography and because of a precipitating emotional stressor.   Epidemiology:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy most commonly affects postmenopausal women. The mean age of presentation is 66-75 years old. TCM accounts for 1-2% of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome symptoms like those resembling a heart attack. It is often precipitated by either physical or emotional extreme stress events.   Concluding note:  Lastly  it is essential to understand that TCM can be life-threatening  despite its common portrayal as a less severe disease. Therefore  early recognition  proper diagnosis  immediate management  and educating patients about potential psychological stress management is vital.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,72,Subject Overview:   This is a presentation of a 68-year-old Caucasian woman with a medical history significant for hypertension and generalized anxiety disorder who has been recently diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   Details:  Our patient is a retired school teacher who lives alone  enjoys gardening  and is often concerned about her health. She has a 30-year history of hypertension that is currently managed with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. She has been undergoing treatment for generalized anxiety disorder for the past 10 years with sertraline.   Presenting Issue:  Our patient presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of sharp  severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath and a feeling of impending doom. The episode occurred immediately following a telephonic conversation arguing with her insurance service provider over a policy denial. Her EKG revealed ST-segment elevation in anterior leads  leading to a preliminary diagnosis of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. However  coronary angiography was normal and left ventricular angiography indicated apical ballooning with basal sparing  leading to a final diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  or “Broken Heart Syndrome.”  Demographics and TCM:  This presentation aligns with the typical demographic and presentation for TCM: It is most commonly seen in postmenopausal females with a mean age of 58-75 years  and often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. TCM is more common in patients with a history of neurologic or psychiatric illness  such as our patient’s generalized anxiety disorder. Caucasian populations are more commonly affected  yet it is a global phenomenon.   Concluding Remarks:  Our patient’s diagnosis and management of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is underway. She is being treated with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and careful monitoring. Embedded in her care is education regarding stress management  the importance of maintaining her mental health  and understanding the unique link between her emotional triggers and cardiac health.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,73,Title: Case Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  a retiree from a career in teaching. She is originally from New York City but now resides in a suburb of New Jersey.  Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which she manages with medication. She has no past incidences of coronary artery disease or any previously documented heart problems. She smokes socially and has a body mass index (BMI) of 29  which classifies her as overweight. Her family history also includes cardiovascular diseases  with both her parents dying due to myocardial infarction.   Presenting Symptoms: This patient was brought in following an emergency call for sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and a feeling of impending doom evidence of severe anxiety. The symptoms occurred in an acute fashion while she was dealing with intense stress due to the unexpected death of her sister.  Diagnostic Findings: An initial examination revealed tachycardia and normal blood pressure. An EGC confirmed ST-segment changes  but a subsequent angiogram indicated no obstructive coronary artery disease. An echo confirmed left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning  consistent with a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Troponin levels were also elevated  further indicating myocardial injury. Thyroid and adrenal function were within normal limits.   Conclusion: Taken together  this patient's demographic details  history  and presenting symptoms follow a typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often called broken heart syndrome. Her gender  age  the presence of a significant stressor  and absence of significative coronary artery disease are all consistent with the syndrome. Patients like her  commonly postmenopausal women may exhibit signs and symptoms mimicking an acute coronary syndrome during a particularly stressful event. Thus  a comprehensive approach is required to correctly diagnose and manage these patients. An individual care plan will be constructed to address her medical needs and reduce the risk of recurrence.   Future considerations for this patient involve stress management and cardiac rehabilitation  as well as ongoing management of her hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,74,Title: Case Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information: Ms. Joan  a 68-year old post-menopausal Caucasian woman from the United States  presents with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. A retired school teacher  she is a non-smoker and has a BMI within normal range. She comes from a low-stress lifestyle and does not have a family history of heart-related illnesses or any history of substance abuse.  Past Medical History: Up until now  Ms. Joan has been in good health with no history of chest pain or acute coronary syndrome. She suffers from hypertension  for which she has been taking oral antihypertensives for the past decade. She is also diagnosed with stage 2 chronic kidney disease.   Clinical Presentation: Ms. Joan presented at the ER complaining of a sudden onset of severe chest pain characterized as crushing in nature  reminiscent of a heart attack. The severe chest discomfort started unexpectedly after she received news of her daughter’s serious automobile accident. She also reported experiencing mild shortness of breath.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  Ms. Joan appeared anxious and in visible discomfort. Her vital signs were recorded as follows: blood pressure of 153/90 mmHg  heart rate at 102 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute  and normal body temperature.  Final notes: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often referred to as broken-heart syndrome  is more frequently observed in postmenopausal women and often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress. Thus  demographic factors such as gender and age play a crucial role in this presentation. Its management involves supportive care and treating underlying triggers.   Ms. Joan's case falls in line with the typical demographic most affected by this condition. Her condition further emphasizes the need for health care providers to examine potentially unrelated emotional and psychological factors when evaluating patients for heart-related symptoms.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,75,Title: A Case Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female presenting with symptoms suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. Patient states she experienced a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating down her left arm at home. She blinked  describing the pain as pressing and gives it an 8/10 on the pain scale. She also indicates experiencing associated shortness of breath  light-headedness  and an overwhelming sense of anxiety. The precipitating event appears to be a significant emotional stressor related to the sudden death of her husband two weeks prior.  Past Medical History:  Her past medical history includes hypertension controlled with lisinopril and type 2 diabetes managed with metformin. There is no known history of smoking  alcohol or illicit drug use. She lives alone and has no children. She retired 3 years ago after a career as a high school teacher. Before this event  she led a relatively active and independent lifestyle with regular walking as her daily exercise.  Her mother died of myocardial infarction at age 77 and her father had a stroke at age 82.  Clinical Evaluation:  Preliminary examination reveals an anxious patient in acute distress. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  a heart rate of 110 bpm  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Cardiovascular examination indicates tachycardia without murmurs  and her lungs are clear to auscultation. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in anterior leads. Initial lab tests noted mildly elevated troponin levels.  Diagnosis:  Given the patient's clinical presentation  ECG changes  and mildly elevated cardiac enzymes  the tentative diagnosis is takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome'. Confirmatory diagnosis would require a coronary angiogram excluding obstructive coronary artery disease and an echocardiogram demonstrating a characteristic pattern of apical ballooning.  Treatment Plan:  The primary treatment is supportive  focusing on symptom relief and beta-blockers to reduce elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme or receptor blockers may be considered if the patient can tolerate. The patient's psychological status must also be addressed: referral for grief counseling or psychiatric consultation may be considered. Progressive  monitored cardiovascular rehabilitation should follow an initial period of rest.  Prognosis:  Most patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy recover left ventricular function within days to weeks although the overall mortality rate is comparable to that in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Stress reduction and management are crucial for long-term prognosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,76,Title: Case Presentation: A Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Introduction: This case report presents a patient with cardiomyopathy  specifically  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome. This condition typically manifests in postmenopausal women and is often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress.  Demographic Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female residing in an urban setting within New York City. She lives alone and recently retired as a secondary school teacher. She is a non-smoker. Her dietary patterns have been fluctuating  with little consumption of fruits and vegetables. She has a glass or two of wine on weekends. She remains relatively active socially but has been experiencing stress and anxiety due to the recent sudden loss of her husband.  Medical History: The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension for which she has been on antihypertensive medication for the last 10-years. The patient also has a history of anxiety disorder and is intermittently compliant with prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). There's no recorded history of diabetes  cardiac disease  or hyperlipidemia. No known allergies are recorded.  Presenting Problem: Her current episode arose following the sudden death of her husband. She presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. Initial suspicion was an acute myocardial infarction due to the typical chest pain and changes in her electrocardiogram. However  the coronary angiography was normal  leading to a tentative diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy based on symptoms and recent emotional stress.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a transient cardiac syndrome  imitates an acute coronary syndrome and often occurs in postmenopausal women following physical or emotional stress. This case is classic in that a rather healthy elderly female experienced severe stress and presented with chest pain suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. The normal coronary angiogram veered the diagnosis towards Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Recommended Management: The patient was admitted and managed conservatively with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Careful monitoring of cardiac function with regular echocardiography is necessary  and she should not discontinue her medication abruptly. Psychotherapy and SSRI treatment should be optimized given the significant stressor and her history of anxiety.  Conclusion: Our patient's presentation underscores that significant emotional stress can trigger Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in susceptible individuals. Prompt recognition and appropriate management are crucial to prevent complications  and psychiatric intervention is often warranted due to its strong association with stress and mental health conditions.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,77,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman  Presentation:  Today we will discuss the case of Mrs. Amanda Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian woman from Denver  Colorado  who has been diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly referred to as Broken Heart Syndrome.   Mrs. Smith is a retired school teacher  non-smoker  and maintains a moderate alcohol intake. She leads a relatively active lifestyle and follows a balanced nutrition plan  but she has a family history of cardiovascular disease with both her parents dying in their early seventies from heart-related complications.  In terms of past medical history  Mrs. Smith has controlled hypertension and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago  for which she takes metformin. She has also been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following the death of her husband three years ago and receives psychotherapy treatment for this condition.  Mrs. Smith presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  similar to a myocardial infarction  with acute onset during a moment of intense emotional distress. Her electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation  which is indicative of a possible heart attack. However  coronary angiography revealed no significant occlusions  which is standard for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Upon echocardiography  the classic appearance of apical ballooning of the left ventricle - a sign of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy - was noted.  It's significant to note that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy tends to occur more frequently in postmenopausal women and can often be triggered by emotional or physical stress. In this case  our patient’s intense emotional distress coupled with her history of PTSD likely served as the trigger for her condition. While its precise pathophysiology remains unclear  intense sympathetic stimulation seems to play a key role.  Mrs. Smith's case offers an important reminder: while Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can mimic symptoms of a heart attack  there are distinguishing factors such as the absence of notably obstructed coronary arteries and the specific 'ballooning' deformation of the left ventricle. Given her age  sex  post-menopausal status  and predisposing stress factors  Mrs. Smith accurately represents the demographic with the highest incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Key steps to deliver appropriate treatment and care for such patients include fast diagnosis  management of immediate symptoms  and monitoring for complications.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,78,"Title: Presentation of A Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Name: Mrs. Susan Wright Age: 68 years Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired nurse  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Wright was brought to the emergency department by her daughter. She complained of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that began after hearing about the sudden death of her close friend. She describes the pain as sharp and radiating to the left shoulder.  Past Medical History: Significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which has been managed with medication for the last fifteen years. She underwent a hysterectomy 10 years ago for fibroids but has no history of any other surgical intervention. Mrs. Wright quit smoking approximately 20 years ago  reports occasional social alcohol use  and denies any illicit drug use. There's no known family history of heart diseases  and she is up-to-date with her age-appropriate screenings.  Present Examination: On examination  she appears anxious but not in any acute respiratory distress. Vitals show that she is tachycardic with a heart rate of 106 beats per minute  blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The chest examination reveals normal vesicular breath sounds with no added sounds. Cardiovascular examination shows mild tachycardia but no murmurs or rubs.  Based on the match in clinical presentation  female sex  post-menopausal status  and substantial emotional stress event with the demographics and triggers typically associated with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""")  suspicion for this condition is high. Mrs. Wright will be starting supportive treatment while undergoing further diagnostic tests  including an ECG  blood tests  echo  and possibly coronary angiography  to confirm the diagnosis and rule out acute coronary syndrome.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  primarily affects post-menopausal women and can present similarly to an acute coronary syndrome. As one review in the journal Circulation highlighted  up to 90% of reported cases are in women aged 58 to 75. Stressful events often precede the symptoms  and patients commonly present with chest pain and dyspnea  as in Mrs. Wright's case.  Cultural Considerations: Healthcare professionals need to be aware that while TTC can occur in any demographic  it predominantly affects post-menopausal women. Literature supports the idea that sudden emotional stress can trigger TTC  which could make some people  especially those from cultures that suppress emotional expression  more susceptible to this condition. Consistent with patient-centered care  understanding the cultural context may aid in diagnosis and treatment.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,79,"Title: A Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient's Identifying Information: We are presenting a 68-year-old Caucasian female of non-Hispanic ethnicity.  Chief Complaint: The patient presents with severe chest pain and shortness of breath occurring at rest  and a recent history of emotional distress following the sudden loss of a loved one.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  for which she is on antihypertensive medication. She also has a history of anxiety and had been previously diagnosed with depression.   Background and Demographics: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome """" predominantly affects post-menopausal women. According to the literature  it has been found to be more prevalent in Caucasian females with an average age of presentation of 67-70. This condition is triggered by stressful situations  both physical and emotional. Our patient is representative of the typical demographic affected by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Presentation: Reviewing the patient's symptoms  which mimic those of a heart attack  including chest pain  breathlessness  and associated symptoms such as palpitations  is crucial. However  unlike myocardial infarction  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy does not show blocked coronary arteries on angiography. The condition is generally reversible and the prognosis is usually excellent  however  it can sometimes lead to serious complications like heart failure.  Risk Factors: Well-established risk factors include a history of neuropsychiatric disorders  including mood disorders  such as depression and anxiety  which our patient has a past history of. Also  stress-triggering situations  such as sudden emotional distress caused by the untimely demise of a loved one in our patient's case  are among the most frequently reported triggers of the disease.  To sum up  our patient's demographic  clinical history  and recent stressor events align with those typically seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,80,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Identification: Ms. Jane Doe is a 70-year-old Caucasian female who presents to our clinical setting today with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath since two days.   Demographic Details: Ms. Doe is a retiree  a widower for 5 years  and lives by herself in suburban Massachusetts. She has two grown-up children who live out-of-state.  Past Medical History: Ms. Doe has a known history of well-controlled hypertension for the past 10 years and osteoporosis diagnosed 2 years ago. She does not report any history of coronary artery disease  diabetes mellitus  or other heart disorders. She has never smoked or used alcohol excessively.   Presenting Complaint: She experienced a sudden chest pain and alarming shortness of breath two days ago  while learning about the sudden death of her close friend. The pain was intense  radiating to her left arm and associated with profuse sweating. She also reports feeling light-headed and nauseated at that time.  Summary: Studies suggest that post-menopausal women  especially those in their 70s  are more likely to get Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome. The onset is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress  as is the case with Ms. Doe. The disparity between the patient's clinical presentation and her medical history  along with the emotional trauma she experienced  strongly point toward Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Immediate thorough clinical evaluation  involving cardiac imaging and possibly coronary angiography  would be critical to confirming the diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment.  
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,81,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Case Study Presentation  Patient Profile:  Ms. Mary  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presented herself to the emergency department. She recently retired from a job as a professional executive assistant and lives alone in a suburban neighborhood.   Chief Complaint: Mary reported an abrupt onset of severe chest pain radiating towards her left arm. This is the first such episode she's experienced. Recollecting the incidents  she also revealed that she had lost a close family relative a week ago and has been under extreme emotional stress ever since.  Clinical History: Her past medical history includes only hypertension  which has been controlled with the antihypertensive medication  Losartan  for the past decade. She denied any history of ischemic heart disease  diabetes  or smoking. She has no known drug allergies.   Family History: Family medical history shows that her father died due to a heart attack at the age of 72  but her mother  aged 90  is at present quite healthy. She currently has two siblings  both of which are free from cardiovascular disease.  Current Physical Condition: Visual inspection shows no sign of physical distress. Her blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg  pulse is 88 bpm  regular and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Her O2 saturation level is 96% in room air.   Literature Adjunct: Our patient profile aligns with the common demographic of the Takotsubo cardiomyopathy cases found in the literature  where the majority are postmenopausal women over the age of 50  commonly triggered by a physical or emotional stressor. As per the American Heart Association  takotsubo cardiomyopathy affects up to 5% of women evaluated for suspected myocardial infarction  and the mean age of patients is 67.  Conclusion: The demographic and clinical presentation of the patient indicates a suspected case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Further diagnostic evaluation including echocardiogram and coronary angiogram will be essential to confirm the diagnosis and begin early management. Proper social support and psychological care are also necessary considering the emotional stressor in the background.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,82,Title: Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Introduction:  Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath. She lives alone  recently retired from her job as a school teacher  and has been experiencing severe emotional stress due to the recent death of her husband. She is a non-smoker  consumes moderate alcohol  and refers to herself as moderately sedentary.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia that she has been managing for the past ten years with prescribed medications. She also has a history of major depressive disorder for which she had been on escitalopram for several years and has been off medication for the past two years. She has no known allergies and no documented history of cardiovascular disease or cardiac events.   Presenting Symptoms:   The patient stated that the chest pain started abruptly within the last 24 hours and is described as a squeezing sensation which radiates to her left arm and jaw. It's associated with shortness of breath  nausea  and lightheadedness. She states no symptoms of fever  cough  or other associated infectious symptoms and her symptoms do not improve with rest.  Physical Exam Findings:  On examination  her BP was 155/90 mmHg; Pulse  110 bpm; oxygen saturation  91% on ambient air; and there were no significant findings on auscultation. The rest of the physical examination including neurological were within normal limits.  How the Case Relates to Epidemiological Data:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a type of non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy most commonly seen in post-menopausal women. It is frequently triggered by acute physical or emotional stressors. This patient being post-menopausal and recently experiencing emotional stress fits the demographic pattern.  Summary:  Based on the patient's presentation and demographic  she is a prime candidate for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which will be confirmed with further laboratory and imaging studies. Comprehensive evaluation  management  and follow-up will be required due to the acute nature of this condition and to prevent any serious complications.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,83,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman  Patient Presentation:   Our patient  Mrs. X  is a 66-year-old Caucasian female presenting with chest pain and dyspnea on exertion for the past two days. Mrs. X came to the emergency department (ED) reporting a sudden onset of severe chest pain after receiving news of her husband's death.   Past Medical History:   Mrs. X has a history of hypertension  for which she has been on hydrochlorothiazide for the past ten years. She does not smoke  consume alcohol  or use illicit drugs. She is post-menopausal and does not have a known history of ischemic heart disease. Her family history reveals a sister with breast cancer and a father with myocardial infarction.   Clinical Assessment:  In consideration of her sudden onset chest pain following an emotional stressor  a primary concern is Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome."""" This condition is often triggered by severe emotional stress and presents with symptoms resembling an acute coronary syndrome.   Demographically  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more common in post-menopausal women  typically between the ages of 50 and 70. The majority being Caucasian  and typically have a history of hypertension  making Mrs. X a relatively typical takotsubo patient.   Mrs. X’s symptoms  age  gender  and the nature of her stress trigger make Takotsubo cardiomyopathy a potential diagnosis. Further investigations with an electrocardiogram (ECG)  blood tests for troponin levels  and echocardiogram  or possibly cardiac catheterization  will need to be carried out to confirm the diagnosis.   Overall  Mrs. X will need prompt evaluation and a comprehensive approach to her management that takes into account her physical and emotional wellbeing. Future care should involve monitoring and treatment for her hypertension and potential use of stress management techniques or psychiatric intervention to address her emotional stressors."

Presenting Complaints:   She has come into the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain mimicking a heart attack. Her ECG revealed unusual patterns and laboratory tests showed slightly elevated cardiac enzymes. Echocardiogram findings were congruent with diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome.  This patient presentation exemplifies the typical demographic for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: elderly  Caucasian women with a history of hypertension and significant recent emotional stress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,85,"Presentation Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Introduction:  Today  we will discuss a patient with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced or """"broken heart"""" syndrome. This condition  generally temporary  causes the left ventricle of the heart to dilate  impairing its pumping ability.   Demographics:  Our patient is a 71-year-old Caucasian female. According to a study by Sattar et al. in 2016  about 90% of reported cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy occur in women aged 58-75. The trend towards older  post-menopausal women reflects hormonal changes that may reduce myocardial resistance to stress.  Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both well-controlled with medication. She has no history of coronary artery disease or any other heart conditions. She recently lost her husband  and since then has been reporting feelings of intense grief  further emphasizing the connection between extreme emotional stress events and the occurrence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She's a nonsmoker and does not drink alcohol.  Recent Incidence:  The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ST-segment elevation  which typically signals a myocardial infarction. However  a coronary angiogram showed no significant coronary artery disease that would account for her symptoms.   Diagnosis & Progress:  Based on these findings  ventriculography was performed  showing an apical ballooning pattern and reduced ejection fraction. These results  along with her recent emotional stress  led to a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   The patient was managed conservatively with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers and was offered counselling to manage grief. On follow-up after three months  the patient's symptoms had resolved completely  and an echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function  which is consistent with the often temporary nature of this condition.  Conclusion:  This case demonstrates the essential role of integrating clinical symptoms  history and diagnostic imaging in identifying Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  particularly when the patient's presentation may initially suggest acute coronary syndrome. It underscores the significant impact of emotional stress on cardiovascular health and the need for emotional support and psychological intervention in these patients' care."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,86,"Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Presentation in A Middle-Aged African American Female Patient   Introduction:  This is a case presentation of a 68-year-old African American female who has presented with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Given the typical demographic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  this patient fits with the current characterization  as the most cases affect postmenopausal women  age 58-75.  Patient Presentation:  This patient  who is disabled and lives alone  was brought to our facility for evaluation after collapsing at home. She complained of severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations. She has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes  all of which are well controlled with medications. However  she denies any known history of heart disease.   Past Medical History:  Past medical history includes type 2 diabetes managed with Metformin and insulin  hyperlipidemia controlled with Atorvastatin  hypertension managed by Lisinopril. Further  she has a history of anxiety and depression and takes Fluoxetine daily.  Social History:  The patient reported experiencing severe emotional distress due to a recent death of a close family member.  She's had a 20 pack-year history of smoking but quit approximately 10 years ago and consumes alcohol socially. Patient denies any illicit drug use.  Discussion:  Takotsubo or """"broken heart syndrome"""" predominantly affects postmenopausal women often in the context of severe physical or emotional stress. This patient's recent severe emotional stress  coupled with her complaints of chest pain  dyspnea  palpitations and her demographic profile  led to the suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Conclusion:  With takotsubo cardiomyopathy being increasingly recognized as a mimic of acute coronary syndrome  it is important to consider this diagnosis especially in postmenopausal women presenting with chest pain amid significant emotional distress. Early recognition and distinct management strategy of this condition can significantly improve patient outcomes."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,87,"Patient Presentation:  I'd like to present Ms. Julie M.  a 68-year-old Caucasian woman from Oregon who came to the emergency room with acute chest discomfort. Her medical history includes controlled hypertension and non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus. She also has a habit of moderate smoking in the past.  Ms. M recently had an intensive emotional distress event as she lost her husband two weeks ago. She describes her chest pain as sudden  severe  and radiating to the left arm  much similar to the classic presentation of an acute coronary syndrome. However  she doesn't have any shortness of breath  palpitations  or syncope. She has not been feeling well since her husband’s passing.  Upon examination  her blood pressure is slightly elevated  and heart rate is tachycardic. Due to her constellation of symptoms and her recent emotional distress  she was suspected to have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also commonly known as """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Electrocardiography showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. Labs showed slightly elevated troponin levels while other cardiac enzymes and complete metabolic panel turned out to be within normal limits. Echocardiography and coronary angiography ruled out acute occlusive coronary syndrome but showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal segments.  These findings further substantiated the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  a condition classically seen in post-menopausal women  induced by emotional stress. The treatment plan involves supportive care  treating her blood pressure and diabetes  and referring her to a counselor for her emotional distress. Prognosis for this condition is generally good  with some people experiencing complete recovery within a few weeks to a couple of months. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,88,Title: Presentation of a Case with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:  Mrs. Chen  a 65-year-old Asian female  has presented to the Emergency Department with severe chest pain  akin to the pain felt during a myocardial infarction. The patient reports the sudden onset of these symptoms  accompanied by shortness of breath and lightheadedness  following a major emotional stress event that occurred several hours ago. Mrs. Chen has no known drug allergies.  Past medical History:  Mrs. Chen has a past medical history significant for hypertension  controlled with Losartan. She also suffers from type II diabetes  managed by Metformin and a controlled diet. Of note  she also underwent a total hysterectomy at the age of 50 due to uterine fibroids. She does not have any prior history of heart disease  smoke or alcohol use.   Literature Context:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  primarily affects post-menopausal women and is often triggered by acute emotional or physical stress. This condition mimics symptoms of acute coronary syndrome  causing chest pain and breathlessness. Asians  like Mrs. Chen  are also found to be at higher risk of developing stress cardiomyopathy compared to other racial groups.  This presentation reflects the typical demographic and clinical characteristics of a patient with takotsubo cardiomyopathy as found in the literature. The disease is often mistaken for a heart attack due to the similarity in symptom presentation  emphasizing the importance of accurate diagnosis via cardiac imaging and angiography to rule out obstructive coronary disease. Management involves supportive treatment and monitoring for complications  given that the disease is typically self-limiting and reversible.  It is key to mention that patients with a history of hypertension  like Mrs. Chen  are reported to be at a higher risk for takotsubo cardiomyopathy  as shown by literature. Therefore  regular follow-ups  maintaining control over hypertension  and managing stressful events will be crucial steps in preventing recurrent episodes in such individuals.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,89,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Demographics:  Ms. Isabella Johnson is a post-menopausal  70-year-old widow of Caucasian descent. She lives alone in the suburbs of New York and is retired after working for several decades as a school teacher.   Past Medical History:  Ms. Johnson has been diagnosed with hypertension and Type II diabetes. Her health records indicate regular usage of antihypertensive drugs and oral hypoglycemic agents. She does not have a history of smoking or alcohol consumption. As of her last check-up six months ago  her symptoms were well-controlled.  Presenting Issue: Ms. Johnson presents today following a major acute stressful incident. She lost her younger sister suddenly last week  with whom she was extremely close. This traumatic event has led her to exhibit symptoms consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome. She complains of severe chest pain  similar to a heart attack  and difficulty in breathing.   Noteworthy is that  much like other Takotsubo cardiomyopathy cases  Ms. Johnson does not have a history of coronary artery disease. While takotsubo cardiomyopathy commonly occurs in postmenopausal women like Ms. Isabella Johnson  this condition remains relatively rare. It is essential to highlight its association with acute emotional distress  significantly affecting the patient's diagnosis  treatment  and recovery.  In summary  this patient represents a typical demographic for takotsubo cardiomyopathy – a postmenopausal woman experiencing recent severe emotional distress  showcasing heart attack-like symptoms  but with no history of coronary artery disease. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,90,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1:  Patient Demographics Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female named Mrs. Smith. This demographic aligns accurately with the majority of reported cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which predominantly affects post-menopausal women.   Slide 2: Past Medical History Mrs. Smith has a rich history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the last decade. She is a non-smoker and her alcohol intake is within the recommended guidelines. She has no history of illicit drug use. Her family history is also significant for cardiac diseases  her mother and father both suffered from heart conditions.  Slide 3: Current Situation Mrs. Smith presented with severe chest pain that started suddenly while she was dealing with a family dispute  which was deemed significantly stressful. The chest pain was unremitting and similar to a heavy pressure sensation. She also reported shortness of breath and generalized fatigue.  Slide 4: Physical Examination and Diagnosis Upon physical examination  Mrs. Smith was observed to be in distress but her vital signs were relatively stable. Electrocardiography revealed ST-segment elevation  mimicking an acute myocardial infarction. However  angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease to account for the EKG abnormalities. An echocardiography showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hypokinesia  indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Slide 5: Implications The above findings correspond to the classical presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition typically triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. The condition presents similar to an acute coronary syndrome but is distinguished by characteristic wall motion abnormalities in the absence of significant coronary artery disease. Despite appearing alarming  most patients typically enjoy a good prognosis with full recovery.  In summary  our 68-year-old patient suffering from Takotsubo cardiomyopathy exhibits the common demographic pattern and symptomatology for this condition.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,91,"Patient Presentation:  We have  Ms. Ana Francisco  a 68-year-old Asian-American woman  from Sacramento  California. She is a retired schoolteacher  lives alone  and her BMI is 24 indicating she is within a healthy weight range. No significant family history of cardiac disease has been reported.   Ana's past medical history is significant for hypertension for which she is on medication along with recurring episodes of anxiety and panic attacks. She is a non-smoker and reports having only occasional alcohol. She also mentioned having a stressful incident at home in this week. Her last annual physical examination 6 months ago was unremarkable.  The patient presented with severe chest pain  citing a sudden onset. She reports that the pain feels like """"an elephant standing"""" on her chest. The pain started abruptly  amid a heightened emotional state  following a distressing telephonic conversation with her son. Symptoms include nausea  shortness of breath  and excessive sweating. She denies any headache  abdominal pain  vomiting  and numbness.   Objective findings include an elevated heart rate of 110 beats/min  blood pressure of 150/95 mm Hg  and mildly decreased oxygen saturation at 95%. An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation  and primary lab diagnostic results suggested elevated cardiac enzyme levels.  Conclusion:  Given the patient's age  gender  symptoms  and upon witnessing the temporarily ballooned left ventricle on echocardiography  she was given a presumptive diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken-heart syndrome"""". This correlates appropriately with the demographic most commonly affected by tachycardia cardiomyopathy: postmenopausal women. The preceding emotional stressor is also typical in such presentations.  This condition usually mimics symptoms of acute coronary syndrome but is characterized by temporary dysfunction of the left ventricular apex and the mid-ventricular segments. It is a rare but increasingly recognized cause of acute heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias. Age  gender  stress factors  and hypertension are all risk factors for takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The condition usually has a good prognosis with appropriate management.   Ms. Francisco will require further diagnostic tests such as coronary angiography to rule out underlying coronary artery disease  and suitable supportive management. Follow-up is necessary to monitor the resolution of the cardiac abnormalities. Psychological support and stress management measures might be helpful going forward."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,92,"Title: A Case Presentation on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Summary: Our patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian female who is presenting with typical chest pain  acute dyspnea  nausea  and generalized weakness which started suddenly. The patient has no known coronary artery disease (CAD) or a negligible atherosclerotic burden and has  hitherto  maintained solid overall health. Her past medical history includes hypertension  for which she is on amlodipine  and hyperlipidemia  managed with atorvastatin. She also presents with episodes of anxiety  particularly in relation to high-stress situations.  Presentation: The patient was immediately stabilized  and her vital signs taken showed a blood pressure of 150/90 and a heart rate of 110  both of which are significantly higher than her typical readings recorded in her past medical visits. Initial blood tests showed slightly elevated Troponin levels  suggesting possible heart damage. An electrocardiogram (ECG) suggested ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)  despite the absence of significant atherosclerosis or any previously known CAD.   Further diagnostic Procedures: An emergency coronary angiography was performed following the ECG results  which showed no occlusion typical of a heart attack. A further echocardiogram showed significant left ventricle (LV) systolic dysfunction  with apical ballooning  which is a characteristic feature of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis: Given the symptoms  physical findings  the elevated Troponin levels  and the distinct echocardiogram result  the patient was ultimately diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or """"Broken Heart Syndrome"""". This condition  prominently seen in postmenopausal women  is often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress. The patient's case is consistent with the demographic representation found in literature.  Management and Follow Up: The patient was managed with supportive care  which included beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Follow-up with this patient over the subsequent weeks showed a drastic improvement in her LV systolic function with no further chest pain episodes or conditions relating to the heart.  Discussion: This is a characteristic case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  highlighting the typical demographics (postmenopausal women) and triggers (stress)  as well as the diagnostic dilemma it can present due to its similar presentation to acute coronary syndrome. The patient is continuing on the prescribed management and to date  shows a positive recovery."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,93,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: Ms. Jones is a 72-year-old Asian female  recently widowed. She is retired and lives alone in her suburban home.  Demographics: Statistically  takotsubo cardiomyopathy afflicts older women more often than other demographic groups. Approximately 90% of reported cases are women aged 58 to 75. Though found globally  there is a higher predisposition observed in Asian populations.   Medical History: Ms. Jones has experienced hypertension for the past 20 years  which is well-controlled on medication. She underwent menopause at age 52. She quit smoking 25 years ago and seldom drinks alcohol. Her body mass index (BMI) is 24  placing her in a healthy weight range for her height. She leads an active lifestyle with regular exercise. However  she has been experiencing an increased level of psychological stress in recent months due to the passing of her husband.   Presenting symptoms: Ms. Jones presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute chest pain suggestive of a heart attack. This pain was triggered by a profound emotional stress event - the one-year anniversary of her husband's death. The pain was sudden  severe  and she describes it as 'crushing.'   Diagnostic Findings: Clinical investigations reveal an elevated troponin level and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes indicative of an 'ST-elevation myocardial infarction.' However  on coronary angiography  no significant coronary artery disease was observed. Echocardiography revealed a classic 'takotsubo' or 'octopus pot' morphology with apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesis of the left ventricle  leading to the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome.  Past medical history and the temporal association with an emotional stress event  coupled with the characteristic echocardiographic findings  give a clinical diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy for Ms. Jones. This highlights the importance of understanding demographic propensities and the role of severe stress in precipitating particular presentations of heart disease.   Future care will involve psychological support to handle her grief  as well as careful monitoring and management of her cardiac function.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,94,Patient Presentation:  We present a 68-year-old Caucasian female admitted to the cardiac care unit with a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as broken heart syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy.   The patient initially presented with sudden severe chest pain and shortness of breath  suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. EKG demonstrated ST segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. However  catheterization did not reveal significant coronary artery disease; instead  it showed apical 'ballooning' of the left ventricle  characteristic of TCM.   Additional relevant demographic information: The patient lives alone and is retired. She recently experienced a significant emotional stressor with the sudden death of her husband.  In terms of past medical history  the patient has been treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  but has not had previous cardiac issues. She has a history of anxiety and has been managed with medications. She does not smoke or consume alcohol.  This presentation is consistent with literature  which suggests that TCM predominately affects postmenopausal women  often in the context of severe emotional or physical stress.  Additionally  individuals presenting with TCM often have coexisting neurological or psychiatric disorders.   In conclusion  our patient is a typical case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in terms of demographics  presentation  and comorbidity.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,95,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:   - Patient: Ms. Jane Smith - Age: 70 years old - Sex: Female - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired school teacher - Residence: Urban setting  Presenting Conditions:  The patient presented with acute chest pain and shortness of breath. Initial suspicion was myocardial infarction due to the clinical presentation. She reported that the symptoms had begun a few hours ago while ensconced in a particularly stressful situation.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of hypertension for 10 years  which is well-controlled with medication. She also has hyperlipidemia and type-2 diabetes mellitus since the past 5 years.   Previous history includes one episode of major depressive disorder  treated effectively with psychotherapy and medication. The patient reports that her depression was triggered by a significant bereavement event - the loss of her husband  5 years back. She is a non-smoker and reports occasional alcohol consumption.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress or broken heart syndrome  can be triggered by severe emotional or physical stress causing rapid and severe heart muscle weakness. Clinical presentation often mimics acute coronary syndromes  as seen in this case.  A significant majority of patients diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy are postmenopausal women  as is consistent with our patient demographic. Often  there is a preceding emotional or physical stressor  and this presentation was preceded by a stressful situation as well.   Hypertension and hyperlipidemia  present in this patient  are often seen in takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients. This case highlights that elderly women  particularly postmenopausal  with a history of psychological disorders and/or stressful events are at a higher risk for takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Despite the similarity in initial presentation  the pathophysiology  management  and prognosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is vastly different from that of a conventional heart attack  putting a premium on accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan for this disorder.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,96,"Title: Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Information: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian female presenting in the ER with chest pain and significant respiratory distress. She is originally from Pennsylvania and a retired school teacher. She lives alone in an independent living senior community.   Past Medical History (PMH): The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with antihypertensives and statins  respectively. Her family history reveals her father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 55 but survived and lived into his 80s.   Presenting Problem: Over the past 24 hours  the patient experienced severe chest pain which increased during any form of exertion. She was initially seen by her family physician  who  based on the initial exam and EKG  suspected she was experiencing a heart attack and transferred her to the hospital emergency department.    Comprehensive history-taking in the emergency department revealed that the patient recently suffered a major emotional loss as her only son passed away 2 weeks prior after a long battle with cancer. She has had difficulty sleeping and eating since the event and admits to feeling """"overwhelmed"""" by stress and grief.  In the Er  her blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg  pulse 110/min  and EKG showed ST-segment elevation in precordial leads  contributing to the suspicion of a myocardial infarction.  However  cardiac catheterization showed no evidence of significant coronary artery disease to justify the observed EKG changes. Echocardiogram revealed a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with apical ballooning  a phenomenon typically not seen in patients experiencing a heart attack.  Mental status examination revealed her to appear under significant stress with symptoms consistent with Acute Stress Disorder.   Based on the patient's clinical presentation  past medical  and recent emotional history  the diagnostic suspicion of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy was raised.  Concluding Remarks: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" often mimics symptoms found in acute myocardial infarction. While it disproportionately affects postmenopausal women  it can occur in individuals of any age or gender. Precipitating factors are usually physical or emotional stress  in this case  the patient's bereavement. Although it is typically reversible  early recognition and supportive management are crucial to prevent potential complications."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,97,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presenting to the Emergency Department with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. She reports the pain initiated abruptly following an intense argument with her son. She also reports feeling light-headed and short of breath.   Past Medical History:  Patient has a history of hypertension  generalized anxiety disorder  and hyperlipidemia  all currently controlled with medications. She underwent a partial mastectomy for benign breast disease 10 years ago. There is no history of drug or alcohol abuse and she is a non-smoker. She denies any known history of coronary artery disease  however  has never undergone any coronary imaging or diagnostic studies.  Discussion:  This clinical scenario is consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome."""" This condition typically presents similar to acute coronary syndrome  with chest pain and dyspnea being the most common symptoms. It predominantly affects post-menopausal women and stress appears to be a significant precipitating factor. The exact pathophysiology of takotsubo cardiomyopathy remains under investigation  however it is believed that excessive catecholamine release secondary to acute emotional or physical stress plays a significant role.   It's important to differentiate takotsubo cardiomyopathy from acute coronary syndrome given the pathophysiological differences and potential therapeutic implications. Diagnosis requires coronary angiography to rule out obstructive coronary artery disease as well as evidence of left ventricular dysfunction on cardiac imaging.   In this patient's case  the combination of her gender  age group  the emotional stress prior to symptom onset and absence of significant risk factors for CAD make takotsubo cardiomyopathy a relevant differential diagnosis."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,98,"Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  I. Introduction  We present the case of a postmenopausal 65-year-old Asian woman presenting with a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as 'broken heart syndrome.' According to available literature  CDC reports  and demographic representation  women  particularly postmenopausal women  comprise the majority of TTC cases. Furthermore  there seems to be a higher prevalence among Asian populations.  II. Demographics  The patient is a retired elementary school teacher  who lives in a suburb in California. She is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol. She lives with her husband  and reports high levels of stress due to recent bereavement over the death of a close family member.   III. Past Medical History   She has a documented history of hypertension  which is well-controlled with Lisinopril 10 mg/day. No other significant cardiac history is reported  and her only other past medical history indicates osteoporosis  for which she's currently receiving Alendronate 70 mg/week. Routine lab tests  including basic metabolic panel and complete blood count  have previously been within normal ranges. She has an intolerance to statins and is currently not on any cholesterol-lowering medication.  IV. Presenting Complaint   The patient was brought to the ER due to sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. There were no apparent triggers except for an emotionally stressful event that occurred a day prior – the funeral of her younger sister. Chest pain was described as severe  gripping in nature  and exacerbated on exertion.   In conclusion  TTC is an often under-recognized and poorly understood condition. It is vital to accurately diagnose and manage patients with TTC. Though our patient fits the demographic pattern seen commonly in literature  it's important to remember that anyone  irrespective of age or sex  can develop this condition  often under times of intense emotional or physical stress.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,99,Title: Presentation of Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Demographic Information:  Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female from a suburban region. She is a retired school teacher and a widow for the last three years. Her socio-economic status is average  and she lives alone but maintains close contact with her only son who lives not too far from her. In terms of lifestyle  she does not smoke  rarely consumes alcohol  and tries to maintain a balanced diet.  Past Medical History:  The patient had been generally healthy her entire life  with no prior history of cardiac illness. She has a history of well-controlled hypertension  for which she has been taking Amlodipine 5 mg daily for the past decade. Also  she is diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with ongoing counseling and treatment  including regular use of an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor)  Sertraline. Aside from an appendectomy in her late 20s  her surgical history is unremarkable. Her family history includes stroke in her father  breast cancer in her mother  but no history of heart disease.  As found in literature  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  otherwise known as broken-heart syndrome  predominantly afflicts postmenopausal women  especially those with a history of neurologic or psychiatric disorders  including anxiety and depression. Albeit rarely  it can be set off by intense emotional or physical stress  which is linked to an adrenaline surge. Our patient’s demographic information and past medical history align accurately with these characteristics common among takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients. Future care and treatment will require a thorough assessment of her stress levels  psychiatric condition  and blood pressure control.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,1,100,"Patient Presentation: Mrs. Jane Davis  Demographic Information: Mrs. Jane Davis is a 75-year-old  Caucasian female from a suburban residential area. She is retired  a widow with three adult children  and lives independently.   Past Medical History: She has a history of hypertension  controlled with medication for over a decade  but no other known cardiovascular disease. She is non-diabetic and non-smoker. She has had no prior vascular events or interventions. She has a history of anxiety disorder and has been dealing with chronic stress due to recent familial issues.   Presenting Problem: Mrs. Davis presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  which she initially thought was a heart attack. The onset of her symptoms coincided with extreme emotional stress; the death of her husband a month ago.  Clinical Findings: Initial electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST-segment elevation  which is usually indicative of an acute myocardial infarction. However  subsequent coronary angiography reported no significant coronary artery disease that might have explained the initial EKG findings. An echocardiogram demonstrated left ventricular apical ballooning with preserved basal function  suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome.  Clinical Course: Mrs. Davis was treated with conservative management and advised to participate in stress reduction practices like yoga and mindfulness exercises. On the subsequent follow-up  her symptoms improved  and repeat echocardiography showed improvement in her heart function.  Summary: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or """"broken heart syndrome """" is characteristically seen in post-menopausal women  often precipitated by severe physical or emotional stress. It can mimic myocardial infarction  but unlike the former  takotsubo cardiomyopathy is reversible and has a very good prognosis if appropriately identified and managed.   In Mrs. Davis's case  the unanticipated loss of her husband was the stressor that precipitated her presentation. Emotional support  together with clinical management  is vital in the recovery process of patients with this condition. It is also essential to monitor these patients closely as they have an increased risk of recurrence  particularly if the stressful situations continue.   Early recognition and understanding of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are therefore crucial to implementing appropriate management strategies and improving patient outcomes."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,1,"Patient Presentation: A 68-year-old Asian female presents to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm and associated with shortness of breath. The pain started suddenly a few hours ago  and she describes it as a heavy  crushing sensation. Her medical history is significant for hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  both of which are well-controlled with medication. She recently lost her husband of 45 years to cancer a week ago.  She quit smoking twenty years ago and does not drink alcohol. Family history is notable for a brother with coronary artery disease diagnosed at a similar age. She denies any illicit drug use or recent trauma. She is retired  lives alone and has been very stressed dealing with the loss of her spouse.  On physical examination  the patient is afebrile  with a heart rate of 110 beats/min  blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min and SpO2 at 94% on room air. Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia but no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. The chest pain is not reproducible with palpation.  ECG shows ST segment elevations in the precordial leads  but the initial serum troponin level is only mildly elevated. Chest X-ray is unremarkable with no signs of congestive heart failure. The patient is initially treated for an acute coronary syndrome  but a coronary angiogram shows no significant blockages. Echocardiogram reveals a reduced ejection fraction with akinesis of the mid and apical segments of the left ventricle  and hypercontractility of the basal segments  the classic shape of """"takotsubo"""" - a Japanese pot with a round bottom and narrow neck - giving the condition its name  takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,2,A 72-year-old Japanese woman presents to the emergency department with symptoms of acute chest pain and shortness of breath that started a couple of hours ago. She also reports feeling extremely anxious and stressed due to the sudden death of her beloved husband the day before.  Past medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes for which she takes a combination of lisinopril and amlodipine. She has a history of depression and is currently on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy. She is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol. She has no known drug allergies.  Her family history includes a father who died at 65 from myocardial infarction and a mother currently living with Alzheimer's disease.   The symptoms she exhibits - chest pain  dyspnea  stress - combined with her demographic details and the timing of symptoms closely follow an episode of emotional stress related to bereavement  which leads the healthcare professional to suspect takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome'.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,3,Patient Presentation:   A 67-year-old Asian woman  Mrs. A  has come to the emergency department with acute chest pain which started a couple of hours ago after she had been informed about the sudden death of her only son. She describes it as a heavy  crushing pain on the left side of her chest radiating to her left arm  which is accompanied by shortness of breath. Her pain has not improved with rest.   Medical History:  Mrs. A has no previous cardiovascular disease but is a known hypertensive patient and has been on amlodipine for two years. She is not diabetic and does not have any other significant diseases. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her BMI is within a normal range and she leads an active lifestyle without any periodic episodes of chest pain or syncope. She has been experiencing ongoing bouts of grief and stress since her husband's death two years ago. This recent event has caused a significant emotional trauma.  This patient presentation suggests Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy/broken heart syndrome). This condition often presents similarly to acute coronary syndrome  with chest pain and ST elevation on EKG  but typically occurs following a significant emotional or physical stressor. The condition is more common in postmenopausal women and is likely related to reduced estrogen levels leading to enhanced sympathetic stimulation.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,4,A 69-year-old  Hispanic female presents to the ED with sudden onset of severe chest pain after the sudden death of her husband earlier in the day. Patient reports the chest pain as a crushing sensation  similar to previous episodes of angina  and rates it 9/10. The pain is associated with dyspnea  lightheadedness  and diaphoresis. It radiates to her left shoulder and started about two hours ago.  She has a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and chronic kidney disease (stage 3). Her medications include amlodipine  metoprolol  and atorvastatin. She is a former smoker and quit 15 years ago. She consumes alcohol socially and denies drug abuse.   Her father died of myocardial infarction at age 60. She’s previously had stress tests that were negative and echocardiograms showing normal cardiac function due to her chest pain episodes. She reports compliance with her medications.   On examination  her BP is 170/90  heart rate 110  respirations are 20  and her O2 saturation on room air is 94%. Her cardiac exam reveals tachycardia but no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Rest of her physical exam is unremarkable.   Today's ECG shows ST segment elevation in precordial leads  consistent with acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. Cardiac enzymes are elevated with Troponin I of 2.3 ng/mL. She is immediately started on aspirin  nitroglycerin  and heparin and moved to the catheterization lab. A coronary angiogram reveals no significant coronary artery disease. However  left ventriculogram demonstrates apical ballooning and basal hypercontractility consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,5,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Elena Wilson  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating down her left arm  associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. Mrs. Wilson almost faints while discussing her symptoms. She describes her chest pain as a sudden ‘crushing’ sensation that started about an hour ago.   Relevant past medical history: Mrs. Wilson is a retired school teacher and she lives alone. Her medical history revels she suffers from hypertension controlled with medication. She was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder a few years back but has recently experienced increased levels of anxiety and emotional distress secondary to the sudden death of her husband 3 weeks ago. Her husband's death was sudden and unexpected  which has caused her significant grief. Mrs. Wilson reports she has been experiencing a poor appetite and disturbed sleep over the last few weeks.  Mrs. Wilson does not have any history of illicit drug or alcohol abuse. She has never smoked cigarettes and she has no family history of heart diseases.   Upon further inquiry  Mrs. Wilosn reveals she did feel a similar  but less severe and short-lived  chest discomfort after hearing about her husband's death. However  she didn’t seek medical attention then  attributing it to anxiety. She has an allergy to penicillin. She does not exercise regularly and acknowledges that her diet could be healthier  admitting a preference for convenience foods and dining out.   Upon presentation  her vital signs were: Blood pressure 150/85  heart rate 92  respiratory rate 20  and SpO2 98% on room air.   This clinical presentation is suspicious for takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome)  this diagnosis should be confirmed by diagnostic imaging studies.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,6,"A 68-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain and difficulty breathing that started about 2 hours ago. The pain is described as a heavy sensation in the center of the chest that radiates to the left arm and jaw. She denies any other associated symptoms like nausea  vomiting  palpitation  or syncope.  Her medical background is significant for hypertension  moderately controlled on medication  and no history of ischemic heart disease. She does not have any history of illicit drug use  alcohol  or tobacco. She does not have any prior history of similar symptoms.   Reviewing her recent social history  she has been under significant psychological stress over the past two weeks due to the sudden loss of her spouse.   On examination  she appears anxious and in acute distress. Initial ECG shows no evidence of ST-segment changes or Q waves  which are typical of a heart attack.  Considering her age  sex  the onset of symptoms after an episode of severe emotional stress  along with the clinical findings and a possible diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""" is considered.   Further cardiac enzyme tests  Echocardiogram  and Coronary Angiography are planned for definitive diagnosis."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,7,"A 68-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath  extreme fatigue and nausea. The pain started suddenly about 2 hours ago while she was attending the funeral of her husband  who she was married to for 45 years.   Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia which are well-controlled with lisinopril and atorvastatin  respectively. She has a 20-pack year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. There is no personal or family history of heart disease. Physical examination revealed she was mildly tachycardic and had profuse sweating. Initial EKG showed ST-elevation in the anterior leads.  This presentation is highly suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  and is consistent with literature which indicates the majority of patients are postmenopausal women with around 90% of cases occurring in those aged >50 years. It is often triggered by acute emotional or physical stress and presents much like an acute coronary syndrome. Dyspnea and chest pain are commonly observed symptoms. These patients typically have lesser cardiovascular risk factors compared to those with acute coronary syndrome. Women tend to have a higher representation due to effects of estrogen loss after menopause."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,8,"A 69-year-old Caucasian widow presented in the emergency department shortly after learning about her son's sudden death. The patient appeared anxious and was complaining of acute severe chest pain likened to a """"burning sensation"""" radiating down to her left arm  associated with shortness of breath  nausea  and excessive sweating. The pain began abruptly an hour after receiving the tragic news and didn't change even after taking her usual sublingual nitroglycerin  which she normally applies for her chronic stable angina.  Her medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are well-controlled under medication. She takes regularly her prescribed medications  which include lisinopril  atorvastatin  and aspirin  besides sublingual nitroglycerin for angina episodes. She is a former smoker  with a 20-pack year history  and quit smoking 10 years back. She denies alcohol or illicit substance use. Apart from angina  she hasn't experienced any severe chest pain or dyspnea before this. There isn't any personal or family history of myocardial infarction or other forms of heart disease.  On physical examination  she appeared pale and diaphoretic. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 110 beats/min  blood pressure of 160/90 mm Hg  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min  oxygen saturation of 95% on room air  and temperature of 36.7°C.  This presentation raises the suspicion of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  often seen with this demographic and in the wake of severe emotional stress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,9,A 68-year-old Asian female presents to the emergency department experiencing severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient's vital signs on arrival cc are a temperature of 98.6°F  blood pressure 165/95mmHg  heart rate of 112 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Patient also reports feeling that her heart is beating rapidly and irregularly.  She mentions that her husband passed away unexpectedly one week ago  and she's been under extreme emotional stress since then. Her past medical history is unremarkable  besides being hypertensive and having well-controlled type 2 diabetes. She does not smoke or consume alcohol and has no family history significant for any cardiac disorders.  Her physical examination is largely unremarkable other than mild diaphoresis and pallor. ECG reveals ST segment elevation in the anterior leads suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. However  the patient's coronary angiogram is free from significant blockages. An echocardiogram shows transient left ventricular apical ballooning without any obstructive coronary artery disease  suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  The patient's symptoms  coupled with her significant recent emotional stress and the absence of a history of ischemic heart disease  point towards a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,10,A 68-year-old Caucasian female with a history of major depressive disorder and early-stage breast cancer with lumpectomy and radiation therapy 6 months prior  came to the Emergency Department. She was complaining of acute onset severe chest pain radiating to her left arm and associated with shortness of breath. The chest pain began suddenly later in the evening  a few hours after hearing about the suicide of a long-time close friend. She described it as 'crushing'  similar to what she perceived a heart attack would feel like. On examination  she is diaphoretic and appears anxious  with a blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg  heart rate of 100 bpm  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.     Takotsubo cardiomyopathy frequently presents in postmenopausal women with a recent history of significant emotional or physical stress  and this woman’s experience of learning about her friend’s suicide fits that bill. She also has a breast cancer history  which is a common comorbidity among Takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients as per literature. This condition is also more prevalent among patients with a history of neuropsychiatric disorders  like the major depressive disorder in her case.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,11,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian female who presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain is described as intense  burning  located in the center of the chest  and radiating to the left arm. These symptoms initiated after she received news of her son's unexpected passing. Apart from occasional episodes of hypertension controlled with medications  she reports no previous cardiovascular disease  no smoking or alcohol consumption  and no family history of early coronary artery disease. She has generally enjoyed good health  with only a history of mild osteoporosis.   On examination  her blood pressure measures 166/92 mmHg  her heart rate is 112 beats per minute  her respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute  and her oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. She appears visibly distressed and reports feeling extremely anxious.  Relevant lab findings reveal a slightly elevated white blood cell count and a significantly elevated troponin level. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  consistent with an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  a subsequent coronary angiography reveals no coronary artery occlusion. A left ventriculography shows apical ballooning with hypercontraction of the basal walls  which is consistent with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,12,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian female who presents to the emergency department with acute onset of severe chest pain that began approximately 2 hours ago after she received news of her brother's sudden death. The pain was described as a heavy sensation in the mid-chest  radiating to her left shoulder. Associated symptoms included dyspnea  nausea  and lightheadedness.  Upon further questioning  she reports a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both well-managed with medication. She denies any past diagnoses of coronary artery disease or any previous cardiac events. Apart from regular intake of her antihypertensive and statin medication  she denies any other medication use  including recreational drugs.  Her family history reveals her mother had a heart attack at age 75. She is a non-smoker and drinks occasional alcohol  with no known drug allergies.  On arrival  her vital signs are within normal limits although her blood pressure is at the higher end of normal  likely due to the stress of the situation. Her physical examination reveals diaphoresis  but no other abnormalities. The rest of her exam  including lung and neurological  are unremarkable. An EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Emergency department clinicians have initiated acute coronary syndrome protocol but have referred to cardiology for further management due to suspicion of possible takotsubo cardiomyopathy given her recent severe emotional stress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,13,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. Maria Lopez  a 68 year-old Hispanic female  presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe  sudden chest pain with shortness of breath beginning earlier this morning. The pain is described as a sharp  constricting discomfort  radiating to her left arm. Maria reports additional symptoms of nausea  vomiting  and lightheadedness.   Maria is a retired school teacher currently living alone. She recently experienced the death of her husband three months ago  followed by a very stressful legal dispute related to the family estate. Her past medical history is significant for noted hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She is on Losartan 50mg daily and Simvastatin 20mg daily  and she expresses adherence to both medications. Maria denies current tobacco use; she quit 20 years ago  and she does not drink alcohol.  There is no history of any sudden onset chest pain or any known cardiovascular disease in the past. She had an echocardiogram done two years ago  which showed normal cardiac function and no valvular heart disease. Family history is significant for a maternal history of myocardial infarction and a paternal history of stroke.  Considering the patient's demographic profile  acute clinical presentation  and recent stressful life events  a tentative clinical diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly known as """"broken heart syndrome """" is considered. Immediate cardiac investigations are being ordered to confirm the diagnosis."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,14,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Riley  a 68-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain. The chest pain started roughly an hour ago  radiating to the shoulders and neck  and was associated with diaphoresis  nausea  and light-headedness. She reports she has been extremely stressed after the sudden death of her spouse one week ago.  Patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension  which has been managed on Ramipril for the past five years and generalized anxiety disorder for which she takes sertraline. She denies any history of ischemic heart disease  diabetes  stroke  or any previous heart conditions. Ms. Riley is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially. Her family history is significant for a mother who died of myocardial infarction in her seventies.  Physical examination reveals an jittery woman in significant distress  appearing older than her stated age. Vital signs reveal BP 160/95 mmHg  pulse 110/min  RR 20/min. Cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia with regular rhythm. There are no appreciable murmurs  rubs  or gallops heard on auscultation. The rest of the physical exam is unremarkable.  Given the acute onset of the chest pain and the stressor it is possible Ms. Riley could be suffering from takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome. Appropriate diagnostic tests include an EKG and cardiac enzymes to initially rule out a myocardial infarction. Echocardiogram would then be needed to distinguish takotsubo from other cardiac conditions.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,15,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Yoshino  a 71-year-old Asian female  presents to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain and discomfort. The pain began suddenly two hours ago and is described as severe  pressure-like  and radiating to the left arm. She is sweating and feeling light-headed.   On closer questioning  Ms. Yoshino admits that she has been under a great deal of stress lately. Her husband passed away unexpectedly two weeks ago  and she's been having difficulty coping with the loss.  Ms. Yoshino has a past medical history significant for hypertension controlled with Losartan and hypercholesterolemia managed with Atorvastatin. She is a non-smoker  and there is no personal or family history of cardiovascular disease. Notably  the patient's mother was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy at the age of 68 after a severe emotional stress event.  Upon examination  Ms. Yoshino appears in distress  with an initial blood pressure reading of 160/90 mmHg and a heart rate of 110 per minute. Her respirations are mildy elevated at 20 per minute and she is afebrile. The cardiovascular exam reveals a regular rhythm  no murmurs  rubs  or gallops  but mild tachycardia. Lung exam demonstrates clear breath sounds bilaterally  and her other system exams are unremarkable.  ECG shows ST segment elevation in the anterolateral leads with no evidence of previous MI  suggesting an acute coronary syndrome. A troponin test confirms the presence of cardiac injury.  With her current symptoms  past medical history  recent extreme emotional stress  characteristic ECG changes  and raised cardiac enzymes  Ms. Yoshino is highly suspected to have a Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Further diagnostic studies including echocardiography  coronary angiography  left ventriculography  and cardiac MRI may be performed for definitive diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,16,Demographics: 66-year-old post-menopausal Caucasian female  Presenting complaints: Ms. Johns reports experiencing sudden  severe chest pain and shortness of breath over the past few hours. She says these symptoms started abruptly and describes the pain as a heavy sensation that radiates down her left arm and up to her jaw.  Past medical history: Ms. Johns has no previously diagnosed heart conditions. She is hypertensive for which she regularly takes lisinopril. She acknowledges being a non-smoker and a social drinker. She lost her husband to cancer six months ago. She states that ever since  she has been experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety.  Family history: Mother had type 2 diabetes and father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 70. She has a brother  68  with coronary artery disease.  Social History: She lives alone after her husband's death  retired school teacher  former pet owner  no significant financial stressors  does occasional counseling. She regularly attends the local church's grief support group.  Review of Systems: No history of syncope  palpitations  fatigue  or pre-syncope. No leg swelling  weight changes  cough or high fever. No recent injury or surgery.  This presentation is consistent with literature showing a predominance of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in elderly  post-menopausal women under acute emotional stress (often a bereavement) with an otherwise relatively uneventful cardiovascular history. The symptoms described mimic those of an acute coronary syndrome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,17,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Brown is a 68-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for well-controlled hypertension and anxiety disorder. She presents to the Emergency Department with sudden severe central chest pain of 2-hour duration. The pain is described as a crushing sensation  radiating to her left arm and associated with shortness of breath. Ms. Brown reports that her symptoms started abruptly following a heated argument with her neighbor.   On further interrogation  she also disclosed experiencing increasing stress levels surrounding her current living situation and family problems. She denies similar previous episodes  tobacco or alcohol use  and has no family history of premature heart disease. She has been compliant with her antihypertensive medication. On physical examination  she is in distress with initial vital signs revealing blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breathes per minute and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Resting 12-lead electrocardiogram reveals ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads.   Given her symptoms and EKG findings  there is a high suspicion for acute coronary syndrome; however takotsubo cardiomyopathy (or stress-induced cardiomyopathy) is also a differential  considering the significant emotional stress she has been experiencing prior to the onset of symptoms.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,18,A 65-year-old Asian female patient presents in the Emergency Department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain onset was a couple of hours ago  triggered by a severe emotional distress on hearing about the sudden demise of her brother. The pain is crushing in nature and is radiating to the left arm  accompanied by diaphoresis. On enquiry  she reveals that she had a similar episode around a year ago  immediately following her husband's death  which was attributed to anxiety and she was treated symptomatically.  Her medical history reveals that she is hypertensive and is on a regular medication of Amlodipine 5mg  once a day. She admits to not being regular with her medications. She denies any history of smoking or alcohol use. No significant family history of cardiac diseases is noted. Her basic metabolic panel from a routine check-up two months ago suggested mild hyperlipidemia.  On examination  her blood pressure is measured to be 170/90 mmHg and her heart rate is 110 beats per minute. Her EKG reveals ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads suggestive of an ongoing myocardial ischemia.  Considering her age  gender  underlying stressors  ethnicity  and medical history  a presumptive diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is considered. Immediate intervention is initiated and further investigations are planned to confirm the diagnosis and decide on the future course of therapy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,19,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. Johnson  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the Emergency Department with acute onset substernal chest pain radiating to her left jaw. The pain was severe  9/10 in intensity  squeezing in nature and associated with shortness of breath and sweating. She has a past medical history notable for hypertension  which is currently managed with hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. Allergies include penicillin.  Her husband of 40 years passed away suddenly 1 month ago  and Ms. Johnson has been experiencing significant emotional stress as a result. The chest pain began abruptly while she was watching her late husband's favorite movie at home.   Vitals include BP 160/95mmHg  HR 102 bpm  RR 20/min  temperature 37.1°C  SpO2 94% on room air. On auscultation  regular heart sounds were heard with no added sounds. EKG showed slight ST elevations in the anterolateral leads. Troponin levels were significantly increased.  Given her clinical presentation  elevated stress levels  and test results  a differential diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was considered. The patient was admitted for further diagnostic workup with transthoracic echo and coronary angiogram to confirm suspected takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often also referred to as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome""""  due to its frequent onset after severe emotional distress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,20,"Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old Japanese woman presents to the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. She describes the pain as “crushing” and rates it a 10/10. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and nausea.  She reports experiencing extreme emotional stress as her husband  of 47 years  passed away two weeks ago. The onset of her chest pain occurred in the middle of a weeping episode over her husband.  Past Medical History: The patient is known with Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension. She's compliant with her daily Metformin and Lisinopril  prescribed for her Diabetes and Hypertension respectively. She doesn't smoke or drink alcohol  but she is obese with BMI of 32. She has no history of cardiac disease  stroke  or other significant medical problems  but a few of her close relatives had coronary artery disease.  Upon examination  she appears anxious and in distress. Her blood pressure is 150/90mmHg  heart rate 110 beats/min  respirations 24 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation 92% on room air.  Considering her recent severe emotional trauma  clinical signs and symptoms  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  is suspected.  This patient's profile represents a typical demographic for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: post-menopausal women of Asian descent  often presenting after a recent significant emotional stressor. The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes  common comorbid conditions associated with this cardiomyopathy are also noted."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,21,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Johnson  a 68-year-old Caucasian woman  presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. She describes the sudden onset of this symmetrical and crushing pain this morning  which was exacerbated by physical activity and did not relieve with rest. She is feeling nauseous and also reports periodic episodes of mild shortness of breath.  She is a widow recently experienced multiple stressful life events  including the death of her husband six months ago  and she moved from her lifelong home shortly thereafter. The patient denies tobacco  alcohol or illegal drug usage but admits of being anxious most of the time.   Ms. Johnson has a documented history of hypertension  which is managed by a calcium channel blocker  amlodipine. She also has well-controlled type 2 diabetes  managed with metformin.   On physical examination  she appeared distressed and anxious. Her vitals were blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute  oxygen saturation of 94% on room air and a body mass index of 25 kg/m2.  The combination of her symptoms  age  gender  recent severe emotional stress  and history of hypertension suggest a likely diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  but further tests  such as an EKG and cardiac biomarker tests  are needed for accurate diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,22,Subject Demographics: Female  Age: 70  Asian  Presenting complaint: Chest pain similar to a heart attack  Past Medical History: Hypertension  previous episodes of panic attacks  history of major depressive disorder  Subject arrived in the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She describes the pain as a squeezing type  similar to prior bouts of unstable angina  rating it as 7 out of 10  worsening over the past 2 hours. The pain radiates to her left arm and is associated with nausea and diaphoresis. She also reports of recent stressors  including her husband's sudden death just two weeks prior.  She has a history of hypertension  manages it with enalapril  and has a history of panic attacks. She also has a recorded diagnosis of major depressive disorder  for which she receives treatment with sertraline. The subject denied smoking  alcohol  or illicit drug use. Family history includes heart disease in her father  but otherwise  the family history is unremarkable. She does not have a previous myocardial infarction or other heart disorders.  The sudden onset of her symptoms  elevated blood pressure  and notable recent stressor give the suspicion of a 'broken heart syndrome' or takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Further investigation using echocardiography  cardiac enzymes  and coronary angiography will help confirm the diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,23,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Tanaka is a 76-year-old Japanese widow who resides with her adult daughter in a suburban area. She presented to the ER accompanied by her daughter early this morning complaining of severe chest pain that radiates to the arms and jaw  which started suddenly a few hours after she was informed of her son's unexpected death.   Her past medical history is significant for hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and hypercholesterolemia  all of which are well-controlled with medications. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcoholic drinks just occasionally in moderate amounts. There is no family history of congenital heart diseases  but her late husband had coronary artery disease.   She also informs the doctor that she had a similar episode of chest pain and breathlessness about 5 years ago  after her husband's death but was diagnosed with no definitive cause  as her angiogram showed no significant atherosclerosis at that time.   She further reports experiencing shortness of breath  palpitations  and some degree of anxiety since her son's death news. She denies fever  cough  or other systemic symptoms. She appears distressed and rather apprehensive.   Her daughter adds that Mrs. Tanaka  a former school teacher  has been living with significant life stressors since her retirement  grandson's immigrating to the U.S.  and most recently son's sudden death.   Given the sudden onset  the severe nature of her symptoms  her risk factors  and background stressors  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (or broken heart syndrome) was considered a potential differential diagnosis along with Acute Coronary Syndrome. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,24,"Patient Presentation  A 63-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain  similar in nature to angina  which started about an hour ago. She reports the pain as a crushing feeling in the mid-chest area radiating to her left arm. The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  for which she has been taking Lisinopril and Atorvastatin  respectively.   She describes her current pain as worse than any previous chest pain  rating it an 8 out of 10. Additionally  the patient confirms that she has been under significant emotional stress for the past week due to the death of her spouse. She denies any use of tobacco  alcohol or illicit drugs. She is a retired schoolteacher and lives alone.  On physical examination  her blood pressure is 170/90 mmHg  HR 110 beats/min  SpO2 94%  and respirations 20/min. There is no jugular venous distension  carotid bruits or peripheral edema. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation. The heart rate is rapid  but regular with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.   A 12-lead EKG reveals ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads V2-V4. In light of her symptoms  history  and EKG findings  she is diagnosed with probable Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Further diagnostic and therapeutic intervention occurs immediately  considering the condition's life-threatening nature and high mortality rate amongst untreated patients.   The patient's age  sex  and recent emotional stress correspond with the typical demographic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  which is most often seen in postmenopausal women and can be triggered by severe stress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,25,Patient Presentation:  A 69-year-old Caucasian female presents to the Emergency Department complaining of acute onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain started suddenly about an hour ago when she received disturbing news about the death of her close relative. The pain is described as a sharp  squeezing  and tight sensation in the mid-sternal area  radiating to her jaw and left arm  and is rated 8 out of 10 in intensity.   She has a past medical history significant for hypertension  controlled with losartan  and hyperlipidemia managed with atorvastatin. She denies any history of ischemic heart disease or family history of early cardiac deaths. She quit smoking 20 years prior and denies alcohol or drug abuse. She's had an increased level of psychological stress over the past few weeks since the deterioration of her relative's health.   On examination  she appears anxious  pale  and diaphoretic. Her vitals are as follows: heart rate 90 beats per minute  blood pressure 160/90 mm Hg  respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Cardiac examination reveals tachycardia with normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Lung fields are clear to auscultation  and the rest of the physical exam is within normal limits.  An electrocardiogram reveals ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads and blood tests show elevated troponin levels. Further workup including echocardiogram and coronary angiogram reveals apical ballooning of the left ventricle and the absence of significant coronary artery disease  respectively  leading to the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken-heart syndrome). The patient is admitted to the cardiology service for further management and observation. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,26,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Lee is a 68-year-old Asian woman living independently in a suburban neighborhood. She has a past medical history significant for controlled type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She has had no surgeries or major illnesses beyond these two issues. She has a 40-pack year smoking history and has been a widow for two years after a 45-year marriage.   She presents today to the ER with symptoms that began suddenly during a family arguing session earlier in the day. Mrs. Lee describes a heaviness in her chest with mild sharp  transient left-sided chest pain. This was associated with palpitations  feeling light-headed  and she experienced transient shortness of breath.   She has no recent history of trauma  no pressure or burning in her chest or other symptoms typically suggestive of a myocardial infarction  and she did not lose consciousness. At the time of examination  the patient was in moderate distress with a slightly elevated blood pressure. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed that showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads with no significant Q-waves  suggesting a possible diagnosing of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome'.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,27,A 68-year-old Caucasian female presents to the ER with chest pain and shortness of breath that began a few hours ago. The pain is sudden  severe  and radiating to her jaw. This is her first experience with this type of pain.   She experienced her husband's sudden death two weeks ago and has been struggling with the emotional stress since then.   Her past medical history is significant for treated hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She denies any previous cardiovascular disease  surgeries  or family history of cardiovascular disease  but does admit to being a former smoker. She regularly takes amlodipine and rosuvastatin. Social history reveals she is a retired school teacher  lives alone  and does not consume alcohol. She also indicates experiencing sleeping disturbances and decreased appetite following her husband's death.  Upon presentation  her blood pressure is mildly elevated at 150/90 mmHg  pulse is irregular at 100 beats per minute  and respiratory rate slightly increased to 22 breaths per minute. On examination  cardiac auscultation presents a normal rhythm without any murmurs  gallops or rubs. Chest examination is demonstrative of mild tachypnea but otherwise clear.   The preliminary EKG shows ST-segment elevations in the anterolateral leads  suspicious for an anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  upon further evaluation with cardiac catheterization  no significant blockages are found. Her Troponin I level is elevated while other laboratory findings are within normal ranges.  Given the recent emotional stress of her husband's death  the sudden onset of symptoms  EKG findings  and elevated cardiac enzymes without any obstructive coronary artery disease  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome) is considered. The case was further confirmed by an echocardiogram  which showed apical ballooning and systolic dysfunction typical of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,28,Patient Presentation:  Ms. A is a 68-year-old Asian female who presents to the Emergency Department with acute chest pain described as sharp  9/10 intensity  located in the central chest region and radiating towards her left arm. She states the pain onset was sudden and has lasted for approximately 2 hours. She was under significant emotional stress at the time of onset due to sudden death news of her brother. She denies any chest trauma  dyspnea  diaphoresis  dizziness  or loss of consciousness.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,30,A 68-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian woman presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain. The pain began earlier in the day  approximately two hours after she received news of her husband's sudden death. The somatic distress has been persistent  radiating to her left arm  and is associated with shortness of breath. On a pain scale from 1 to 10  she describes it as an 8. Her medical history is notable for hypertension controlled with a calcium channel blocker and a low dose of a thiazide diuretic.  She is a non-smoker  does not consume alcohol  is moderately active  and has no known drug allergies. Her family history includes significant cardiovascular disease  her father died of a heart attack in his early 70s  and her younger brother has recently been diagnosed with ischemic heart disease. She has managed her stress and her grief in the past through counseling and significant familial and communal support.  On examination  her blood pressure is 155/90 mm/Hg  and her heart rate is 110 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation reveals tachycardia. No murmurs or other abnormal sounds are present. Her lungs are clear  with no signs of congestion.   The clinical presentation and stressful event history lead to a strong suspicion of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The necessary diagnostic tests  including cardiac biomarkers and echocardiogram  are planned to confirm the diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,31,Subject is a 70-year-old Caucasian female who presents to the emergency department with reports of feeling chest discomfort and shortness of breath which started a few hours ago. Patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension  for which she takes medication  but no known history of coronary artery disease or any other heart condition. She lost her husband two months ago and states she has been under a great deal of emotional stress since then. She currently lives alone and has minimal support system. She denies tobacco  alcohol or illicit drug use. She has a family history of similiar heart conditions. The symptoms started suddenly while she was watching television  and have not improved with rest. She describes it as 'typical' chest pain  with pressure-like discomfort situated in the middle of her chest  radiating to her jaw. Her initial EKG shows changes consistent with an acute myocardial infarction  but later angiogram does not show significant blockages in the coronary arteries. Echocardiogram shows a peculiar pattern of heart muscle contraction  with the base contracting normally but the middle and tip of the heart ballooning out  which are characteristic indicators of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,32,A 68-year-old Asian female presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain. The onset was sudden  occurring after she received the news of her son’s unexpected death. She described the pain as 'pressure'  rating it 8 out of 10. The pain was primarily located in the central chest area and radiated to her left shoulder.   The patient had a past medical history significant for hypertension and stage 2 chronic kidney disease. She was on medication for both conditions  specifically losartan for hypertension and she was adhering to a kidney-friendly diet for her CKD. She included that she did not smoke  consume alcohol  or use illicit drugs. Family history was notable for ischemic heart disease in her father and sister.  In the ER  her blood pressure was 160/95  heart rate was 110  respirations were 22  and her oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior precordial leads. Her lab results displayed elevated troponin levels  low-normal kidney functions  and normal cholesterol levels.   A subsequent echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization demonstrated left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning  but no coronary artery disease. Based on these findings  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,33,Patient Presentation:   Ms. A  a 68-year-old Asian woman  presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started about an hour ago. She rates her pain as an 8 on a scale of 10  describing it as a crushing sensation. She is known to have hypertension  which is well-controlled on medication. Her medical history also reveals that she has been suffering from depression and anxiety since her husband passed away two years ago.  Recently  she has been undergoing several stressful life events  which include her planning to move to a new city and handling legal issues related to her late husband's estate.  Physical examination reveals her blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg  heart rate is 110 beats per minute  and respirations are 22 breaths per minute. On auscultation  her heart sounds are normal  but her lung sounds reveal some crackles at the bases. Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrates ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads.  Her laboratory tests show slightly raised cardiac troponin levels. However  the coronary angiogram reveals no significant coronary artery disease  which rules out the possibility of acute myocardial infarction. The echocardiogram shows apical ballooning with a hyperdynamic base of left ventricle  suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.    She has no personal or family history of drug or alcohol abuse. She is allergic to penicillin and takes a daily dose of a calcium channel blocker for her hypertension. She is retired from her job as a primary school teacher and lives alone in her own house. She has two adult daughters who live nearby and visit her frequently. Her only other medications include multivitamins and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for her depression and anxiety.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,34,Patient Presentation: A 72-year-old Asian woman arrives at the emergency department with complaints of severe  sudden-onset chest pain radiating to her left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath and sweating. She conveys that these symptoms were brought on by severe emotional distress and feelings of terror after a traumatic incident; her husband of 50 years died suddenly a week ago.   Past Medical History: The patient is a non-smoker and moderate alcohol drinker. She has a history of hygiene hypertension adequately managed with medication for the past decade. However  reports medication non-compliance in the past week due to the traumatic event. She was diagnosed with depression three years ago and has been on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) since then. She also has a history of hyperlipidemia  but her last lipid panel six months ago was within normal limits presumably due to her compliance with diet and medication recommended by her Primary Care Physician. She is not diabetic and has no known allergies.   Family History: Her father had coronary artery disease and her mother had hypertension and diabetes mellitus. She has one sister who is healthy and two brothers  one diagnosed with hypertension and the other one deceased due to lung cancer. Because of this  she has been generally health-conscious.  This patient's demographic characteristics and past medical history are generally aligned with the typical profile of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients who are predominantly post-menopausal women with recent severe emotional stress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,35,Patient Presentation:   Ms. S.  a 68-year-old Asian female  presents to the emergency department. She complains of acute onset severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  which started about an hour ago while she was at her husband's funeral. She reports associated shortness of breath and a feeling of impending doom. She denies associated symptoms like nausea  vomiting  or palpitations.  Her past medical history reveals that she has a history of hypertension  for which she regularly takes a calcium channel blocker and a thiazide diuretic. She denies any history of smoking  alcohol  or drug abuse and has never been diagnosed with diabetes or lipoprotein disorders.   Her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with her mother passing away from myocardial infarction at the age of 72  and her older brother diagnosed with coronary artery disease in his mid-60s.   On physical examination  she appears anxious and in distress. Vital signs at presentation: BP - 180/100 mmHg  HR - 110/min  RR - 24/min  Temperature - 98.2 F  SpO2 - 92% on room air. She has clear lung sounds and regular heart beats with no abnormal sounds.   On further investigation  EKG shows ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads and Troponin levels are slightly elevated which might indicate acute coronary syndrome. However  subsequent catheterization revealed no significant coronary artery stenosis  leading more towards a suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy also known as broken heart syndrome  commonly seen in postmenopausal females undergoing significant emotional stress. An echocardiogram and cardiac MRI will be needed to confirm.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,36,"Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old Caucasian woman  named Margaret  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to her left arm along with shortness of breath since morning. She describes it as a pressure sensation  reminiscent of an elephant sitting on her chest. The symptoms have been coming and going  lasting few minutes each time but have been continuous for the past hour.  Margaret is a retired school teacher who lives with her husband. She is an active woman  non-smoker. She is a moderate alcohol consumer  with wine most evenings. Her maternal aunt has a history of heart disease.   She has been relatively healthy throughout her life  with only a diagnosis of hypertension controlled with a low dose of an ACE-inhibitor. She says that she takes her antihypertensive medication as prescribed. She recently had normal results from a lipid panel  and had a negative workup for ischemic heart disease last year  including normal stress testing and coronary angiogram.   Significant notes in her social history include the recent death of her son to suicide 6 weeks ago. She appears to be grieving and mentions that she has been feeling high levels of stress and has difficulty sleeping recently.   Upon examination  Margaret looks anxious and is in obvious discomfort. Her blood pressure is 165/95  pulse 120  regular  respiratory rate 22  and temperature 98.0 F. Her cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythm without any undue heart sounds. Lung fields are unremarkable without any crackles or wheezes. She has no peripheral edema.  Given these observations  a suspicion for takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome""""  is raised. Further testing with an electrocardiogram (ECG)  blood tests to measure cardiac enzymes  an echocardiogram  and coronary angiogram are planned to confirm this diagnosis."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,37,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Hernandez  a 68-year-old Hispanic woman  presents to the Emergency Department with severe  crushing chest pain of sudden onset  radiating to the left arm and jaw. It feels like an immense pressure  accompanied by shortness of breath  palpitations  and lightheadedness.   She has a medical history of hypertension and type II diabetes  both controlled with medication. She also suffered a bereavement a week ago  with the loss of her husband  which has caused profound emotional distress.  The clinical features and temporal nature of the symptoms raise suspicion for cardiac origin  specifically takotsubo cardiomyopathy  given the recent emotional stressor. Further cardiac investigation is required to confirm the diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,38,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Williams  a 67-year-old Asian female  presents to the emergency department. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially. She reports experiencing severe chest pain and shortness of breath since her husband suddenly died last week. The pain first started suddenly about an hour ago  radiating to her left arm and up to her neck. She rates it as 8 out of 10 in severity  worsening with activity.  She has a past medical history significant for hypertension  for which she takes lisinopril  and major depressive disorder  for which she is prescribed escitalopram. She has no known drug allergies. There is a family history of heart disease  with her father having a heart attack in his 50s.  Upon physical examination  she appears distressed and diaphoretic. She is tachycardic with an irregular pulse  and her blood pressure is elevated. A 12-lead ECG shows ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Lab tests reveal a slight increase in troponin levels.  Given the recent bereavement and the presentation mimicking an acute coronary syndrome  but without significant coronary artery disease found on angiography  the provisional diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken-heart syndrome) is made. The diagnosis is later confirmed with echocardiography showing apical ballooning of the left ventricle.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,39,Patient Presentation: A 72-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain radiating to her left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath. She reports the symptoms started approximately 3 hours ago while she was attending the funeral of her late husband. She also complains of palpitations and dizziness.  Past Medical History: She has a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  taking amlodipine and atorvastatin  respectively. She has no history of angina  myocardial infarction or other heart diseases. She quit smoking 20 years ago and consumes alcohol occasionally.  Social History: The patient is a retired school teacher  lives alone after her husband's recent death. She has two adult children who live out of state.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,40,"Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Harriet Thompson Age: 69 years  Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher Living Situation: Lives alone  Chief Complaint: Mrs. Thompson presents to the emergency room with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath. She describes the chest pain as severe  similar to """"a heavyweight is placed on my chest."""" She also experienced fatigue over the last few days.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Thompson has a history of hypertension  for which she is on antihypertensive medication. She has no known history of cardiac disease. She also has a history of generalized anxiety disorder and is on anxiolytic medication.  Family History:  Her mother had a stroke in her late 70s. Her father died in his early 80s due to heart failure  and her paternal aunt died of breast cancer. She has one sister with type 2 diabetes.  Personal and Social History:  Mrs. Thompson is a widow for the past three years. She quit smoking 15 years ago and drinks alcohol occasionally. She lives alone and does yoga for her fitness. She recently underwent immense emotional stress after her only son moved out of the country.  Note: The presentation is characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition observed predominantly in postmenopausal women and often triggered by emotional or physical stress. The chest pain and shortness of breath experienced by Mrs. Thompson may be due to the left ventricle's transient dysfunction in this condition. The patient’s recent emotional stressor could be the trigger point for the onset of her symptoms. This requires immediate medical intervention and would necessitate further investigation  including echocardiogram and cardiac enzymes  to rule out other conditions such as acute myocardial infarction  which may present similarly. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,41,Patient Presentation:  A 69-year-old Japanese-American female presents to the emergency department with a 2-hour history of severe chest pain. She describes her pain as a crushing sensation radiating down her left arm  resembling symptoms of a past heart attack she experienced 8 years prior. She also reports associated shortness of breath  nausea  and lightheadedness. She indicates a stressful incident happened at her home earlier in the day  that startled her and increased her anxiety level significantly.  She has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Past surgical history includes a hysterectomy over 20 years ago. Family history is significant for her father dying from a myocardial infarction at the age of 75. She denies tobacco  alcohol or illicit drug use. Current medications include lisinopril 10mg daily and simvastatin 20mg daily.   This patient's symptoms  past medical history  especially given the recent emotional stress are concerning for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  despite resembling symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. Further investigation  such as an EKG and echocardiogram  may help differentiate between the two.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,42,"Patient Information: A 68-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department alone.  Chief Complaint: """"Severe chest pain""""  History of Present Illness: The patient reports that she suddenly started experiencing intense chest pain around 2 hours previously  which she describes as a crushing sensation in her chest that radiates to her left arm. She also reports feeling short of breath. On further questioning  she reveals that her husband passed away suddenly 2 weeks ago  and she has been under immense emotional stress since then.  Past Medical History: - No history of hypertension or diabetes - Non-smoker - Prior to her husband's death  she led a rather active lifestyle with regular exercise - No prior history of cardiac diseases - Cholesterol level in the normal range  Family History: - Father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 70 - Mother died of stroke at the age of 72  Review of Systems: - No recent illnesses or infections - No history of illicit drug use  On physical examination  the patient appears anxious  in visible distress  and tachycardic.  Conclusion: The sudden emotional stress  typical chest pain  past medical  and family history is suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""). This condition is typically more common in post-menopausal women and can be precipitated by intense emotional or physical stress. Immediate further diagnostic and management action needs to be taken."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,43,"A 68-year-old  Caucasian female presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain that began suddenly approximately 2 hours ago. The patient described the pain as """"crushing"""" and centralized in the mid-sternal region. Associated symptoms included diaphoresis  nausea  and difficulty breathing. The patient noted that she had been under intense emotional stress  as her husband passed away unexpectedly just a week ago and she has been dealing with the aftermath ever since.  The patient's past medical history reveals hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which she has been taking amlodipine and atorvastatin  respectively. There are no previous known cardiac-related issues.  The patient has a 10 pack-year smoking history  though she quit 15 years ago. She denies illicit drug use. She also reports consuming alcohol socially  effectively averaging one drink per week.  Family history is notable for her father who had a myocardial infarction in his early 60s. The patient works as an elementary school teacher and lives alone since her husband's recent passing. She expressed concerns about the symptoms resembling those of a """"heart attack.""""  Her vitals are as follows: blood pressure 155/92 mmHg  pulse 110 bpm  respirations 22 rpm  temperature 37.1 degrees C  and O2 saturation 94% on room air. On physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. There was no pedal edema. Cardiac exam revealed tachycardia with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. ECG showed ST segment elevation in the anterolateral leads suggestive of a possible heart attack.  Based on her presentation and preliminary tests  she was admitted to the cardiac ICU for further management. Echocardiography and coronary angiography were scheduled. Despite the initial suspicion of a myocardial infarction  subsequent left ventriculogram revealed a distinctive apical ballooning pattern with preserved function at the base  suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient was commenced on appropriate medical management with ACE inhibitors  beta blockers and reassured about the often transient and reversible nature of this condition  but warned about potential complications."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,44,"Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Hiroko  a 72-year-old Japanese woman presents to the emergency department with severe  sudden onset chest pain radiating towards her left arm. The chest pain started a few hours ago after hearing the news of her grandson's sudden death. She denies any shortness of breath  nausea  vomiting  or palpitations. However  she reports feeling lightheaded and anxious.   Mrs. Hiroko is a widow who lives alone since her husband's death five years ago. She is a retired school teacher with a history of controlled hypertension and normal lipid levels. She is a non-smoker with no known history of coronary artery disease  and her only other significant medical issue is controlled depression for which she takes escitalopram. Her family history is positive for hypertension and stroke  but negative for genetic or congenital heart conditions.  On further interrogation  she confirms having had similar milder episodes of chest pain in the past year  which were also precipitated by periods of intense emotional stress  but she did not seek medical attention as she attributed them to anxiety and “aging”.   This episode  however  is significantly more painful and prolonged than previous ones  which prompted her to seek immediate medical assistance.   Physical examination shows mild distress related to chest pain. Vitals are blood pressure 160/95 mm Hg  pulse 90 bpm regular  respiratory rate 18/min and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The cardiac examination reveals normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs  rubs or gallops. EKG shows ST segment elevation in the anterior leads. Her chest x-ray is unremarkable.   In this clinical scenario  the sudden severe emotional stress leading to acute chest pain  her age  gender  ethnicity  and ECG findings are suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or “broken heart syndrome"""".   Management will include prompt initiation of heart failure treatment  emotional support and monitoring in a telemetry unit. She will also need an echocardiogram for confirmation of diagnosis and possible coronary angiography. Long-term management might involve beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors  as well as counseling or psychiatric intervention to help manage her stress and depression."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,45,A 70-year-old Caucasian female presented to emergency services with severe chest pain  radiating down her left arm  which began suddenly while she was attending her husband's funeral. The chest pain was accompanied by shortness of breath and dizziness. She has a history of hypertension  but no known coronary artery disease  diabetes  or smoking history. She is widowed as of today  retired  and lives with her adult daughter. Her medications include Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg once daily  started 3 years ago.  On physical examination  she appeared distressed  was diaphoretic  and exhibited a regular heart rate 105 beats per minute  blood pressure of 150/90 MM hg  respiratory rate of 20/minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. No murmurs  rubs  or gallops were detected on auscultation.   An ECG showed diffuse ST-segment elevation and QT prolongation. Lab results showed troponin I elevated at 2.5 ng/ml with a normal creatine kinase-MB fraction  indicating myocardial injury.   Based on her acute emotional stress  typical chest pain  electrocardiographic changes  transient left ventricular apical ballooning demonstrated by coronary angiogram (without significant coronary artery stenosis)  and elevated cardiac biomarkers  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome) was made. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,46,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Garcia  a 68 year-old Hispanic woman  presents to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started about 2 hours ago as she was attending her husband's funeral. The pain is described as constricting and is rated as a 7 on a scale of 0-10. It is not relieved by rest and the patient denies any radiation of pain. In the past  she has been in generally good health and denies any past history of heart disease.  On physical examination  she appears in obvious discomfort  pale and in mild distress. Her blood pressure is markedly raised at 167/96 mmHg  pulse rate is 110 beats per minute and respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia but is otherwise unremarkable.  The patient reports that she has been feeling emotionally strained since her husband's sudden death. She denied any habits like smoking or intaking alcohol. Family history revealed her mother had a myocardial infarction at the age of 75 years.  The classical chest pain  elevated blood pressure and triggering emotional stressor is quite suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'. However  differential diagnoses could include acute coronary syndromes and pulmonary embolism. Further investigations including ECG  troponin testing  and echo-cardiogram are indicated at this point to confirm the diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,47,A 69-year-old African-American female presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  radiating to her left arm and jaw  with onset 2 hours ago. Associated symptoms include nausea  vomiting  breathlessness and bouts of lightheadedness. She has no known allergies. She denies smoking  illicit drug use  and only drinks alcohol occasionally.  Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both managed with medication (Lisinopril and Rosuvastatin). She recently lost her husband to cancer one month ago  and she has been reporting high stress and feelings of depression since the event.   She has no family history of early heart disease. On examination  she appears distressed  with pulse rate 116 beats per minute  blood pressure 155/95 mmHg  respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. Cardiac examination reveals tachycardia but no murmur or gallop. Lung fields are clear on auscultation. The rest of her physical exam is unremarkable. An EKG shows nondescript ST segment elevation. Initial labs including complete blood count  renal function  liver function were within normal limits  but her troponin level was slightly elevated. The differential diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome and stress cardiomyopathy or takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,48,A 68-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and anxiety disorder presents to emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath. These symptoms started unexpectedly after she received news of her adult son's death earlier in the evening. The pain is sharp and worst over the left side of her chest  constant  non-radiating  associated with palpitations and relieved partially by sitting forward. She states that she has never experienced such pain before.  She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially. As per the patient  her mother had early onset coronary artery disease.  Examination features include: her blood pressure is 150/95 mmHg  pulse rate is 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. She appears anxious and diaphoretic. Cardiac examination reveals tachycardia with regular rhythm and no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,49,A 68-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain that started an hour ago. She describes the pain as a pressure-like feeling and rates it as 8/10 in intensity. The pain is located in the center of her chest and radiates to her left arm.   Her past medical history is significant for hypertension  for which she takes Lisinopril  and major depressive disorder  controlled with Fluoxetine. She denies having any personal or family history of heart disease.   She lost her husband six months ago  which has likely worsened her depressive symptoms. In fact  she was at her weekly grief counseling session when she started experiencing the chest pain. She denies smoking  alcohol or illicit drug use. Her diet and exercise habits are described as balanced  with three well-rounded meals a day  moderate alcohol consumption  and a daily 30-minute walk.  This patient presentation suggests Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome. This condition is more common in postmenopausal women and can be triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. In this case  the loss of a loved one may have served as the emotional trigger for this patient. Notably  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can mimic symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome. Despite this  patients often have relatively preserved cardiac history  making this a challenging diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,50,"A 62-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of major depressive disorder presents to the emergency department. She appears distressed and reports experiencing severe chest pain  which she describes as being similar to """"a heavy weight pressing down"""" on her chest. The pain began suddenly when she received news about the death of her longtime friend about an hour ago. She also reports shortness of breath  palpitations  and lightheadedness. The patient denies any history of coronary artery disease. Current medications include Sertraline and occasional Lorazepam. She is a non-smoker and denies the use of any illicit drugs or excessive alcohol use. She has a family history significant for heart disease  her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 70.

She has a history of major depression and anxiety disorder for which she had been receiving psychotherapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The patient lived alone and recently the patient had been under significant psychosocial stress due to financial instability. She does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs.  Vital signs on admission showed blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg  the heart rate of 105 beats per minute  a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute  with oxygen saturation of 97% on room air  and a body mass index of 28. Physical examination was unremarkable except for a mildly irregular heartbeat on auscultation.  Based on her presentation  she was initially suspected to have an acute coronary syndrome; however  given her recent stressful life event  the lack of coronary artery abnormalities on angiography  and subsequent echocardiogram results showing apical ballooning - a picture consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy was formed.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,53,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Hernandez  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presents to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of chest pain  shortness of breath  and a feeling of severe anxiety. She reports that her symptoms began earlier this morning. The patient's chest pain is described as squeezing and located in the middle of her chest. She rates it as 8 out of 10 in severity  adding that it radiates to her left arm and is accompanied by nausea.   The patient's past medical history reveals that she has hypertension managed with lisinopril. She denies a history of coronary artery disease  diabetes  or any other cardiac conditions. Her family history is unremarkable for cardiovascular diseases. Also  she has never smoked and drinks alcohol occasionally.   Ms. Hernandez recently experienced a significant amount of stress following the death of her husband just two weeks ago. She reports no allergies to medications.   The patient lives alone. She is retired teacher and doesn't follow any specific exercise regimen. Her diet is not strictly controlled and she admits to not always eating healthily - partly due to lack of appetite following her recent bereavement.   On examination  her blood pressure is 165/90 mmHg  heart rate is 110 beats per minute  and O2 saturation is at 96% on room air. She appears anxious and distressed. Cardiac auscultation reveals no abnormal heart sounds but there is mild tachycardia. Lung sounds are clear.  Given her symptoms  an electrocardiogram (ECG) and Troponin levels are ordered urgently to rule out acute coronary syndrome. The ECG displays ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  consistent with an acute event. Laboratory results return with elevated Troponin levels. Given the initial presentation and investigation results  an acute cardiac event is suspected. However  she does not have any major risk factors for CAD other than her age and hypertension.   With her recent emotional stress  an echocardiogram is ordered to further investigate  taking into account the possibility of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The echocardiogram results show apical ballooning and systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle  which is consistent with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. She is admitted for further management by the cardiology team.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,54,Patient Presentation:  A 72-year-old Caucasian female presents to the ER with sudden onset chest pain radiating to the left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath. The pain started abruptly after receiving news of her husband's unexpected death. The patient describes the pain as similar to a 'heart attack' she experienced previously. On examination  she is anxious  diaphoretic  and appears acutely ill.  Her past medical history is significant for hypertension  and a previous myocardial infarction 2 years earlier  for which she underwent angioplasty and stenting. She is non-diabetic  non-smoker  and consumes alcohol in moderation. Her medications include aspirin  a statin  and a beta-blocker.  ECG on arrival shows ST-elevation in the precordial leads. An immediate cardiac enzyme test reveals mildly elevated Troponin levels. However  an emergency coronary angiography  initiated on the basis of suspected recurrent coronary artery disease  reveals no significant coronary artery blockage or plaque rupture.  The left ventriculography shows apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basal wall segments - suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This is further confirmed by echocardiographic findings.  The clinical picture is consistent with 'broken heart syndrome' or takotsubo cardiomyopathy  potentially precipitated by the intense emotional stress after the tragic news. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,55,A 69-year-old Caucasian female patient presents to the emergency department reporting severe chest discomfort and shortness of breath beginning approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. She describes the pain as a heaviness in her chest that radiates to her left arm and jaw.   She is a widow who lost her husband 6 months ago and reports having recently undergone a high level of emotional stress due to this bereavement. She has a medical history of hypertension  for which she takes losartan  and hypercholesterolemia managed with atorvastatin. She has no history of coronary artery disease or other cardiac conditions.   She is potentially post-menopausal  as the majority of cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy occur in post-menopausal women. She has no history of alcohol or tobacco use. Her family history indicates her father had myocardial infarction at the age of 70  and her mother lived up to 80 with no significant illness reported.  On initial physical examination  the patient appears anxious and distressed  she is diaphoretic  with a blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 22 rpm  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.  This patient's demographic and clinical presentation fits the typical profile for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is most common in older women and often triggered by severe emotional stress. Her chest pain and shortness of breath  combined with her hypertension and stress  make her a high suspicion case for this condition.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,56,A 68-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain and dyspnea. The patient reports that the symptoms started suddenly about two hours ago. She describes the chest pain as a feeling of pressure radiating down her left arm. She also has been feeling lightheaded and is almost short of breath.   Over the past week  she had been experiencing significant emotional stress due to the death of her husband. She has no history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia or diabetes. She does not smoke or consume alcohol.   On physical examination  her blood pressure is 110/78 mm Hg  heart rate is 96 beats per minute  respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Her lung fields are clear upon auscultation  and cardiovascular examination reveals soft S1 and S2 with no audible S3  S4  rubs  or murmurs.  Her electrocardiogram (EKG) initially displays transient ST-segment elevation followed by T wave inverted  which is highly suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Further work-up including coronary angiogram does not detection of any significant blockages  confirming the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her blood work shows mildly elevated cardiac enzymes.  This patient is thus exhibiting classic symptoms and risk factor (post-menopausal woman with a recent strong emotional stressor) consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,57,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. D  a 68-year-old Japanese female  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain and dyspnea. The chest pain started while she was attending a funeral earlier today  it is of severe intensity and crushing in nature. She also notes feeling light-headed and short of breath. The patient denies any past similar episode.  Her past medical history is relatively unremarkable with only treatment for osteoporosis and well-controlled hypertension in her medical record. She also has a notable history of generalized anxiety disorder  for which she has been taking an antidepressant. She states she does not smoke  rarely consumes alcohol  and leads a sedentary lifestyle.  Upon arrival  she was notably anxious while her blood pressure was measured to be slightly low  at 105/65 mmHg  and heart rate was elevated at 102 beats per minute. Her ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  initating clinical suspicion for an acute myocardial infarction.  The patient lives alone since her husband died 6 years ago. She reports struggling with anxiety exacerbated by acute interpersonal stressors. Her son suggests that she has not been the same since the death of her husband. Today  while attending a funeral of an old friend  she complained of chest pain and felt light-headed  following which she was brought to the emergency department.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,58,Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old Asian female presents to the emergency department reporting severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  associated with shortness of breath  nausea  and sweating. The symptoms appeared suddenly around 2 hours ago  following news of her son's sudden death.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension for the past 10 years  which is well controlled with medication. She also reports occasional migraine episodes over the past couple of years.  Contributing Factors:  The patient experienced an extreme emotional stress event just prior to the onset of her symptoms. She does not smoke or consume alcohol  and there's no family history of coronary artery disease. However  her eldest sister has a history of Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy  which was triggered by the sudden death of her husband.   Medication History:  The patient takes Lisinopril 10 mg once daily for hypertension and Sumatriptan as needed for migraine. She has no known drug allergies.  Social History:  She is a retired teacher  widowed  and lives with her eldest daughter who provides support. She reports having a good social support network.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,59,A 68-year-old Asian woman presents to the Emergency Department. She describes sudden onset of severe chest pain that started about an hour ago. The pain is severe and radiating to her left arm. She also reports accompanying nausea and difficulty in breathing. She denies injury or trauma  but she mentions that she experienced intense emotional stress following a family dispute earlier in the day.   The patient’s past medical history is not significant for any cardiovascular illness. She has been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder for the past 10 years for which she has been on an SSRI. She denies any history of smoking or illicit drug use  although she confesses to be a moderate drinker. Her maternal family history is remarkable for early myocardial infarctions.  Physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  heart rate of 100 bpm  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. She appears visibly anxious and in distress. Her extraordinary anxiety  coupled with her chest pain  raises concern for an acute cardiovascular event. EKG  echocardiography and troponin levels are ordered immediately to evaluate for acute myocardial infarction. However  the results show classic signs of takotsubo cardiomyopathy with apical ballooning and contraction abnormalities of the left ventricular wall. Her coronary angiography is normal  ruling out the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease.   The diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is made based on her presentation and investigative findings. The cause is likely to be secondary to severe emotional stress that the lady experienced.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,60,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. Ortiz is a 72-year-old Latina woman who presents today with complaints of severe  sharp chest pain that began acutely 2 hours ago while learning the death of her grandson. The pain has a heavy  crushing quality  and she has also experienced marked shortness of breath. Ms. Ortiz denies any associated symptoms and has had no previous instances of chest pain.   Past Medical History:  Ms. Ortiz has a history of well-controlled hypertension  for which she takes Lisinopril 10mg once daily. She also has untreated major depressive disorder for which she had been reluctant to seek treatment despite encouragement from her family and primary care physician. Besides her hypertension and depression  she has had a largely unremarkable medical history and she reports no history of smoking  alcohol abuse  or illicit drug use.  Surgical History:  Ms. Ortiz underwent a total hysterectomy at the age of 45 due to fibroids  but has had no other major surgical interventions.  Family History:  She reports her father died at 65 from a myocardial infarction and her mother died of breast cancer in her 60s. She has a brother with diabetes mellitus type-2.  Review of Symptoms:  Physical examination is largely normal. Besides chest pain and dyspnea  Ms. Ortiz also reports difficulty sleeping  lowered appetite  and feelings of intense sadness due to her recent family loss.   Recent Literature Review:  A literature review of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known """"Broken Heart Syndrome """" reveals a significant over-representation in post-menopausal women  typically precipitated by severe emotional stress  with physical stress also being a contributing factor. Although the initial symptoms mimic that of a myocardial infarction  tests typically reveal no evidence of coronary artery obstruction. The condition tends to develop in people more than 50 years of age. Ms. Ortiz's presentation is consistent with these findings."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,61,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Lopez  a 68-year-old Hispanic female  presents to the emergency department with complaints of severe  sudden onset of chest pain that radiates to her left arm. She also reports associated symptoms of shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and feeling light-headed. She denies any recent trauma  fever  cough  or dysuria.   Her medical history is significant for well-controlled type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and a history of depression that worsened following the recent loss of her spouse. She has also been under significant stress of late due to ongoing financial concerns. She quit smoking 10 years ago and denies any history of illicit drug use.  Her vitals on presentation are: Blood Pressure- 165/90mmHg  Heart rate- 110/min  Respiratory rate- 24/min  Oxygen saturation- 92% on room air. Electrocardiogram reveals ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. An echocardiogram subsequently reveals a characteristic 'apical ballooning' suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   She does not report any family history significant for cardiac diseases. She is currently on Metformin for her diabetes and Lisinopril for her hypertension. She admits adherence to her medication regimen has been challenging since her spouse's passing due to elevated stress and poor mood.   Detailed examination and workup are planned to manage and assess the severity of her condition  with mental health support also being recommended due to the possible emotional triggers linked with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,62,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. Linda is a 75-year-old Asian woman who hails from the urban area of Seattle  Washington  and is recently widowed. She has no significant past medical history  except for hypercholesterolemia  which has been treated with statins for the last five years. She does not have any personal or family history of heart disease and she is not a known diabetic. She was brought to the emergency room by her son after experiencing sudden onset  severe chest discomfort while hearing news about her daughter's grave illness.   The symptoms started around 4 hours prior to reaching the emergency room. According to her son  she was emotionally upset after receiving the news and has never experienced such discomfort before. The chest pain she described was mostly central and radiating up to the left side of her neck  saying it felt like """"something heavy sitting on her chest."""" It was associated with shortness of breath  nausea  and profuse sweating. She denies any headache  palpitations  or loss of consciousness. She has never smoked and does not consume alcohol.   On examination  she appeared anxious and pale. She was experiencing rapid breathing  with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute  a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  her pulse was regular and her blood pressure was recorded as 155/95 mmHg. O2 saturation was maintained at 94% on room air. No abnormal cardiac  chest  or abdominal sounds were noted. Examination of other systems did not reveal any abnormalities."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,63,Patient Presentation  Mrs. Fuentes is a 66-year-old Hispanic female presenting to the emergency room with severe chest pain and associated dyspnea. The pain started suddenly about an hour ago and has persisted  not alleviated by rest. She describes the pain as a squeezing and tight feeling in her chest  rating it as a 10/10 on the pain scale.   She has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which she takes Lisinopril and Simvastatin  respectively. She does not smoke or drink alcohol  and her BMI is within the normal range. She reports being under a significant amount of emotional stress  as her husband of 40 years recently passed away.  On examination  she appeared anxious and fatigued. She was mildly tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 bpm and blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg.  Based on her symptoms  history  age  and stress factors  a tentative diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as Broken Heart Syndrome  is made. An urgent EKG and echocardiography are ordered to confirm the diagnosis. She also needs cardiac enzymes tested to rule out a myocardial infarction.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,64,Patient Presentation  A 67-year-old Caucasian woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset  severe chest pain radiating to her left arm and jaw  similar to the pain experienced during myocardial infarction. This pain was triggered by an intense fight with her family. She has occasional episodes of shortness of breath  and feelings of terror or impending doom. Past medical history revealed that the patient was living alone after the death of her husband 5 years ago and was diagnosed with major depressive and anxiety disorders 2 years ago. Moreover  it was found that the patient has hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  for which she takes regular medications. She had no prior history of coronary artery disease  and never smoked or consumed alcohol. She leads a life with moderate physical activity and has a history of intermittent non-specific chest pain  particularly during intense emotional stress. She underwent menopause at the age of 52. Her mother suffered from coronary artery disease. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,65,Patient Presentation:  A 72-year-old Japanese American woman with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency room. She describes experiencing sudden  severe chest pain localized in the middle of her chest. The pain began shortly after she received news of her husband's unexpected death earlier in the day. Her physical examination reveals tachycardia and mild hypertension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevations and T-wave inversions  which may simulate an acute coronary syndrome. Troponin levels are also elevated.   With a high clinical suspicion and given the fact that her symptoms started immediately following a stressful event  the patient is subjected to coronary angiography. Angiography does not show any significant coronary artery disease. Left ventriculography instead shows a surprising finding: the base of the left ventricle is contracting normally  but the mid-portion and the apex of the heart are ballooning out during systole  giving rise to the characteristic 'octopus trap' appearance. Pulmonary and cardiac exam findings are consistent with acute heart failure  with bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation and an S3 heart sound.   The symptoms  EKG findings  elevated troponins  characteristic imaging findings  and triggering emotional stress strongly suggest the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.    Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension 2. No prior history of ischemic heart disease 3. Non-smoker and moderate alcohol intake 4. No significant family history of premature cardiovascular disease.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,66,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female presenting to the ER with sudden  severe chest pain. She states the pain feels like a heavy pressure in the center of her chest radiating down her left arm. She also reports feeling slightly short of breath. The onset of symptoms was sudden and occurred following an argument with her family an hour ago. She has no known history of heart disease but has a history of hypertension controlled with medication and a 25-year history of smoking. She has never had any such chest pain before. She lost her spouse a year ago and lives alone since then. She had an episode of major depressive disorder following her husband's death. She does not take any illicit substances and drinks alcohol socially. She denies any palpitations  syncope  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  orthopnea  cough  or fever. Family history is positive for coronary artery disease in her deceased husband but negative in her parents and siblings. Her vital signs are stable but she looks physically distressed due to the pain. Physical exam is remarkable for a slightly elevated heart rate and an S4 gallop on auscultation. Considering her intense emotional stress  sudden onset anginal pain and differential diagnosis of coronary artery spasm versus takotsubo's cardiomyopathy  an immediate EKG and cardiac enzymes are ordered.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,67,A 65-year-old Hispanic female  named Maria  comes to the Emergency Department reporting chest pain that radiates to her left arm. She discloses that she is a retired teacher and lives alone. She states that her symptoms began suddenly earlier in the day during an argument with her adult son and have been steady since. Maria rates her pain as an 8 out of 10 on the pain scale  stating that the discomfort feels like a heavy pressure. She also reports accompanying nausea and shortness of breath.   Maria has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She denies any history of heart disease or diabetes  but admits she has not been to a doctor in the last 5 years due to fear of receiving bad news. She also discloses that she recently lost her husband and has been under a great deal of emotional stress. She is a non-smoker and drinks red wine occasionally. Her paternal grandmother died of a heart attack at the age of 78  and her mother has diabetes.  Maria's vital signs show blood pressure 152/88 mmHg  heart rate 95 bpm  respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation levels are at 93% on room air  and body temperature 98.7°F. The clinic rushes to get an EKG  which reveals ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  mimicking an acute myocardial infarction. However  surprisingly  her cardiac enzymes are within normal limits. Given the patient's presentation  an emergent cardiac catheterization is planned to rule out an acute coronary syndrome. However  the test reveals no significant obstructions  but instead demonstrates apical ballooning of the left ventricle suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,68,A 72-year-old Caucasian woman presents to the emergency room with severe chest pain onset 30 minutes prior. She describes the pain as a sudden  tight  crushing sensation that radiates to her left arm and jaw. This is accompanied by difficulty breathing  profuse sweating  and a feeling of impending doom.   She has a significant past medical history including well-managed type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and osteoporosis. There is no record of any previous cardiovascular disease in her health records.   She is highly distressed as she just learned of her husband's sudden death this morning. Her functioning was completely normal until the shocking news.  Electrocardiogram (ECG) and troponin levels indicate myocardial injury; however  coronary angiogram does not show any significant coronary artery disease to explain her symptoms. A subsequent echocardiogram shows apical ballooning of the left ventricle (LV)  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  This patient's presentation aligns with the typical demographic profile of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which most frequently affects postmenopausal women  particularly after extreme emotional stress. The condition is also commonly associated with other underlying medical conditions.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,69,"Patient is a 76-year-old Caucasian female presenting with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath. She describes the chest pain as """"crushing"""" and rates it an 8/10. It began during a family gathering earlier today and she reports feeling extremely stressed during the event. The pain got worse when she tried to walk upstairs. She also reports experiencing increased fatigue over the past few days.  In terms of past medical history  she is hypertensive and has a history of major depressive disorder. She is a nonsmoker and rarely consumes alcohol. Her medications include Lisinopril  Amlodipine  and Fluoxetine. She has no known drug allergies. She lives alone but has a close-knit family who resides nearby. She recently lost her husband about 6 months ago.  On examination  the patient appears anxious. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 160/90  pulse rate 98  respiratory rate 22  and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Cardiac exam is notable for tachycardia and a normal S1 and S2. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No peripheral edema is noted. Electrocardiogram shows ST-segment changes and her troponin levels are elevated. There is a clear suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy given the presentation  history of extreme emotional stress  and it is more prevalent among postmenopausal women. Additional diagnostic testing like echocardiogram or cardiac angiography will be required to confirm the diagnosis. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,70,"Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute chest pain radiating to her left arm and shortness of breath  which started abruptly a few hours ago. The pain is described as crushing in nature and 7/10 in intensity. It is associated with nausea and sweating. The patient is clearly distressed and seems pale.  Patient's family history revealed that her mother died from myocardial infarction. The patient is a widow and lives alone. She has been mourning her husband's recent sudden death for the past three weeks and has been under immense emotional stress.  The patient is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which she takes lisinopril and atorvastatin respectively. She has no known drug allergies.  Her vital signs upon arrival were: Blood pressure 155/95 mmHg  Heart rate of 106 bpm  Respiratory rate 20 bpm  and Oxygen Saturation 95% on room air. On physical examination  she looks anxious  diaphoretic and in distress. Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia without any murmurs  rubs or gallops.  Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Cardiac enzymes are ordered immediately to rule out acute myocardial infarction.   Given the patient's sudden onset of symptoms after significant emotional stress  history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  her clinical presentation with chest pain  and EKG changes  takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" is highly suspected."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,71,A 70-year-old African-American woman presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain. The pain radiates to her jaw and left arm  and is accompanied by overwhelming fatigue  profuse sweat  and dyspnea. Her past medical history includes hypertension controlled with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  type 2 diabetes managed with Metformin  and she recently underwent hip replacement surgery. She denies any regular alcohol or tobacco use.  Over the past three months  she has had several stressful events - the death of her husband and the subsequent financial difficulties have caused significant emotional distress. On examination  her blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg  heart rate is 110 beats/min  and her respiratory rate is 22 breaths/min  SpO2 94% on room air.   The electrocardiogram reveals non-specific T-wave changes but no ST-segment changes typically noted in an acute myocardial infarction  raising concerns for possible takotsubo cardiomyopathy (stress-induced cardiomyopathy). Next steps involve further diagnostic testing  including cardiac enzymes and an echocardiogram  to clarify the diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,72,A 68-year-old Caucasian female is admitted to the emergency department with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath that have lasted for a few hours. She describes the pain as throbbing and central  radiating towards the left side of her neck. She rates it an 8 on the pain scale. Despite rest and administration of nitroglycerin  the pain persists  accompanied by cold sweats and fatigue. In addition  she confirms experiencing some emotional labile behavior and anxiety symptoms recently  resulting from a bereavement situation following the sudden death of her spouse  which is uncontrolled.   Her medical history is positive for hypertension  dyslipidemia and osteoporosis. She is a non-smoker  drinks alcohol occasionally  and maintains a light exercise regimen with regular check-ups and good medication adherence.  The patient Background check reveals no history of myocardial infarction or CAD  and no family history of early heart disease. ECG reveals T-wave inversion in the precordial leads. Subsequent Coronary angiogram reveals patent coronaries  and echocardiography shows apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the base and hypo kinesis of the mid segments  highly indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   It's worth noting that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more frequent in postmenopausal women with a recent history of severe emotional stress  as is the case with our patient. It frequently mimics myocardial infarction symptoms but normal coronary angiography findings and transient left ventricular dysfunction distinguish this condition from myocardial ischemia.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,73,Patient Presentation:  RN  a 72-year-old Caucasian female  presents to the emergency department with sudden onset crushing chest pain  which she describes as similar to her previous myocardial infarction that occurred 6 years ago. The pain started 30 minutes ago when she received distressing news about her daughter's health  and has been steady since it started. She rates her pain as 8 on a scale of 0 to 10  with radiation to her left shoulder and arm. She is feeling short of breath and sweating profusely  but denies nausea  vomiting  or any other symptoms.   RN's past medical history is significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) 6 years ago  and osteoporosis. Her daily medications include aspirin 81mg  lisinopril 10mg  atorvastatin 20mg  alendronate once weekly  and calcium and vitamin-D supplements. She is allergic to penicillin  which causes her to break out in hives. She is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.   She lives alone since her husband passed away a year ago  but her children visit her frequently. She used to work as an administrative assistant and has been retired for 10 years. She enjoys reading books and going for walks in her free time.   Initial vital signs reveal blood pressure 160/100mmHg  heart rate 110 bpm  respiratory rate 20/min  temperature 98.4°F  and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Physical examination is unremarkable except for slight tachycardia and diaphoresis. She appears anxious and is in visible distress due to chest pain.  Based on the history of present illness and past medical history  takotsubo cardiomyopathy  sometimes called broken-heart syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy  is included in the differential diagnosis. RN is at higher risk for this condition due to her post-menopausal status  high-stress situation related to the news about her daughter's health  and presence of cardiovascular risk factors.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,74,"Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old Caucasian female presented to the ER with severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  having occurred post intense psychological stress of losing her spouse. The patient reports this pain as """"crushing""""  8/10 in severity and has been experiencing it for the past 2 hours. She associated this pain with shortness of breath  diaphoresis and mild nausea. She denies having any similar episodes in the past. Issue arose suddenly  while she was at home. Symptoms prompted her to seek immediate medical attention. Social history revealed that she is retired  widow  living alone and is a non-smoker.  Her past medical history is notable for hypertension which is being treated with lisinopril. She also has a history of major depression which she has been treated for using sertraline. She does not have any personal or family history of cardiac disease.   On examination  she appeared anxious with diaphoresis and tachycardia. Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia with normal rhythmic heart sounds and no murmurs. Chest was clear on auscultation. Rest of the examination was uneventful.   Provisional diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome was made and the patient was immediately started on MONA protocol (Morphine  Oxygen  Nitroglycerin and Aspirin) as a standard of care. However  eventual investigations including echocardiography showed findings typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'Broken Heart syndrome'. Her Troponin-I level was moderately elevated while her coronary angiogram did not show any significant obstruction. Echocardiogram revealed significant hypokinesis in mid septal and apical regions leading to balloon appearance of the heart - pointing towards Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Patient’s condition stabilized with medical management and she was suggested to get counselling to manage her bereavement related stress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,75,"Patient Presentation:   Mrs. A is a 69-year-old Asian woman who presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain started suddenly this afternoon while she was attending the funeral of her husband  describing it as a heaviness in her chest that radiates to her left arm. She reports associated symptoms of nausea  dizziness  and palpitations.   Mrs. A is a nonsmoker with a past medical history significant for hypertension that is well controlled on Lisinopril. She denies any history of coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular issues. She had been living independently and very active despite some anxiety issues since her husband fell ill last year. She describes her stress level as """"extremely high"""" due to her recent bereavement.  On physical examination  she was noted to be anxious and diaphoretic with a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. An initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  differential diagnosis at this point was an acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction  however  she had a normal lipid profile. Cardiac biomarkers were only marginally elevated. Subsequent coronary angiography did not show any significant coronary artery obstructions that could account for her symptoms.   The left ventriculography showed systolic apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesis  a pattern typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   She had been under tremendous emotional stress due to the loss of her husband  which led to the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken-heart syndrome"""". This condition is typically seen in postmenopausal women and can be triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,76,Patient Presentation:  A 70-year-old Japanese female presents herself at the emergency department in acute distress. She reports sudden and severe chest pain  analogous to that experienced in a heart attack. The pain started around an hour back while she was trying to cope up with the sudden demise of a very close family member. Her medical history is relevant for hyperlipidemia and Type II diabetes mellitus  both of which are well controlled with medication. However  she has no history of cardiac disease. She is a nonsmoker and doesn't drink alcohol frequently.  Her family history is significant as her mother succumbed to heart disease at an early age. She also maintains a diet with moderate sodium and tries to engage in regular physical activity such as walking. On assessment  her blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg  heart rate is irregular and slightly tachycardic and her respiratory rate is increased with a poignant decrease in her oxygen saturation on room air.   An electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevation and her cardiac biomarkers were slightly elevated indicating some degree of myocardial injury. However  she has no history of preceding typical angina. Considering her demographic  medical history  presentation and initial tests murmuring towards a cardiac event  a potential diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy also known as 'Broken Heart Syndrome' is suspected. This oriental post-menopausal female's intense emotional stress could have triggered a surge of stress hormones leading towards a temporary weakening of her heart muscle.  The coroner team is alerted for an urgent coronary angiogram to confirm the diagnosis and rule out acute coronary syndrome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,77,"A 68-year-old  Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain and mild shortness of breath. The pain began roughly 2 hours ago and is not improving with rest. On review of systems  she reports no nausea  vomiting  diaphoresis  or syncope.   Her medical history is notable for hypertension and high cholesterol  managed with lisinopril and atorvastatin. She has no history of coronary artery disease  myocardial infarction  or heart failure.  The patient reveals that she began experiencing these symptoms a few hours after she received news about the unexpected death of her sister. The patient's husband  who accompanied her  recounts that her sister’s death has greatly affected her and seems to have triggered her symptoms. There is no recent history of heavy lifting  extreme physical exertion  or illicit drug use. She denies smoking and consumes alcohol only in moderation.  Upon physical examination  the patient appears mildly distressed due to the pain. Vital signs are as follows: heart rate 110 beats/minute  blood pressure 150/90 mmHg  respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Her heart exam reveals tachycardia but is otherwise normal with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. The rest of the examination is unremarkable.   Given the patient's symptoms and potential emotional trigger  a preliminary diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (referred to as """"broken heart syndrome"""") is considered. An electrocardiogram  cardiac biomarkers  echocardiogram  and ultimately  coronary angiography are ordered to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out acute myocardial infarction. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,78,A 68-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with severe central chest pain contrasting to her occasional episodes of angina. Patient complains of feeling short of breath and light-headed. She denies any recent drug or alcohol use.   Her medical history is significant for hypertension and anxiety  both of which are controlled with medication; however  she has no known history of coronary artery disease. Her family history reveals her father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 55.   She also reports a recent significant emotional stressor  as she recently lost her husband. She is a widow  previously a housewife  with three grown children. She denies any smoking  but admits to being a social drinker. She is currently taking amlodipine for her hypertension and alprazolam for her anxiety disorder.  On examination  her blood pressure is 145/89 mmHg  pulse rate 110 beats/minute  respiratory rate of 24 breaths/minute  and her oxygen saturation is 97% in room air. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,79,A 72-year-old Caucasian woman presents with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath. She reports increased stress and anxiety over the past week due to the recent death of her husband. She has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperthyroidism  both well-controlled with medication. She has a 20-year history of smoking  though she quit five years ago. She denies any history of myocardial infarction  diabetes mellitus  or any remarkable family medical history. The patient does not consume alcohol and follows a balanced diet.  On examination  her blood pressure is 150/90mmHg  pulse 95 per minute  regular  and respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds without any murmurs or rubs. No adventitious lung sounds are heard.    The patient's ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation. On further evaluation with an echocardiogram she is diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  as findings reveal a characteristically low ejection fraction  with apical ballooning of the left ventricle in systole but without obstructive coronary disease on angiography.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,80,Patient Presentation:  Ms. L is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who presents to the emergency department with acute-onset chest discomfort  shortness of breath  palpitations  and nausea since 2 hours. The patient rates the chest discomfort as 8/10 in severity  describes it as a crushing-type sensation that is radiating to her left arm and neck. She further states that her symptoms began when she learned the sudden death of her close friend this morning.  Her past medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both under control with medication. The patient has been a non-smoker for the last 10 years. She does not drink alcohol. She denied any history of heart disease. The patient was also diagnosed with depression approximately 2 years earlier due to the death of her spouse and had been on anti-depressants.  In the emergency department  her vital signs showed a blood pressure of 148/92 mmHg  heart rate of 112 beats/minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. On examination  she appeared anxious and distressed. Cardiac auscultation revealed tachycardia without any added sounds.  The presentation is typical for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  given the demographics (older  post-menopausal female)  stressor (learning of the death of a close friend)  and presenting symptoms (chest pain  shortness of breath). An electrocardiogram and echocardiogram will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,81,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. A is a 68-year-old widowed Caucasian female  a retired school teacher  known case of hypertension and high cholesterol levels. She presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. The pain is described as squeezing in nature which woke her up from sleep and has been ongoing for the past 3 hours. She also reported experiencing similar but less severe episodes of chest pain within the past week. Additionally  she had associated nausea and shortness of breath with light-headedness  but no cough  fever  or palpitations. She seemed visibly distressed and tearful upon examination  and disclosed that her husband passed away about a month ago which has been causing her significant emotional stress.   In her past medical history  she is known to be hypertensive and has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. Both conditions are managed with medication  namely Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg once daily in the morning and Atorvastatin 20mg once at night respectively. Despite this  she admits that she has not been regular with her medications for the past month post her husband's demise. There is no known history of diabetes  renal diseases  smoking  or alcohol consumption.  Her father had passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 75. Her mother  who is 89  is living with Alzheimer's disease. Her sister  who is 65  is a known diabetic patient on insulin. There is no family history of cardiomyopathy.  On clinical examination  she is visibly anxious and stressed. Her blood pressure is 165/90 mmHg  pulse rate is 108/minute  respiratory rate is 22/minute  with a temperature of 98°F. On auscultation  heart sounds were normal  without murmurs  rubs  or gallop rhythm. Pulmonary examination was clear with no crackles heard on auscultation. Her peripheral pulses were palpable and equal bilaterally with no significant pitting edema observed.   Given her presentation and past medical history  she was admitted for further investigations and management with a working diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome or """"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy"""" - a condition known to predominantly affect post-menopausal women who experience intense emotional or physical stress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,82,"Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old Caucasian female presents to the Emergency Department with sudden severe chest pain  radiating to the left arm. She describes the pain as a """"heavy  squeezing feeling"""" reminiscent of past angina episodes. She also reports feeling short of breath  with an associated rapid heartbeat and light-headedness.   She has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both treated with medication for the past 10 years. She also has a history of major depressive disorder controlled with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). She does not smoke or consume alcohol.   This patient has been recently bereaved  with her husband passing away suddenly two weeks ago. Since then  she has experienced increased psychological stress and reported symptoms of anxiety.  Family history reveals her mother had a myocardial infarction at age 70  and her father had a stroke at age 69. Her only sibling  a brother  has managed type 2 diabetes.  The patient  a retired elementary school teacher  enjoys knitting and baking in her free time. She lives alone in her own apartment  while her daughter lives nearby and provides her with emotional and logistical support.   These details suggest strong possibilities for diagnosing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" particularly given the emotional trauma and stress she has been undergoing  combined with her symptoms that mirror those of acute coronary syndrome."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,83,"A 65-year-old Caucasian female presents in the emergency department with abrupt onset of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm along with shortness of breath. The pain is described as """"crushing"""" and began about 2 hours prior to arrival. She also reports feeling nauseous and sweaty. She has a history of controlled hypertension  for which she takes lisinopril. She indicates no history of cardiac diseases but notes that she doesn’t exercise regularly and has been a smoker up to 10 years ago.   She recently lost her long-term partner last week  which has been a severe emotional strain. Her family history includes her father who died of myocardial infarction at 67  and her mother who has type 2 diabetes mellitus.  On the physical examination  she appears anxious and pale. Blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minutes  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 93% on room air. On auscultation  there are no abnormal heart sounds or murmurs  and her lungs are clear. Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior precordial leads. Initial labs indicate elevated troponin levels.    This patient's presentation is highly suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy  given her recent emotional stressor  symptoms mimic acute coronary syndrome  and changes on ECG. However  coronary angiography would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,84,Patient Presentation: Ms. A is a 65 year-old Asian female who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe  sudden-onset chest pain. The pain began about an hour ago while she was at home. She describes it as a heavy  squeezing pain radiating down her left arm. She also reports associated shortness of breath  nausea and vomiting  and excessive sweating.   Past Medical History: Ms. A has a significant history of hypertension  controlled with medication. She also suffers from generalized anxiety disorder and has been recently dealing with increased life stress  including the recent death of her spouse.  Family History:  Her mother had coronary artery disease and her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. She does not smoke or consume alcohol.  Physical Examination: The physical examination reveals a woman appearing her stated age  in obvious discomfort. She is tachycardic  with a heart rate of 110  and her blood pressure is slightly elevated at 145/85. The rest of her vital signs are within normal limits. Her lungs are clear to auscultation  heart sounds reveal tachycardia with no added sounds or murmurs. Her physical examination is otherwise unremarkable.  The initial presentation and symptoms are suggestive of acute coronary syndrome  however  her EKG and troponin levels are inconsistent with a typical heart attack. Emergency cardiac catheterization reveals no significant blockages in the coronary arteries. An echocardiogram  however  reveals evidence of an apical ballooning and hypokinesia of the left ventricle  characteristic of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome. This diagnosis is supported by her recent traumatic life event  the loss of her partner  as emotional stress is a well-known trigger for this condition.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,85,Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old African American woman presents to the ER with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  shortness of breath  and profuse sweating. She denies any history of chest pain or similar episodes in the past. The chest pain started suddenly about 2 hours ago while she was at the funeral of her husband. She describes the chest pain as a heavy pressure sensation in the center of her chest. No associated symptoms of nausea  vomiting  or dizziness were reported by the patient.   Past Medical History:  She has a history of hypertension  diagnosed 10 years ago  and is well-controlled presently on oral medications. She also has a history of type II diabetes mellitus for the past 8 years  controlled on an oral hypoglycaemic agent. There is no history of cardiac disease  respiratory disease  migraines  or epilepsy in her past.  Social History:  The patient is a retired teacher  widowed  and lives alone. She admits to two to three cups of coffee daily and does not smoke or drink alcohol.  Family History:  Her father died of stroke at an age of 74 years and her mother suffered from breast cancer. She has two children  both in good health.  Overall  considering her presentation and stress-induced chest pain  she is showing signs consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,86,"Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain  severe shortness of breath and fatigue. The pain began suddenly during a highly stressful argument with her adult son. She describes the pain as a """"heavy pressure"""" feeling in her sternum  radiating to her left arm. Previously worked as a high school teacher  she is a widow with 3 adult children  living alone.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension for which she takes Losartan  and she quit smoking 10 years ago but smoked a pack a day for 25 years. She reports no known allergies. Family history reveals maternal myocardial infarction at age 72 and paternal stroke at age 76. She has no prior history of coronary artery disease or chest pain and did not undergo any major surgery.  On physical examination  the patient appears diaphoretic and in moderate distress due to pain. Vitals indicate tachycardia with a pulse of 112 bpm and blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg.  Based on her clinical presentation  age group  female gender  stressful event preceding symptoms and absence of past coronary artery disease  a differential diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is considered. This will be confirmed by ECG changes  elevated cardiac biomarkers  and distinctive left ventricular wall motion abnormalities in the absence of obstructive coronary disease on angiography."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,87,A 68-year-old female Japanese patient presents to the emergency room with severe chest pain  diaphoresis  dyspnea and nausea. The onset of her symptoms began 2 hours ago  following a family argument which caused her significant emotional distress. The chest pain is located in the center of her chest  is a pressure-like sensation  and radiates to her neck and left arm. She rates the pain as 10/10 on a pain scale.   Her medical history reveals hypertension for which she manages with antihypertensive medications. She has never smoked  drinks alcohol occasionally and leads a moderately active lifestyle. There is no known family history of heart disease  but her mother did have a stroke in her late 70s. The patient denies previous episodes of chest pain or other cardiac symptoms.   During assessment  she is visibly restless and anxious. Vital signs are blood pressure: 150/85 mmHg  pulse: 98 beats per minute  respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute  temperature: 98.2°F (36.8°C)  saturation: 95% on room air.  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more prevalent within postmenopausal women and those of East Asian descent due to genetic predisposition. The disease often presents in the wake of an emotional or physical stressor. Current presentation suggests takotsubo cardiomyopathy  but further diagnostic tests such as electrocardiogram  echocardiogram  and blood tests are needed to rule out other potential cardiac conditions  such as acute coronary syndrome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,88,A 68-year-old Caucasian female with a history of depression  hypertension and post-traumatic stress disorder presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain and dyspnea. The symptoms developed immediately following the news of her son's unexpected death. The pain is described as sharp in nature and radiates to her left arm. She also reports feeling lightheaded and developed sudden onset nausea.  She denies any smoking history or illicit drug use but admits to consuming alcohol socially. She was diagnosed with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder after a car accident five years ago and was started on fluoxetine. She is recently widowed and has been living alone for around one year. She takes amlodipine for hypertension.  This patient's presentation is characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  which frequently emerges in postmenopausal women under extreme emotional stress. The symptoms often mimic those of a typical myocardial infarction  hence the chest pain radiating to her left arm. Her depression and PTSD may also have contributive roles in her symptom development  as studies suggest a correlation between takotsubo syndrome and psychiatric disorders. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,89,"Patient Presentation  A 68-year-old Caucasian woman presents to the Emergency Department complaining of severe chest pain that radiated to her left arm  together with difficulty of breathing. The onset of these symptoms was sudden  starting approximately an hour ago while she was reading a piece of devastating news from her morning paper. She describes the pain as """"crushing """" rating it as a 9 on a scale of 10. She also reports accompanying symptoms such as a sense of impending doom  nausea and mild perspiration.      She has no remarkable past medical history  except for well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and occasional migraines. She is a non-smoker but admits to a glass or two of red wine on weekends. She lives alone following her husband's death last year and has two grown children living out of state. She practices yoga and relaxation techniques regularly as part of her holistic lifestyle.  Patient has a family history of early onset coronary artery disease  with her father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 52. Prior to today’s occurrence  patient had not presented any cardiac symptoms or suffered any major health issues.  Notably  the patient has recently experienced elevated levels of chronic stress and emotional strain following her husband’s death. She mentions she has been having struggles coping up with his loss which has led to feelings of anxiety and depression over the past few months.  Psycho-socially  her stress and depression are known trigger factors. Her relatively advanced age  female gender and Caucasian race align with the typical demographic features of patients with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy as reported in literature."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,90,Patient Presentation:  A 72-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with sudden onset  severe chest pain  and shortness of breath. The pain started approximately 2 hours ago  it is described as crushing in nature  radiating to the left arm  and associated with nausea and profuse sweating. She denies having any similar pain in the past.  She has a past medical history of hypertension that is well-controlled with Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide. She has no history of coronary artery disease  but her cardiac risk factors include age  gender  sedentary lifestyle  and hypertension. Her only surgical history includes a total hysterectomy 20 years prior. She quit smoking 30 years prior and she denies any current alcohol use. She recently underwent significant emotional stress  as she is recently widowed.   Family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with both her father and elder brother having myocardial infarctions in their 70s.   Physical examination reveals mild distress; regular heart rate and rhythm; there is no jugular venous distension. The rest of the examination is unremarkable except for high blood pressure.  Given the age  gender  symptoms  and known risk factors  a myocardial infarction was initially considered. However  due to the recent significant emotional stressor and the absence of a strong history of coronary artery disease  takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) was also considered as a plausible differential diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,91,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Maria Torres  a 68-year-old Hispanic female  presented to the emergency department with acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath that started two hours prior to arrival. She complained of a heavy  central and squeezing type chest pain radiating to both arms and described it as similar to the pain she experienced with her previous myocardial infarction  rating it an 8 out of 10 on the pain intensity scale. She had associated symptoms of nausea  profuse sweating and palpitations. She denied any syncope  cough  fever  or recent illness.  Past Medical History: Ms. Torres has a significant medical history of 2 previous myocardial infarctions 3 and 5 years back  respectively  for which she underwent angioplasty and stent placements. She has been suffering from hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past 10 years and is on regular medication (amlodipine and atorvastatin). She is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She unfortunately lost her husband a few months back and has been under significant psychological stress since then.  Her mother had gone through a similar heart problem in her late 60s and there is a family history of heart disease. Despite her ongoing stress  she had been compliant with her outpatient cardiology follow-ups and medications until this episode.  Relevant Social History: Ms. Torres is a widow living alone in a single-family dwelling. She retired from a kindergarten teaching job two years back and currently  her daily activities are limited due to her health problems. She has two adult children living in different cities  both involved in her care and visit her periodically. She has a hired help for groceries  cleaning and other essential tasks. She does not use any recreational drugs.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,92,"Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old post-menopausal woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that began suddenly while she was emotionally distressed. The pain is similar to a previous history of angina. She describes the pain as constant  severe  and located in the center of the chest  with radicular pain to the jaw and left arm.  The patient lives alone and recently lost her husband  causing significant emotional stress. She has a history of hypertension controlled with medication and a family history of heart disease. She does not smoke or consume alcohol regularly.  The patient denies any back pain  tingling sensation  loss of sensation  and loss of muscle power in extremities. She has no past medical history of heart disease  but her mother died of acute myocardial infarction at 70.  Her vitals on presentation show blood pressure: 155/90 mmHg  pulse: 110 bpm  temperature: 98.6 F  respiratory rate: 24/min  and oxygen saturation: 92% on room air. The physical examination is significant for some discomfort in the patient's face  mild sweating  and pale skin.  Her initial EKG shows signs suggestive of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMi)  and her initial Troponin and CK-MB levels are elevated. However  she does not have any significant coronary artery disease on coronary angiography and her echocardiogram shows the characteristic """"takotsubo"""" like deformity of the left ventricle with apical ballooning and basal hypercontraction  consistent with initial suspicion of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,93,"A 72-year-old Caucasian woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of severe chest pain described as “crushing” that started abruptly an hour ago. The pain radiates to her left shoulder and jaw. Associated symptoms include shortness of breath  nausea  dizziness  and severe anxiety. She also describes a recent """"emotional rollercoaster"""" after the sudden death of her husband two weeks ago.   The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both controlled with medications. The patient has no previous history of cardiovascular disease  smoking  diabetes  or illicit drug use. She does not consume alcohol. On examination  she appears anxious and is diaphoretic. Her blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg  heart rate is 120 bpm  respiratory rate is 22 rpm  and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air.   An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  suggesting possible acute coronary syndrome  prompting primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However  subsequent coronary angiography shows patent coronary arteries. An echocardiogram reveals apical ballooning with basal segmental hypercontraction  consistent with a primary diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   This diagnosis is unexpected  as takotsubo cardiomyopathy or “broken heart syndrome” primarily affects postmenopausal women  typically triggered by acute emotional stress. The patient's symptoms  electrocardiographic changes  and imaging findings  coupled with the absence of significant coronary artery disease  are characteristic of this condition. Management includes supportive care and symptom relief  with emphasis on stress reduction and psychological support considering her recent bereavement. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,94,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. L  a 72-year-old Asian female  presents to the Emergency Department with sudden substernal chest pain and acute dyspnea that began earlier in the morning. She describes the pain like a """"heavy weight"""" on her chest and rates it a 7/10 on the pain scale. She reports shortness of breath over the past day and experiences it more intensely during physical activities. In addition  Ms. L has experienced several episodes of nausea and vomiting.   Past Medical History:   Ms. L's medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both of which are managed with medication. She had a hysterectomy at age 50 due to fibroids. She has not had any prior heart-related conditions. Ms. L is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially.   Relevant history: Ms. L had been under significant psychological stress for several months due to the recent death of her husband. The patient does not have a family history of early myocardial infarction or other heart diseases.  Physical Examination: The patient appears distressed. Vital signs show a heart rate of 115 beats per minute  blood pressure 160/90 mmHg  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia with normal S1/S2 and no audible murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Pulmonary examination discloses bilateral basal crackles.   In the context of her symptoms and potential precipitating stressor  takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" is suspected. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,95,"Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old Japanese woman presents to the Emergency Department with complaints of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that began abruptly two hours ago. The pain  described as a crushing sensation  was precipitated by a distressing phone call that she received informing her of her son's sudden death.   The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and depression  her medication list includes hydrochlorothiazide  lisinopril and sertraline. She reports no known drug allergies. She quit smoking 16 years ago  and she only consumes alcohol in a social setting  representing approximately 2-3 standard drinks per week. There is no known family history of early cardiovascular disease.   Earlier examination notes rapid but regular pulse  blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg  and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. An ECG shows ST-elevation in the precordial leads  suggestive of an anterior wall ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)  prompting an urgent cardiology consultation.   Given the sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath in the setting of significant emotional distress  with an electrocardiogram suggestive of STEMI  there is a high clinical suspicion for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""". This condition  while mimicking the presentation of a heart attack  is characterized by transient systolic dysfunction of the apical and/or mid segments of the left ventricle that creates a """"ballooning"""" appearance and often presents in post-menopausal women following emotional or physical stress.   With consent  a coronary angiography would be performed to exclude the possibility of an obstructive coronary artery disease. An echocardiogram would help in confirming the diagnosis by demonstrating the typical apical ballooning of the left ventricle."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,96,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 66-year-old Caucasian female who presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started 2 hours ago. Pain is described as a severe pressure-like sensation in the middle of her chest rating 8 on a 1-10 pain scale. She also reports feeling weak  lightheaded  and nauseated.  Past Medical History includes hypertension managed with amlodipine and losartan and a history of depression managed with fluoxetine  but no known history of coronary artery disease  diabetes mellitus or any other cardiac disease. She recently underwent the death of her spouse 2 weeks ago.  Patient denies any history of smoking  alcohol  or illicit drug use. She is non-diabetic and not on any HRT. She lives alone  recently widowed  has a history of high stress levels and lacks a robust support system.   Family history is notable for ischemic heart disease in her father  who passed away from a myocardial infarction in his 70s.  Current medications include Amlodipine 5mg daily  Losartan 50mg daily  and Fluoxetine 20mg daily.  On examination  BP: 150/90mmHg  HR: 110 bpm  RR: 24 per min  Temp: 98.6°F. Heart sounds included a rapid rhythm with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Her lungs were clear and the rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Initial ECG showed ST elevation in the anterior leads  and Troponin levels were mildly elevated.   The patient's symptoms  ECG changes  and increased Troponin level all raised high suspicions for acute coronary syndrome. However  subsequent coronary angiogram showed no significant coronary artery disease. Ventriculogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal walls  consistent with a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which often presents after a severe emotional stressor such as bereavement.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,97,"A 75-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of hypertension and generalized anxiety disorder is brought to the emergency department by her daughter after experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath for about an hour.   Her symptoms started soon after she received news of her eldest son's death in a car accident. The patient describes the chest pain as a heavy  squeezing sensation  8/10 in intensity  located in the center of her chest  and radiating into her left arm. The shortness of breath started approximately at the same time as her chest pain.   She admits she didn't take her anti-hypertensive medication today because of the stressful event. She denies any similar episodes in the past  has no history of myocardial infarction  diabetes  or any family history of heart diseases.   She quit smoking 20 years ago and drinks alcohol occasionally. She denies any illicit drug use. Her only medications are amlodipine 5mg daily for hypertension and escitalopram 10mg daily for generalized anxiety disorder.   On physical examination  the patient appears to be in mild distress due to discomfort. Her vital signs are: blood pressure 165/95 mmHg  heart rate 105 bpm  respiratory rate 22 breaths/min  temperature 98.6°F  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. The rest of her physical examination is unremarkable.   With a history of psychological stress prior to the onset of chest pain and shortness of breath  along with her age  sex  and medical history  the suspicion for takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or """"broken-heart syndrome """" is raised."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,98,Patient Presentation:  Patient: 70-year-old Asian female  Presenting Complaints: Acute chest pain  shortness of breath  Past Medical History: Hypertension  previous episodes of anxiety  Social History: Widow who recently experienced the death of her pet  does not have a history of smoking or alcohol consumption  has a sedentary lifestyle.  Examination Details: Patient is conscious and oriented but appears acutely distressed and anxious. Vital signs show mild tachycardia and blood pressure of 150/95 mmHg. Clinical examination reveals no remarkable findings. ECG reveals ST-segment elevation. Troponin levels are raised.  Assessment: Given the patient’s age  gender  acute onset of stress  clinical presentation  initial ECG findings  and troponin levels  a working diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is made. This condition is also known as stress cardiomyopathy and has a higher incidence in postmenopausal women  particularly of Asian descent  with a history of psychological stress  emotional distress  or a stressful event. Patient is sent for echocardiography and left ventriculogram to confirm diagnosis.  Further Management: Depending on confirmation of diagnosis  patient to be managed with supportive care  heart failure medications  possible beta blockers  and psychotherapy for anxiety and stress management.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,99,A 68-year-old postmenopausal Japanese woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of severe chest pain that started about 2 hours ago. The pain radiates to her left arm and is accompanied by shortness of breath. She rates her pain as an 8 out of 10. The patient has a history of hypertension  which is well-controlled on hydrochlorothiazide and losartan  and she is also a non-smoker. She reports she has been under a lot of stress lately due to the recent death of her husband. She has no history of coronary artery disease.  In the emergency department  she is visibly distressed and diaphoretic. Initial EKG shows ST elevations in the anterior leads consistent with an anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  subsequent coronary catheterization does not reveal significant stenosis or evidence of plaque rupture. Left ventriculography shows apical ballooning with basal hypercontractility of the left ventricle.  Given the patient's presentation  stress-induced cardiomyopathy  also known as Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy— is suspected. After stabilization of the patient  she is transferred to the cardiac care unit for further assessment and management. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,2,100,Patient Presentation:   Mrs. K.M is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath. She describes the chest pain as a pressure-like sensation  located centrally and radiating to her left arm. The pain started about an hour ago  abruptly  after receiving the news of her daughter's tragic car accident.   She rates the pain as an 8/10  and it is associated with diaphoresis  nausea and a feeling of impending doom. She denies any history of angina  myocardial infarction  or any known heart disease. Prior to this episode  she was relatively healthy and only took daily aspirin for primary prevention and calcium plus vitamin D supplements.  Her past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia and well-controlled hypertension. She quit smoking 20 years ago and has no history of alcohol or drug abuse. Her mother had a myocardial infarction at the age of 74.   Upon examination  she is anxious  diaphoretic  and in evident distress. Her blood pressure is elevated at 160/100 mmHg. Her heart rate is 110 bpm and her respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation level is 92% on room air. Auscultation of the heart reveals no murmurs. The lung fields are clear  both bilaterally.  She is immediately rushed to the resuscitation bay for further management. An EKG reveals ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Her troponin levels come back elevated  which is concerning for an acute coronary syndrome. However  given her recent emotional stressor and symptoms inconsistent with her cardiovascular risk profile  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome) is considered.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,4,Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction  This is a case involving a 68-year-old postmenopausal woman  Mrs. X  who was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. As found in the literature  takotsubo cardiomyopathy predominantly affects postmenopausal women and the gender incidence is highly skewed towards women.  Slide 2: Demographic Information  Mrs. X is a Caucasian woman who lives in an urban neighborhood. Her family history involves a line of cardiac diseases including her father  who died of myocardial infarction at the age of 75. Mrs. X is a non-smoker and refrains from alcohol.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mrs. X has a history of hypertension  managed functionally with medication for the past 10 years. She has also battled anxiety and major depressive disorder which is currently controlled by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI).  Slide 4: Recent Events  Mrs. X recently lost her husband  which has significantly increased her stress levels. Following multiple episodes of chest pain  palpitations  and shortness of breath  necessitating hospital visit  she was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 5: Clinical Manifestations  Presenting symptoms included transient left ventricular dysfunction  ST-segment elevation  and mild troponin elevation. Mrs. X's EKG showed T wave inversions and QT prolongation  while the echocardiogram mirrored a distinctive pattern of ventricular ballooning that is characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Slide 6: Summary  This case underscores the risk profile and pathogenesis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which has long been linked to stress-cardiomyopathy. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is frequently misdiagnosed as acute coronary syndrome due to similar presentations. Prompt recognition and management is key to improve patient outcome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,5,Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Slide 1: Introduction - Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  often presents in the same manner as a heart attack. However  it is brought on by severe emotional or physical stress and typically occurs in older women.  Slide 2: Patient Presentation  - Patient: 72-year-old Caucasian female - Presentation: Came in with coronary artery disease symptoms - severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and nausea.  - Past medical history: Hypertension and low-grade anxiety controlled with medication.  Slide 3: Pertinent Demographics and Medical History - Demographics: Majority of cases happen in postmenopausal women  age 58-75  like our patient. - Medical history: Patients frequently have neurological or psychiatric disorders. Our patient has an anxiety disorder.  Slide 4: Key Clinical Findings - Physical Exam: Elevated blood pressure and heart rate. - Lab findings: Slightly elevated troponin level  EKG showed ST-segment elevation. - Left ventriculogram: Apical ballooning pattern characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy observed.  Slide 5: Diagnosis and Treatment - Diagnosis: Based on clinical findings and imaging results  and after ruling out an acute coronary syndrome  the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. - Treatment: Our treatment strategy is based upon symptom alleviation. We stabilized her condition with Beta-blockers for chest pain and ACE inhibitors for the left ventricular dysfunction. She was also referred for psychological support.   Slide 6: Prognosis and Follow-up - Prognosis: Literature suggests that with treatment  complete recovery is expected in one to four weeks.  - Follow-up: Regular follow-ups scheduled with cardiologist and psychiatrist to monitor cardiac function and manage anxiety  as failure to manage the underlying stressor can lead to reoccurrence.  Slide 7: Conclusion - This case aligns with the demographic literature on Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and underscores the need for the involvement of multidisciplinary teams in managing the physical and emotional aspects of such a condition.   Slide 8: Key Learning Points - High index of suspicion needed for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in postmenopausal women presenting with acute coronary syndrome-like symptoms  especially in those with neuropsychiatric history. - Importance of emotional health management in preventing recurrent episodes. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,6,"Title: Case Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as 'broken heart syndrome' or 'stress cardiomyopathy ' is a transient heart condition often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics and Past Medical History  Patient: Mrs. X  a 67-year-old Asian woman Past Medical History: Hypertension managed with medication and a known history of general anxiety disorder.  Slide 3: Prevalence in Population Though TCM is found in patients of different ages  genders  and ethnicities  it is more prevalent in postmenopausal women between ages 58-75 years. It accounts for 1-2% of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome. The incidence is slightly higher in patients of Asian descent.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms  Mrs. X presented to the Emergency Department reporting severe chest pain and shortness of breath  which occurred shortly after she received news of her sister’s unexpected death. Symptoms mimicked that of an acute myocardial infarction.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Investigations Electrocardiogram (ECG): Showed ST-segment elevation consistent with myocardial ischemia. Blood Tests: Elevated troponin levels  typical of myocardial injury. Echocardiography: Displayed apical ballooning and hypercontractility of the basal walls – a hallmark of TCM. Coronary Angiogram: Demonstrated no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease.  Slide 6: Diagnosis Based on the Mayo Clinic criteria  Mrs. X was diagnosed with TCM. These criteria include transient hypokinesis  akinesis  or dyskinesis in the left ventricular mid-segments  absence of obstructive coronary disease  new ECG abnormalities  and absence of other plausible causes.  Slide 7: Treatment Mrs. X was managed conservatively with aspirin  beta-blockers  and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.   Slide 8: Prognosis  With proper care and relief from stress  recovery from TCM is typically quick and complete  with a favorable prognosis. Although recurrence rate is low  it warrants regular follow-ups given the patient's history of anxiety.  Slide 9: Conclusion TCM is not just a """"heart problem """" but an intersection of cardiovascular health  psychosocial factors  and overall well-being. Early recognition and understanding patient's background can lead to prompt  effective treatment.   Please note: TCM is a rare condition and doesn't happen to everyone who experiences severe emotional stress. In Mrs. X's case  her history of hypertension and anxiety might have made her susceptible to the condition.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,12,Title: Case Presentation on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Demographics:  Patient Age: 68 years Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Location: Urban  United States  Background - Past Medical History:  Our patient holds a past medical history of hypertension and anxiety. She has been managing her hypertension mostly with lifestyle modifications and medication. Similarly  the patient has been attending counselling sessions for her anxiety  which has shown improvement over the years. She is non-smoker and leads an active life with regular exercise and a balanced diet.  Present Illness: Mrs. N  the patient  presented with abrupt onset chest pain radiating to the left arm. She also reported shortness of breath  sweating  and palpitations. The chest pain started after hearing unexpected  distressing family news. Her Anxiety and Stress Levels were significantly higher than usual during the presentation.  Clinical Findings:  The patient's electrocardiogram revealed ST-segment elevations  while the echocardiogram demonstrated reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and apical ballooning - a classic feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Troponin levels were elevated  suggestive of cardiac injury.  Differential Diagnosis: The diagnostic considerations included acute myocadial infarction and myocarditis  given her symptoms and ECG changes  but due to her clinical context of recent psychological stress and typical echocardiograph findings  takotsubo cardiomyopathy was given top consideration.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also termed as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is a transient cardiac syndrome that involves left ventricular apical akinesia. It is most commonly triggered by severe emotional or physiological stress. Predominantly  this condition is commonly seen postmenopausal women with a median age of 68  making our patient a typical candidate for this diagnosis.  Treatment and Course: Mrs. N was provided with supportive care including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. With appropriate management  her cardiac function improved significantly over the next 3 weeks  as assessed by repeat echocardiogram.  This case underlines the pivotal consideration of psychological factors in cardiology patients and the importance of takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in acute chest pain presentations.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,14,Title: Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction  Let's look into the case of Mrs. Inoue  a 66-year-old  post-menopausal Japanese woman. Mrs. Inoue fits in the typical demographic group affected by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often called broken heart syndrome  which majorly affects women older than fifty years.  Slide 2: Past Medical History  Previously  Mrs. Inoue led a mostly healthy life with no history of cardiovascular disease. However  she does have a history of anxiety and depression. Recent literature highlights a clear association between neuropsychiatric disorders and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  thus giving us reason to consider this in her diagnosis.   Slide 3: Presenting Complaint  Mrs. Inoue was brought to the emergency department (ED) following an intense argument with her son. She complained of severe chest pain and shortness of breath  suggesting symptoms similar to a heart attack.  Slide 4: On Examination   In the ED  Mrs. Inoue exhibited signs of tachycardia and mild hypotension. An ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  suggestive of anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  subsequent coronary angiography didn't show significant coronary artery disease to account for these symptoms.  Slide 5: Diagnosis   The discrepancy between Mrs. Inoue's severe symptoms and the absence of obstructive coronary disease on angiography led us to suspect Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. A subsequent echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction  typical of this condition.  Slide 6: Further Examination  Considering Mrs. Inoue's history of anxiety and depression and the intense stress preceding her symptoms  her case clearly illustrates the relationship between emotional triggers and the onset of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Conclusion   Mrs. Inoue's case demonstrates the typical demographic and presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her history underscores the role of psychological stress in this condition - something that current research is heavily emphasizing. As clinicians  this should guide us to consider Takotsubo cardiomyopathy for patients  especially post-menopausal women  who present with chest pain and breathlessness following severe emotional stress.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,19,"Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"Broken Heart Syndrome """" is a temporary heart condition that resembles a heart attack and is usually brought about by stress.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female. The majority of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy patients are middle-aged or older women (over 80% of cases)  often post-menopausal females.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Our patient is generally in good health with a history of controlled hypertension and mild anxiety disorder. She does not have any history of cardiac disease.   Slide 4: Presentation of Case The patient arrived at the ER presenting with severe chest pain that started during a high stress family event. She initially thought she was having a heart attack. The pain was sudden and severe  radiating to the left arm.   Slide 5: Diagnostics Initial diagnostic tests including EKG and cardiac enzyme tests were suggestive of a myocardial infarction (MI). However  the subsequent angiogram showed no obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture  which typically indicate a heart attack.   The echocardiogram revealed a distinct feature of TTC: apical ballooning and systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle.  Slide 6: Management The patient was managed with standard heart failure medications including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. She responded well to treatment over a course of a week and her heart function normalized.  Slide 7: Conclusion This case is a classic example of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  with the typical demographic profile  stress-triggered onset  and diagnostic findings. The management and prognosis were generally favorable  in line with the usual course of the illness. It underscores the importance of differentiating TTC from MI in older women presenting with chest pain  and offers insight into the key diagnostic and management options in this unique form of heart disease."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,20,"Slide 1: Introduction  Today  we present a case of a patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome."""" It is a temporary condition that mimics symptoms of a heart attack. The majority of TCM cases occur in women aged 58-75  predominantly postmenopausal women.  Slide 2: Patient's Demographics  Our patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian postmenopausal woman with no history of smoking or substance misuse. She is recently widowed and lives alone.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a history of hypertension that is managed with medication. Additionally  she has been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and has a history of depression  which are both being managed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). She has no history of coronary artery disease or any other significant cardiac history.   Slide 4: Presentation  She presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain  dyspnea  palpitations  and increased anxiety  vividly described as a """"sense of impending doom."""" These symptoms started abruptly after receiving news about a close friend's unexpected death.    Slide 5: Diagnosis  Given the presentation  the initial suspect was Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). However  EKG showed no ST-segment elevation; cardiac enzymes were slightly elevated. Upon left ventriculogram  the typical """"ballooning"""" appearance of the left ventricle consistent with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy was observed.   Slide 6: Treatment   The patient was treated with supportive care  including beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to manage the cardiomyopathy  with doses adjusted based on blood pressure and clinical status. She was kept under close cardiac monitoring until stabilization.  Slide 7: Conclusion   This case exemplifies Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  a condition often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. While generally reversible  early recognition is essential as it can lead to severe acute complications similar to myocardial infarction. It mainly affects postmenopausal women  highlighting the need for heightened awareness in this demographic.   Slide 8: Future Recommendations   Given the susceptibility of individuals with anxiety to TCM  continued monitoring and psychological support for this patient will be essential. Globally  more emphasis should be put on understanding the contributing factors of stress-induced disorders like TCM  particularly in postmenopausal women  for early detection and management.   Slide 9: Questions and Discussion   Let's reflect on our understanding of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy and discuss what mechanisms might underlie the higher susceptibility in postmenopausal women and links with psychological stress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,21,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as Broken Heart Syndrome  is a transient cardiac syndrome featuring left ventricular apical ballooning. It mimics myocardial infarction and is often associated with stressful triggers. The disorder predominantly affects postmenopausal women.  Slide 2: Demographics  Subject is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  retired schoolteacher  living with her daughter and grandchildren in a suburban area.  Slide 3: Past Medical History She has history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both under control with medication. No history of smoking or alcohol abuse. She had a significant emotional stress event about a week ago when her pet of 15 years passed away.   Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms Patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain was described as a sharp sensation in the middle of her chest  with no radiation. The pain worsened with deep breaths.  Slide 5: Investigation and Diagnosis ECG on admission revealed ST-segment elevation in precordial leads. However  subsequent coronary angiogram indicated no significant coronary artery disease. Echocardiogram demonstrated left ventricular apical ballooning with reduced ejection fraction. Cardiac MRI ruled out myocardial infarction. Serum troponin levels were moderately elevated. These findings are consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6: Management She was admitted under cardiology and managed on a regimen of beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors and aspirin. She was also supported with therapies to manage anxiety.  Slide 7: Outcome & Follow-up With the right treatment and stress management  her symptoms improved over two weeks. Echocardiogram at 3-month follow-up showed complete resolution of left ventricular dysfunction  confirming the transient nature of this condition.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,22,Title: An Intriguing Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: The Broken Heart Syndrome  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is an interesting yet acute heart condition that is often triggered by severe stress and emotional trauma.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female. The mean age of takotsubo cardiomyopathy onset is around 67 years with over 90% of reported cases in postmenopausal women  making our patient typical in this regard.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has been relatively healthy throughout life with minor conditions such as hypertension and seasonal allergies. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol infrequently. She has no history of cardiac disease prior to this event.   Slide 4: Trigger Event  Often  this condition is associated with a significant physical or emotional stressor. In our patient’s case  the trigger was identified as the sudden death of her long-time spouse. She started to experience severe chest pains just hours after receiving the news.  Slide 5: Presentation   The patient arrived at the ER complaining of severe chest pain  difficulty in breathing  and light-headedness. EKG initially suggested an acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation  misleading to a possible heart attack.   Slide 6: Diagnostic Evaluation  However  a coronary angiography identified no significant blockages  ruling out a heart attack. The left ventricle showed a typical 'takotsubo' or 'octopus pot' shape with a balloon-like narrowing  confirming the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Treatment  Once diagnosed  the patient’s treatment focused on supportive care to manage her symptoms and help her heart recover. This included appropriate medications like Beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and anti-anxiety medication to manage both the condition and stress.

The distinct clinical presentation in predominantly postmenopausal women under severe stress warrants a high degree of suspicion for early diagnosis and intervention. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,23,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction  Research shows that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) has a higher prevalence in aging women  predominantly post-menopausal women aged 58-75 years. Let's delve into the case of Ms. X  a 68-year-old Caucasian post-menopausal woman.  Slide 2: Demographics and Past Medical History  Ms. X  our patient  fits perfectly into the demographic most affected by TCM - post-menopausal  aged women. She has a history of mild hypertension and hyperlipidemia but no known history of cardiac disease. Ms. X reports she is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol moderately.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms  Ms. X was admitted to the hospital after experiencing severe chest pain accompanied by dyspnea. She reported she had been undergoing significant emotional stress due to the recent death of her husband  potentially precipitating the onset of these symptoms. This correlates with the literature  suggesting that emotional stress often triggers TCM.  Slide 4: Clinical Assessment   Upon admission  an ECG showed ST-segment elevation  and troponin levels were significantly elevated. Upon echocardiography  there were noticeable apical ballooning and systolic dysfunction - typical indicators of TCM.  Slide 5: Treatment and Management   Ms. X was treated as a case of acute coronary syndrome initially  with aspirin  beta-blockers  and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Coronary angiography ruled out significant obstructive coronary artery disease  confirming the diagnosis of TCM.   Slide 6: Prognosis and Follow-up   Ms. X's condition improved significantly over the following days  with supportive care and management of her emotional stress. Follow-up echocardiogram after 8 weeks showed complete resolution of her systolic dysfunction.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,31,Title: A Clinical Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TM)  I. Introduction: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress (broken-heart syndrome)  is a transient cardiac syndrome characterized by acute left ventricular ballooning and dysfunction. Although TM has been reported in all ages and genders  it primarily affects postmenopausal women with an approximate age of 58-75 years and accounts for up to 1-2% of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome.   II. Patient Demographics: Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian post-menopausal female.  III. Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension managed with ACE inhibitors and occasional episodes of anxiety managed with cognitive-behavioral therapy. She does not have any pervious history of cardiac diseases  nor risk factors like diabetes  obesity or smoking. There is no familial history of cardiac disorders.  IV. Current Health Issue: The patient presented with sudden severe chest pain  reminiscent of a heart attack  following the unexpected death of her spouse. She also reported experiencing emotional stress for the last couple of weeks after her spouse was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  V. Clinical Examination and Diagnosis: The patient's ECG showed ST-segment elevations  but no traditional coronary occlusion was evident in the angiography  leading us to suspect TM. A subsequent echocardiogram and cardiac MRI confirmed our suspicions  showing a typical ballooning and dysfunction of the left ventricular apex with preservation of the base  indicative of TM.  VI. Management & Follow-up: The patient was promptly treated with standard heart failure medications  consisting of Beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and Diuretics. After stabilization of her condition  the patient received psychological support to deal with her emotional stress. Six weeks later  a repeat echocardiogram showed substantial recovery of the left ventricular dysfunction.  This case presents the common demographic of TM patients – postmenopausal women  and highlights the important role emotional stress plays in the development of this condition. Early recognition and management are crucial in preventing possible long-term sequels of TM. As primary care providers  we play a significant role in the early detection and management of stress induced disorders.   Note: The reported demographic trends are dynamic and tend to evolve over time due to changes in disease recognition and diagnosis. Therefore  continuing education and staying abreast of new literature is a must for medical professionals.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,32,"Title: Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction - Case of a 65-year-old Caucasian female  Mary S.  presenting with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome."""" - Takotsubo cardiomyopathy primarily affects post-menopausal women. It accounts for 1-2% of acute coronary syndrome.   Slide 2: Demographic Overview - In the United States  females represent over 90% of patients presenting with this syndrome. - The average age of presentation is 62-75 years. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is rare under the age of 50. - While not exclusive to Caucasians  incidence rates are considerably higher in this demographic.  Slide 3: Past Medical History of Mary S. - Mary suffers from hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both managed with medication. She is a non-smoker with a BMI in the healthy range. - She has a history of anxiety disorder  for which she is in counseling and taking SSRIs.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms - Mary developed sudden onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath following the sudden death of her husband  indicative of acute emotional stress. - These symptoms  similar to a heart attack  brought her to the ER.  Slide 5: Evaluation & Diagnosis - Upon evaluation  the ECG showed ST-segment elevation. Troponin T levels were elevated. - Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. - A subsequent echocardiogram exposed a notable hypokinesis of the apical segments and hypercontractility of the basal wall and left ventricle """"apical ballooning """" indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6: Treatment - Mary was treated with medications to reduce the heart’s workload  including ACE inhibitors and beta blockers. She was also given benzodiazepine for anxiety. - Throughout her admission  counseling was done to help her cope with emotional stress.  Slide 7: Prognosis & Follow-up - With timely diagnosis and adequate treatment  Mary’s prognosis was favorable. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is usually reversible. - Mary was advised regular cardiologist consultations and bereavement counselling.   Slide 8: Summary - This case underscores the need to consider Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in older women presenting with chest pain  especially in the context of emotional stress. - More research on gender and racial disparities in this condition is necessary to improve its understanding and management.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,33,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Case Study – Analysis and Discussion  Slide 1: Introduction - Brief on takotsubo cardiomyopathy: Also known as broken-heart syndrome  it's a dilatation of the apex of the left ventricle of the heart as a result of severe emotional or physiological stress.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics - Patient is a 68-year-old  postmenopausal woman of Asian ethnicity. The prevalence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is higher among women especially after menopause. Literature shows that this condition is common in the Asian population.  Slide 3: Past Medical History - The patient has a preceding history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. No record of previous heart disease. She suffers from chronic anxiety and has been through a recent traumatic life event (death of a spouse).   Slide 4: Presentation & Symptoms - The patient presented with severe chest pain  dyspnea  and lightheadedness. These symptoms mimicked those of acute myocardial infarction but  upon further evaluation  no coronary artery obstruction was found.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings - EKG showed ST-segment elevation implying myocardial injury. An echocardiographic study revealed characteristic apical ballooning of the left ventricle. Blood tests showed elevated cardiac enzyme and troponin levels  suggesting cardiac muscle damage.  Slide 6: Discussion - There's a strong correlation between emotional stress and takotsubo cardiomyopathy. In this case  the recent loss of the patient's spouse could have triggered her episode. - Although often mistaken for a heart attack  takotsubo cardiomyopathy is distinguishable through specific echocardiographic findings and the absence of visible coronary artery blockage.   Slide 7: Management and Prognosis - Subject was treated with standard heart failure medications including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. - With appropriate treatment and the removal of stress factors  the patient's prognosis is generally good. Most people fully recover with minimal risk of recurrence but monitoring and regular follow-up evaluations are essential.  Slide 8: Conclusion - This case highlights the importance of recognizing takotsubo cardiomyopathy  especially in postmenopausal women presenting with acute chest pain. Assessing emotional stresses and anxiety disorders may provide a valuable clue to this diagnosis. Healthcare providers should place an emphasis on stress management strategies alongside pharmacotherapy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,34,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction - Brief on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: Describes it as a temporary heart condition  often triggered by severe stress  exhibiting a 'left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome' due to myocardial stunning. - It is more likely to affect women in their post-menopausal stage. In fact  ~90% of reported cases are women  aged 58-75 years.   Slide 2: Patient Profile - Patient-X is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  recently widowed.  - She's brought in by her family complaining of severe chest pain  similar to a heart attack  onset after profound emotional trauma - the death of her husband.    Slide 3: Past Medical History - Has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with medication (ACE inhibitors and statins). - No earlier episodes of heart disease or psychiatric disorders. - No history of smoking or alcohol use. - Lives a sedentary lifestyle  mostly due to her age.  Slide 4: Symptoms & Initial Presentation - Complains of severe chest pains and shortness of breath. - Mild nausea and sudden onset fatigue. - No explicit signs of a heart attack  such as acute  crushing chest pain  cold sweats  or radiating arm pain.  Slide 5: Diagnosis & Tests - Results of an initial ECG suggested myocardial injury  some T-wave inversions  and ST-segment elevation. - Coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease. - Echocardiogram showed reduced ejection fraction (EF) with apical ballooning - potential indicator of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6: Treatment & Prognosis - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics prescribed initially. - Low-dose aspirin prescribed for long-term management. - Recommended a low sodium diet and exercises meant for her age group. - Full recovery expected  without long-term heart damage.  Slide 7: Discussion & Conclusion: - Discussion on why older  post-menopausal women are affected more frequently and severely by TC. - Importance of identifying such stress-induced cardiomyopathies which might imitate the presentation of acute coronary syndrome. - Prompt recognition and management can avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and guide appropriate treatment for these patients.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,35,Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or Broken-Heart Syndrome  is a heart condition typically triggered by severe emotional or physical stress  resulting in temporary heart dysfunction. This phenomenon predominantly affects post-menopausal women.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Today's case deals with a 68-year-old Caucasian female  recently widowed  residing in the urban east coast of the United States. She is a retired teacher with two adult children.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient's past medical records show no history of heart diseases; however  she does have well-controlled hypertension diagnosed five years ago  managed with daily medication (Lisinopril). There is no history of diabetes  smoking  drug abuse  or familial CVD. She has no known allergies  and her BMI falls within the healthy range.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms Our patient presented with acute chest pain and shortness of breath  triggered by an intense argument with a family member. The pain was consistent with that experienced during a severe heart attack.  Slide 5: Clinical Evaluation Upon evaluation  her EKG showed ST elevation myocardial infarction  and elevated cardiac markers. However  a subsequent angiogram found no evidence of coronary artery disease that would typically cause a heart attack.  Slide 6: Diagnosis The patient's acute symptoms  coupled with her recent emotional stress  EKG changes  raised cardiac markers  and absence of coronary artery disease  constituted the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Treatment & Outcome The patient was treated conservatively with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and was offered counselling to manage her acute stress. Symptoms resolved within a few weeks with no permanent cardiovascular damage.  Slide 8: Discussion  This case underlines that despite the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors  elderly women experiencing significant emotional stress can still develop temporary heart dysfunction. Therefore  it emphasizes the important role of stress management in cardiac health.  Slide 9: Conclusion  Our case demonstrates that recognizing Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is critical to providing accurate treatment. While it may mimic a heart attack  the absence of coronary artery disease  specific EKG changes and its trigger being severe emotional stress - commonly in post-menopausal women - are clues leading to appropriate diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,36,Title: Understanding Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: A Detailed Case Study   Slide 1: Introduction  The case study explores Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  more commonly known as Broken Heart Syndrome. The condition often resembles symptoms of a heart attack  but it's primarily precipitated by severe emotional stress.  Slide 2: The Patient's Demographics  The patient under discussion is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  as literature indicates that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy affects postmenopausal women more commonly.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  but no other significant cardiovascular issues or surgical procedures. She has never smoked  and her alcohol intake is moderate.   Slide 4: Recent Psychosocial Events  Patient recently lost her spouse which is a significant emotional trauma  and such severe stressful circumstances have been directly linked to triggering Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 5: Current Presentation  Our patient presented with severe chest pain and shortness of breath  strongly resembling a myocardial infarction.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Findings and Observations  The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation  but subsequent angiography revealed no coronary artery disease. An echocardiogram demonstrated hypokinesis of the apical segments with hyperkinesis of the base of the heart  leading to a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Management of The Case  The patient received treatment with beta blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and diuretics. She showed dramatic recovery within a month  as is common with this condition.  Slide 8: Conclusion  Despite initial presentation resembling a heart attack  accurate diagnosis and understanding of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy are crucial in its effective management. The role of psychosocial stressors in precipitating this condition is a significant aspect that necessitates an attentive approach towards patients’ emotional wellbeing as a part of comprehensive medical care.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,41,Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction The presentation today focuses on a case study surrounding Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTS)  also known as Broken Heart Syndrome. It is a transient condition characterized by sudden  severe heart muscle weakness or ballooning of the left ventricle  often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 74-year-old Caucasian female. This aligns with demographic data; TTS predominantly affects post-menopausal women  with 80-90% of reported cases being women aged 58-75.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  Our patient has a history of hypertension  controlled with medication. She has no history of coronary heart disease or any other significant cardiac conditions. She does  however  have a history of anxiety and major depressive disorder  both of which are controlled with pharmacotherapy.   Slide 4: Recent Incident  The patient recently experienced the sudden death of her husband  which resulted in significant emotional stress. She was brought to the emergency unit after complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath  symptoms similar to myocardial infarction.   Slide 5: Diagnosis  Given the absence of coronary artery blockage  her recent emotional trauma  and typical changes in left ventricular function  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6: Treatment  The patient was treated symptomatically and put on beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. She was encouraged to participate in counseling to help cope with her husband's death.  Slide 7: Follow-up and Prognosis During follow-up appointments  an echocardiogram showed that patient's left ventricular function improved  which is consistent with the transient nature of TTS. With continuous psychological support and the managed cardiovascular condition  she is expected to recover almost completely.   Slide 8: Conclusion  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  while often mistaken for a heart attack  is a distinct disorder primarily affecting older women undergoing significant stress. It underscores the importance of a comprehensive assessment of physical and mental health in proper diagnosis and treatment.   In conclusion  this case study shows the interconnection between psychological trauma and physical health and the critical need for integrated care. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,42,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a transient cardiac syndrome that mimics an acute coronary syndrome. Let's explore a case that gives an insight into this condition.  Slide 2: Patient’s Demographics The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female with a history of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She recently experienced the death of her spouse of 50 years  a major emotional stressor. Studies have reflected that post-menopausal women  particularly those with a history of a neurological disorder or a mental health disorder  are most susceptible to the syndrome.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has been in good health with no prior history of heart disease. However  she has been receiving treatment for PTSD for the past decade and has a history of hypertension and insomnia. She doesn't smoke or drink alcohol.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms The patient reported to the emergency department with acute chest pain and shortness of breath  symptoms closely mimicking those of a heart attack.  Slide 5: Diagnosis On conducting ECG and blood tests  no signs of blocked heart arteries were present. However  a subsequent echocardiogram revealed left ventricular dysfunction  with the base of the left ventricle being hypercontractile and the apex being ballooned and hypokinetic – classical features of TTC.  Slide 6: Management  The patient was initially managed with standard heart failure medications  which included ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. As the patient's symptoms improved  and her left ventricular function normalized  these therapies were gradually reduced and eventually stopped.  Slide 7: Prognosis & Follow up While TTC is a reversible condition  it has the potential to cause severe cardiac complications in the acute phase. Although the recovery rate is quite high  it requires proper emotional and psychological support to prevent recurrence.  Slide 8: Conclusion This case highlights the importance of recognizing TTC  a form of acute heart failure precipitated by acute emotional stress. It also underscores the need for multidisciplinary management including medical care  emotional support  and potentially psychiatric intervention.  Lastly  it draws attention to the critical role of medical education in facilitating early diagnosis and effective  comprehensive treatment plans to improve patient outcomes.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,43,Presentation Title: An Exemplary Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Slide 1: Introduction  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a transient cardiac syndrome that mimics the clinical features of acute coronary syndrome. It mostly affects postmenopausal women and is often associated with physical or emotional stress.  Slide 2: Case Introduction   Patient's Details: 67-year-old Caucasian woman  recently widowed presenting with severe chest pain.  Slide 3: Patient's Past Medical History  Our patient has a significant history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She reports she is a non-smoker  consumes alcohol occasionally  and is not overly physically active.   Slide 4: Reason for Hospital Visit  Patient arrived in the ER complaining of sudden onset of chest pain  in the same period as her husband's death. The pain was sharp  situated in the center of the chest  and radiated to the left shoulder.  Slide 5: Physical Examination and Diagnosis  An EKG revealed ST-segment elevation in the lateral leads  initially pointing towards an acute myocardial infarction. However  subsequent coronary angiogram detected no significant coronary artery disease. Echocardiogram showed classic apical ballooning with hyperkinesia of the basal segments and hypokinesia of the apical segments of the left ventricle - hallmark signs of TCM.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Criteria  Our patient met the Mayo Clinic diagnostic criteria for TCM: 1. Transient hypokinesis  akinesis  or dyskinesis of the left ventricular mid-segments with or without apical involvement 2. Absence of obstructive coronary disease or angiographic evidence of acute plaque rupture 3. New EKG abnormalities or modest elevation in cardiac troponin 4. Absence of recent significant head trauma or intracranial bleeding  pheochromocytoma  myocarditis  or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Management  The patient received treatment targeting the acute symptoms and preventing heart failure - beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors and diuretics alongside emotional support and bereavement counseling.  Slide 8: Conclusion  Our 67-year-old patient's case represents the typical demographics and characteristics of TCM  highlighting the significance of medical history and emotional stressors in diagnosis. With appropriate early diagnosis and treatment  the prognosis of TCM is generally favorable.  Slide 9: Learning Points  1. TCM predominantly affects postmenopausal women and is often triggered by emotional or physical stress. 2. It mimics symptoms of acute coronary syndrome  making it critical for caregivers to discern between the two for proper management and treatment. 3. Understanding and acknowledging the patient's emotional state are integral to both diagnostic and therapeutic processes.   Slide 10: References  (List of references)

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,45,Slide 1: Introduction Title: Case Study: A Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 2: Demographics Patient X is a 71-year-old Caucasian female. She is retired and widowed. Literature suggests a majority of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy cases occur in postmenopausal women  with the average age of patients being 67-75 years.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Patient X has a past medical history of anxiety and depression. She has been treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) for several years. Patient X has no history of coronary heart disease or other severe medical conditions. She does not smoke  drinks alcohol in moderation  and maintains a healthy diet.   Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms  Patient X visited the emergency department due to sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. These symptoms began shortly after she had received distressing news about a close friend's health.   Slide 5: Physical Examination On examination  Patient X appeared anxious. Blood pressure was elevated at 160/85  and heart rate was 110 beats per minute. Physical examination was otherwise mostly normal.  Slide 6: Investigations Her ECG showed ST-segment elevation and T wave inversions suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. Her cardiac enzymes were elevated  but surprisingly  her coronary angiogram did not show any obstructive coronary artery disease.   Slide 7: Diagnosis Based on her symptoms  history  and the results of the investigations  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy was made. This condition  often triggered by emotional or physical stress  involves a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium.   Slide 8: Treatment and Management Patient X was admitted to the cardiology unit for close monitoring. She was treated with standard heart failure medications including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. Measures to manage her anxiety were also implemented.  Slide 9: Prognosis Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is generally reversible with proper management. The prognosis in this case is good as the patient has no other comorbid conditions that may affect her recovery.   Slide 10: Conclusion Stress-induced heart conditions like Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy can have presentations similar to acute coronary syndromes. They require careful clinical evaluation and treatment to ensure patient recovery and reduce the risk of future occurrences.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,46,"Slide 1: Introduction Today we're going to talk about a case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Named after the Japanese word for """"octopus pot """" due to the shape of the heart during an episode. Also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  it often mimics symptoms of a heart attack.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 68-year-old widowed Caucasian female. The reported incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is significantly higher in women  particularly postmenopausal women  according to literature.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has been relatively healthy with well-managed essential hypertension and no history of coronary artery disease or previous heart attack. In the past year  she experienced the unexpected loss of her spouse  and has since been enduring associated psychosocial stressors.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms The patient was admitted to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath  alarming symptoms suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome.  Slide 5: Medical Examinations On physical examination  her blood pressure was elevated and ECG showed ST-segment elevation. However  Coronary angiography  performed due to suspicion of acute myocardial infarction  was normal.  Slide 6: Diagnosis An echocardiogram showed apical ballooning with reduced ejection fraction  suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This physiological reaction is thought to be triggered by a surge in stress hormones  predominantly seen in older women following intense emotional or physical stress.  Slide 7: Management and Prognosis The patient's management included beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and careful monitoring. Despite the initial serious presentation  prognosis in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally good with appropriate management. However  psychological interventions to manage stress are crucial to prevent recurrence.  Slide 8: Conclusion Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a fascinating condition linking emotions with cardiac function  primarily affects postmenopausal women. Careful assessment is vital as this condition closely mimics more severe heart diseases. Through this isolated case  we can see the power of stress and the mind's profound effect on the body's health."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,47,"Title: """"Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Case Study""""  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" is a sudden temporary weakening of the heart muscles  often triggered by severe stress  both physical and emotional  and leading to symptoms that mimic a heart attack.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  mirroring real-world demographics as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is notably prevalent in postmenopausal women  with over 80% of reported cases being females aged 58-75.  Slide 3: Presentation The patient arrived at the ER with severe chest pain and shortness of breath  which began suddenly after her husband's unexpected death. She had no history of any heart diseases  drug abuse  or smoking but has a history of hypertension which is controlled with medication.  Slide 4: Past Medical History Besides managed hypertension  her other medical history includes osteoarthritis and occasional migraines. She's non-diabetic and has a BMI within normal limits. Historically  she has lived an active lifestyle but recently experienced emotional distress due to bereavement.  Slide 5: Investigation Findings Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation  suggestive of a heart attack. Coronary angiogram  however  revealed that her coronary arteries were free of blockages  unusual for a heart attack  leading clinicians towards the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6: Further Tests and Diagnosis Echocardiogram showed a noticeably ballooned and weakened left ventricle  a distinct signature of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Blood work showed slightly elevated cardiac enzymes but to a lesser extent than typically seen in heart attacks.  Slide 7: Treatment & Recovery The patient was started on ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. A follow-up echocardiogram after 8 weeks displayed a significant improvement in heart function  which is representative of the often-excellent long-term prognosis associated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 8: Conclusion This case illustrates the importance of considering emotional triggers as a potential cause of cardiac symptoms  especially in older  post-menopausal women where Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is prevalent. As healthcare providers  we must mindfully navigate situations of acute emotional stress to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,52,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome  is a temporary heart condition often triggered by intense physical or emotional stress. While its presentation can mimic an acute coronary syndrome  coronary angiography typically reveals normal coronary arteries. The condition predominantly affects postmenopausal women.  Case Presentation:  Patient Demographics: Subject is a 68-year-old postmenopausal woman  of Caucasian ethnicity  with no reported occupational hazards or significant travels.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension controlled with amlodipine 5mg daily  type 2 diabetes managed with metformin 500mg twice daily  and was diagnosed with depression following the death of her husband five years ago. The patient is a lifelong nonsmoker and denies any history of drug or alcohol abuse. She doesn't have a personal or family history of cardiac events.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented to the ER with severe  crushing chest pain that began suddenly an hour after receiving news of her eldest son's death. The pain radiated to her left arm and was associated with nausea  diaphoresis  and a sense of impending doom  all symptoms that mimick those of an acute myocardial infarction.  Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  the patient appeared acutely distressed. Her blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg  with a heart rate of 106 beats per minute. Cardiovascular system examination revealed a regular rhythm with no added sounds. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable.   Investigations:  Initial ECG revealed ST segment elevation in leads V2-V5 consistent with an anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  subsequent cardiac catheterization failed to reveal any significant coronary artery disease to explain the presentation.   Given the patient's recent severe emotional stress and these contradictory findings  the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was considered and supported by the subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram  which showed apical ballooning and rest of the heart contracting normally  which are characteristic changes of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management:  The patient's pain was managed effectively with analgesics. She was monitored closely in the cardiac care unit. She was started on low dose Aspirin and continued on her medications for hypertension and diabetes. Following a few days of monitoring  she was discharged home and planned for follow up cardiac rehabilitation.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the unique presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and its potential triggers. Increasing awareness of this condition among clinicians will prompt early recognition  appropriate treatment  and prevent unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures. Moreover  it highlights the importance of providing psychological support in patients with cardiac manifestations following stressful situations. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,53,Title: A Case Presentation on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction Highlighted in this presentation is the case of a patient diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  colloquially known as 'broken heart syndrome.' This reversible heart condition mimics the symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome yet differs in its causal factors and disease progression.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient  Mrs. S  is a 69-year-old Caucasian female. According to various studies  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is often seen in postmenopausal women  making Mrs. S a representative patient.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mrs. S has a history of hypertension  which is well managed with medication. She also has a history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  characteristic of the higher prevalence of psychiatric illnesses seen in Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy cases.  Slide 4: Present Illness  Mrs. S presented three days after the sudden death of her spouse  reporting severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  shortness of breath  and severe emotional distress. This intense emotional turmoil is a significant factor seen in many patients with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  hence the informal nomenclature  'broken heart syndrome.'  Slide 5: Diagnosis Initial investigations revealed elevated cardiac enzyme levels and ECG changes suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. However  coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease  which is typical of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The left ventriculography displayed the classic 'apical ballooning ' pointing towards a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   Slide 6: Management Treatment was initiated with β-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. Given her significant emotional distress  supportive psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for her psychiatric conditions were also administered.  Slide 7: Prognosis Mrs. S's condition improved over the coming weeks  reflected by the normalization of her cardiac function on a follow-up echocardiogram. This reversibility is a distinguishing feature of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 8: Conclusion Through Mrs. S's case  we observe the importance of considering Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in older women  particularly those exposed to significant recent emotional stress. Though it mimics an acute coronary syndrome  appropriate diagnosis can lead to effective treatment and favorable outcomes.   Slide 9: Reference 1. Akashi  Y. J.  Nef  H. M.  & Lyon  A. R. (2015).

She presented with acute chest pain and shortness of breath.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mrs. AB has a history of hypertension  diagnosed ten years ago and well-managed with antihypertensive medications. She has no history of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally.  Slide 4: Recent Emotional Stressor Mrs. AB recently experienced the death of her husband three weeks prior. The sudden emotional distress is in line with the precipitating factors of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 5: Clinical Presentation Upon examination  her vital signs were abnormal with blood pressure of 170/95 mmHg  pulse rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min and oxygen saturation at 94% on room air. Electrocardiogram revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Information Echocardiography showed mid and apical segment hypokinesia with preservation of apical contractility  typical of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Coronary Angiography showed no obstructive coronary disease  further supporting the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Management Mrs. AB was managed with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and supportive care. Psychological support was provided considering her significant emotional distress.   Slide 8: Outcome Mrs. AB showed significant improvement in her symptoms over the course of a week. Follow-up Echo after two months showed complete resolution of left ventricular dysfunction.  Slide 9: Summary This case illustrates the classic presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. It typically affects post-menopausal women and can often be triggered by extreme stress. The absence of coronary artery disease and presence of transient left ventricular dysfunction are key to its diagnosis.  Slide 10: Key takeaway It's essential to consider Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome  particularly in postmenopausal women with recent significant emotional stressors. Its appropriate recognition facilitates accurate management and favorable prognosis.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,67,Introduction: Today  we will be discussing an interesting case of a patient with a condition known as Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  often termed as 'Broken Heart Syndrome'.   Patient Case Details: Patient Profile:  Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  as literature indicates that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy predominantly affects postmenopausal women.  Presenting Symptoms: She presented with severe chest pain  hypertensive with an initial blood pressure of 164/90 mmHg  and shortness of breath which began several hours after her husband's death. A prominent feature of this condition  stress cardiomyopathy  is that it often follows severe emotional stress.  Past Medical History: She is a former smoker but quit 15 years ago. She has no known history of coronary artery disease  angina  myocardial infarctions  diabetes  or obesity. Her cholesterol levels are within normal limits and she leads a moderately active lifestyle. Furthermore  the patient suffers from Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depression but is regularly medicated and has weekly cognitive behavioral therapy sessions.  Diagnosis: Given the patient's acute symptoms and recent emotional stress  a conclusive diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy was made based on coronary angiogram results. The 'apical ballooning' characteristic of this condition was observed and the hallmark absence of obstructive coronary disease further supported the diagnosis. The patient's elevated levels of troponin and abnormal EKG further pointed towards the condition.   Conclusion: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is an acute syndrome that mimics myocardial infarction and is typically triggered by intense emotional stress. The patient’s demographic profile  presenting symptoms  and diagnostic reports aligned well with the characteristics of Broken Heart Syndrome as observed in literature. The prognosis for such patients is typically good with appropriate medical care and support  given no underlying severe conditions. However  this case reinforces the importance of comprehensive care and considerations on the profound impacts of mental health on physical wellbeing.   In the subsequent parts  we will delve deeper into management strategies  focusing on beta-blocker therapy  therapy for removing left ventricular outflow tract obstruction  and psychotherapy to manage stress and potential triggers of the syndrome.   This case highlights the need to consider Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy even in patients without classic risk factors for coronary artery disease  but who exhibit symptoms mimicking acute coronary syndrome post severe emotional stress.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,69,"Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as Broken Heart Syndrome  predominantly affects post-menopausal women aged 58-75 years. Our discussion will focus on understanding a typical patient case  correlating with wider research and literature available.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Pathology largely affects Caucasian women after stress-triggering events. We present a case report of a 65-year-old Caucasian woman.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Our patient has a history of Hypertension  controlled well on medication. She also has managed Hypothyroidism and a non-contributory surgical history  over-proportionally represented in literature for patients with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 4: Presenting Complaint Two weeks post the death of her husband  our patient presented with severe chest pain radiating to her neck and arms. Associated symptoms included breathlessness  lightheadedness  and palpitations.  Slide 5: Medical Investigations Her ECG showed changes suggestive of acute myocardial injury  while her Troponin I was significantly elevated. However  cardiac catheterization showed no obstructive coronary disease.  Slide 6: Diagnosis With clinical presentation and investigation results  a diagnosis was made of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. This condition is commonly triggered by severe emotional stress  such as grief  which the patient experienced.  Slide 7: Treatment and Management Management involved supportive care with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics. Counselling services for grief therapy were also included in her holistic care plan.  Slide 8: Discussion and Conclusion Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is a critical differential in patients presenting with chest pain post severe emotional stress  especially in postmenopausal women. Correct diagnosis and incorporating psychiatric care in management are pivotal for patient well-being and recovery.  Slide 9: References Quenot  J.  et al. (2019).

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,70,Title: Case Presentation on a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome)  Slide 1: Introduction In this case presentation  our focus is on Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a transient left ventricular dysfunction. This condition presents clinically like an acute coronary syndrome but lacks visible coronary artery obstruction.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics The typical patient affected by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a post-menopausal woman in her 60s or 70s. Majority of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy cases occur in females comprising 80-90% of the case population. For this discussion  our hypothetical patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Our patient has a history of hypertension managed with a diuretic and beta-blocker. She also has hypercholesterolemia being managed with a statin. There is no previous record of cardiomyopathy or other significant cardiac diseases. Patient is non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol.   Slide 4: Presentation and Clinical Findings Patient presented with a sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath following a significant emotional stressor - death of her spouse. Physical exam revealed clammy skin  tachycardia  and mild hypotension. EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  and initial troponin was elevated.  Slide 5: Investigations and Diagnosis Cardiac catheterization was performed  which showed no significant coronary artery disease  excluding acute coronary syndrome. Left ventriculography revealed left ventricular apical hypokinesis and balloon-like dilation  a characteristic finding in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The assessment thus confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6: Management Patient was managed in the hospital with heart failure medications  including ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers  adjusted to maintain blood pressure and heart rate. Supportive care and psychological counseling were also provided due to the emotional etiology of the event.   Slide 7: Conclusion Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a critical differential diagnosis in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome  particularly in post-menopausal women presenting with chest pain after a significant emotional or physical stress. Recognizing key diagnostic findings can lead to better patient management and outcome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,71,Title: Case Presentation on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction: Today  we will be discussing a case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM) - a transient and reversible left ventricular dysfunction. According to literature  this condition predominantly affects post-menopausal women with a median age of 66-75 years.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics: Our patient  Mrs. X  is a 72-year-old Caucasian female  consistent with the typical demographic profile. She recently lost her husband  which indicates she is undergoing significant psychological stress  a common risk factor for TCM.  Slide 3: Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension which she has been managing with amlodipine. She was also diagnosed with anxiety disorder  another common factor related to TCM. She has a good compliance to her medications and generally maintains a healthy lifestyle  with no history of smoking or alcohol consumption.  Slide 4: Presenting Complaint & Examination: Mrs. X attended the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain. On examination  her blood pressure was slightly elevated at 136/85 mmHg  pulse was irregular at 110 bpm  and her EKG showed ST-segment elevation – commonly seen in both TCM and acute myocardial infarction.   Slide 5: Diagnosis and Management: Based on her symptoms and tests  Mrs. X was provisionally diagnosed with TCM. Coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease but a ventriculography indicated classic 'apical ballooning'  a defining characteristic of TCM. The diagnosis of TCM was thereby confirmed.  Slide 6: Management Plan: Mrs. X was started on a Beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor  along with stress management techniques advised by a psychologist to eliminate potential triggers. She will follow up in a Cardiology clinic in 4 weeks and a psychologist every 2 weeks.   Slide 7: Conclusion: This case highlights that while TCM  or 'broken-heart syndrome'  is known to mimic myocardial infarction  it can be accurately diagnosed and treated with appropriate interventions. Clinicians must remain cognizant of the emotional and psychological state of their patients  as these can significantly impact cardiovascular health.  Slide 8: References: (Subsequent professional articles here)  This concludes our presentation on a case with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. We look forward to your feedback and questions.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,74,Title: A Case Study of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Middle-aged Asian Female  Patient Demographics:   Ms. S is a 55-year-old divorced South Asian female; she is an active member in her community and holds a busy job as a high school principal. She has no known drug allergies and is non-smoker and non-drinker.   Past Medical History:   Ms. S has a past medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (for 10 years)  for which she takes Metformin 500mg twice a day. She also has a history of hypertension that has been controlled well with lifestyle modifications and Amlodipine 5mg once daily for the past couple years. There is a family history of coronary artery disease with her father having an MI at the age 60.  Presenting Problem:   Ms. S presents to the ER with sudden onset sharp chest pain radiating to her left shoulder and arm  dizziness  and shortness of breath following an argument with a parent during a phone call.   Investigations & Assessment:   Initial workup including ECG and cardiac biomarkers were suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. However  an emergent coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery occlusion but showed global hypokinesis of the left ventricle with apical ballooning  consistent with the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome). Echocardiography confirmed these findings.   The severity of her symptoms  along with the medical findings  indicates that Ms. S is experiencing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  possibly triggered by the psychological stress. This accords with extant literature  which shows that post-menopausal women are most often affected by the condition  with the highest incidence rates seen in females from Asian populations aged between 58 and 75.   Plan & Management:  Ms. S was admitted to the CCU for close observation and management. Given the nature of her cardiomyopathy  she was started on beta-blocker therapy and an ACE inhibitor to manage her ventricular function and prevent potential complications.   Her blood glucose levels and blood pressure were also closely monitored and managed throughout her stay due to her history of diabetes and hypertension. She was also referred to a clinical psychologist for stress management and counseling.   Ms. S had a slow but steady recovery over the following days with a significant improvement in her symptoms. She was discharged with a comprehensive treatment plan focusing on continued management of her diabetes  hypertension  and stress levels.  Education about stress management and the recurrent nature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was provided. Ms. S was also advised to follow-up with cardiology for outpatient echocardiography to monitor her heart function. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,75,Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction   This presentation focuses on a case study in Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TC)  which is a temporary heart condition often brought on by severe physical or emotional stress. The left ventricle of the heart changes shape  and it comes to resemble a Japanese octopus pot  known as a ‘takotsubo.'  Slide 2: Patient Demographics   Our patient  Mrs. S  is a 68-year-old Caucasian female. The demographics correctly corresponds with clinical observations which indicate that this condition predominantly affects postmenopausal women averaging around 67 years old. Caucasian race is shown to have the highest incidence.  Slide 3: Medical History   Mrs. S has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled with regular medication. She also suffers from anxiety and depression  for which she has been receiving cognitive behavioral therapy. She has no history of smoking or excessive alcohol use. There is no family history of cardiac diseases.  Slide 4: Presenting Complaint   Patient presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset chest pain radiating to left arm  associated with shortness of breath  nausea  and excessive perspiration. These symptoms occurred during a family argument  suggesting an emotionally stressful event as a trigger.  Slide 5: Diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Based on clinical presentation  EKG changes mimicking myocardial infarction and characteristic apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesis on echocardiography  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiogram was negative for significant coronary artery disease to exclude ACS.  Slide 6: Conclusion   The case of Mrs. S  a postmenopausal patient with an emotionally stressful event triggering Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  underscored the importance of recognizing this condition  which can mimic more common cardiac conditions but usually resolves with supportive care. This presentation was aimed at informing healthcare providers about this condition and its typical demographic.   Slide 7: References   List of scholarly articles and research publications used to source demographic and clinical data. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,76,Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome  is a heart condition typically triggered by severe emotional or physical stress  such as the death of a loved one. The condition predominantly affects postmenopausal women.  Slide 2: Case Introduction – Patient Demographics  Our patient  Mrs. K  is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  fitting the demographic most commonly diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. She presents with typical characteristics  being postmenopausal and without significant prevalence of coronary artery disease.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Mrs. K does not have a history of heart diseases or hypertension. She is a non-smoker  exercises regularly and maintains a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fats. Her past medical history also includes treated stage I breast cancer from 8 years ago and she is in full remission.   Slide 4: Trigger Event Mrs. K recently lost her husband  a tremendously distressing event  which is a common trigger for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 5: Presenting Symptoms Following her husband's funeral  Mrs. K experienced acute chest pain  shortness of breath  and collapsed. EMS was called  and upon their arrival they found her in moderate distress with stable vitals.  Slide 6: Diagnosis and Tests At the hospital  EKG showed ST-segment elevation. Echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesis. Coronary angiography  however  didn't show any obstructive coronary disease. Her Troponin levels were also significantly raised. These findings lead to the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Treatment and Recovery Treatment primarily consisted of supportive care  including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  aspirin  and beta-blockers. Mrs. K was advised to participate in psychotherapy to manage the emotional stress  given its role in her heart condition.   Slide 8: Conclusion  At a 2-month follow-up  Mrs. K reported no chest pain or dyspnea  her EKG results had returned to normal  and subsequent echocardiography showed complete resolution of the previous wall motion abnormalities  consistent with the typical recovery process of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,82,Title: A Case Presentation on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  or stress cardiomyopathy  is an acute  transient  and non-ischemic heart condition typically characterized by a sudden onset chest pain or dyspnea in response to severe stress. The condition is often associated with left ventricular dysfunction.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our case is a 72-year-old Caucasian female. She is a retired school teacher and active in her church. This demographic aligns with fact that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is prevalent among postmenopausal women and the mean age is in the early 70s.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes but these are well-controlled with medications. She has no known history of coronary artery disease or any psychiatric diagnosed illness. No history of smoking or alcohol consumption.   Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms   Patient presented at the emergency department with severe chest pain and dyspnea that started suddenly following the death of her spouse. She describes the pain as severe  localized to the center of her chest and radiating to her left arm.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Work Up  On examination  blood pressure was 165/95 mmHg  heart rate 110 bpm  and respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Troponin was elevated at 1.5 ng/ml. Coronary angiography showed no significant blockage in the coronary arteries. Left ventriculogram demonstrated apical ballooning with a preserved basal segment  characteristic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6: Management and Patient's Progress  The patient was managed with standard heart failure treatment: ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretic therapy  as well as supportive psychological therapy. Her symptoms gradually improved over the following week and a repeat echocardiogram showed improvement in left ventricular function  confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Conclusion  This case exemplifies the typical patient profile and presentation for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. It is critical for clinicians to consider this diagnosis in the differential for acute coronary syndrome  especially with a known exposure to severe emotional or physical stress  characteristic imaging findings  and absence of obstructive coronary disease. Timely diagnosis and appropriate management may contribute to better prognosis.   Slide 8: References  - References of articles and clinical studies utilized in this case presentation. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,83,Title: Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in Postmenopausal Women   Slide 1: Introduction: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) also known as Broken Heart Syndrome  transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome  or stress cardiomyopathy  is a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy typically precipitated by intense emotional stress.   Slide 2: Demographics & Risk Factors   TCM disproportionately affects females  particularly postmenopausal women aged 58-75 years. It is estimated that 90% of reported cases are in women. The precise reason for this disparity is unknown  but hormonal considerations may play a role.   Slide 3: Case Presentation   Patient Profile:  Mrs. B  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presents with acute chest pain. She has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  well-controlled with medication. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Five days ago  she suffered the sudden death of her husband.  Slide 4: Presentation & Symptoms   Today  Mrs. B reports intense chest pain  characteristic of cardiac angina. She describes it as a sharp  piercing pain radiating to her left arm. She also reports difficulty breathing  faintness  and palpitations.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Evaluation   Upon examination  ECG shows ST-segment elevation  initially suggesting acute myocardial infarction. However  Coronary angiography reveals patent coronary arteries. Echocardiogram shows left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning and preserved basal function  indicative of TCM.   Slide 6: Treatment & Management   Initial treatment involved beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and diuretics to manage Mrs. B's symptoms. Furthermore  considering the potential role of psychological stress in TCM  referral for bereavement counseling was also arranged.  Slide 7: Prognosis & Outcome   With adequate medical management and reduction of stress  prognosis in TCM is generally good. Mrs. B’s symptoms gradually alleviated  and assessed via follow-up echocardiography  her left ventricular function significantly improved within a period of 2 months.  Slide 8: Conclusion   This case illustrates the significance of recognizing TCM  a condition that most often affects postmenopausal women and can be triggered by intense emotional events. Though it can mimic acute coronary syndrome  it is necessary to establish a differential diagnosis as prognosis and management can be completely different.   Slide 9: Further Discussion  - Larger studies and longer follow-up are required to precisely define the natural history and long-term prognosis of TCM. - Relevance of stress management and counseling as a part of comprehensive care for TCM patients. - Ongoing research into potential genetic or other predisposing factors contributing to the onset in predisposed individuals.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,85,Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: Diagnosis  Management  and Outcome  Slide 1: Introducing the Patient Demographics: A 67-year-old Caucasian female   Slide 2: Medical History The patient suffers from hypertension  managed with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor  and type 2 diabetes  managed with metformin. No known history of heart disease. No smoking history or alcohol abuse. Family history includes a mother who died of a myocardial infarction at age 72  and a father who had a stroke at age 75.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms The patient presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset severe chest pain  which began several hours following the stressful event of her husband's unexpected death. Initial physical examination reveals a slightly elevated blood pressure (150/90 mmHg) and a mild tachycardia (105 beats per minute)  but otherwise unremarkable.  Slide 4: Diagnostic Process Based on the recounted stressful event and chest pain symptoms  a suspected diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is considered. Blood tests reveal elevated troponin I and creatine kinase MB  indicating myocardial injury. A 12-lead ECG reveals ST-segment elevation in the anteroseptal leads  initially suggestive of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.   Slide 5: Further Examination  Performing an echocardiogram reveals a typical finding in takotsubo cardiomyopathy: ventricular ballooning with preserved basal function  characterized by apical systolic ballooning and impaired contraction of the mid-segment of the left ventricle. There's no sign of significant coronary artery disease in the coronary angiogram.  Slide 6: Diagnosis & Treatment Diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is made based on clinical features  cardiac marker elevation  ECG changes  and characteristic ventricular changes on echocardiography absent of significant coronary artery disease. Treatment includes supportive measures with beta blockers  ACE inhibitors  aspirin and statins  and managing the patient's psychological stress.  Slide 7: Prognosis & Follow-up Most patients improve within weeks to few months. Long-term prognosis is generally good  but recurrence can occur. Following physical recovery  it's crucial to address any psychological stress. The patient was scheduled for regular follow-ups to monitor her progress and recovery.  Slide 8: Discussion & Conclusion In conclusion  takotsubo cardiomyopathy  although uncommon  is important to recognize due to its mimicry of myocardial infarction. This case underscores the importance of considering it in differential diagnosis  especially in postmenopausal women with recent extreme emotional stress. Effective management includes supportive care and stress management.  References (at the end): A list of references for the data and research used in the presentation.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,87,Title: Case Presentation - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1) Introduction  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a transient cardiac syndrome that involves left ventricular apical akinesis and mimics acute coronary syndrome. Most frequently  it occurs in postmenopausal women with a median age of 67 and has often been associated with physical or emotional stress.   Slide 2) Case Details  Our case pertains to a 72-year-old African-American  post-menopausal woman  with a history of hypertension  experiencing intense emotional stress.   Slide 3) Past Medical History  The patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension  managed using a single anti-hypertensive medication  Lisinopril. There are no notable cardiac events in her past. She has no history of diabetes or high cholesterol levels. No identified prior episodes of acute stress reaction. There is no family history of heart disease.  Slide 4) Presenting Symptoms  The patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain  difficulty breathing  nausea  and lightheadedness. These symptoms were preceded by an incidence of significant emotional stress. Physical examination revealed elevated blood pressure and tachycardia.   Slide 5) Investigation  Initial EKG showed ST segment elevation in the precordial leads  but the subsequent coronary angiogram was normal  ruling out an acute coronary syndrome. Her laboratory tests showed a slight elevation in cardiac biomarkers (troponin levels). An eventual echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning with hyperdynamic function of the basal walls of the left ventricle  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6) Management and Outcome  The patient was managed with supportive care. Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors were used for symptomatic relief. She was educated on stress management techniques and referred for counseling. With management  her symptoms resolved  and repeat echocardiogram after a few weeks showed a return to normal left ventricle function indicating a full recovery.  Slide 7) Discussion  This case provides insight into how emotional stress can cause significant physiological reactions  such as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It is important to consider this diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with symptoms mimicking acute coronary syndrome  especially when preceded by significant emotional or physical stress. The condition generally has a good prognosis  but it necessitates careful management and follow-ups.  Slide 8) Conclusion  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an important differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with chest pain  especially in the absence of coronary disease and in the presence of emotional stress. Early detection and proper management can result in a favorable outcome for the patient.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,92,Title: A Case Study: An Encounter with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  often referred to as 'broken heart syndrome'  is a transient and reversible condition characterized by acute left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (Eitel et al.  2020). It is commonly triggered by intense emotional or physical stress  resulting in symptoms similar to an acute coronary syndrome. This case study addresses a 70-year-old Caucasian female  the most commonly affected demographic group  with a history of hypertension and depression who presented with TTC (Templin et al.  2015; Ghadri et al.  2018).  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient  female  Caucasian  aged 70 years  is consistent with the patient demographics typically seen in TTC. It's frequently reported in women (90%)  particularly post-menopausal ones  with a median age of 67 years (Templin et al.  2015). Race/ethnicity demonstrates generic patterns with a slight prevalence amongst Caucasian women (Ghadri et al.  2018).  Slide 3: Patient Medical History The patient has a history of hypertension  a common comorbidity in approximately 54.4% of TTC patients (Kato et al.  2016). She was also previously diagnosed with depression. Recent literature describes a significant association between psychiatric disorders  like depression  and TTC  with prevalence rates reported between 23% to 48% in these patients (Eitel et al.  2020).  Slide 4: Case Presentation The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and breathlessness that occurred post an intense argument with a relative about two hours prior. Her ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  an initial impression inclining towards acute coronary syndrome.  Slide 5: Diagnosis Upon coronary angiography  no significant coronary artery disease was found  however  the left ventriculography demonstrated apical ballooning - a characteristic finding in TTC. Together with elevated cardiac biomarkers  transient wall motion abnormalities and relevant clinical history  the patient was diagnosed with TTC (Eitel et al.  2020).  Slide 6: Treatment and Prognosis The patient was started on ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics in the acute phase. Emotional stress management was emphasized due to the psychiatric history. The follow-up showed gradual recovery over eight weeks. She had joined a stress management and meditation course  and her antidepressants were revised. TTC has a generally favorable prognosis however risk of recurrence exists and psychological care is crucial in these patients (Eitel et al.  2020).  Slide 7: Conclusion TTC is a critical reminder of the mind-heart connection  and its diagnosis requires awareness of its existence in patients  particularly post-menopausal women  presenting with chest pain and dyspnea after intense emotional stress. Careful emotional history-taking  attention to psychiatric comorbidities  and psychosocial care are pivotal to manage and prevent recurrence in these patients.  References: [Listed here]

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,95,Slide 1:  Title: Case Study - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in an Elderly Female Patient  Slide 2:  Title: Patient Demographics Content: Our case involves a 75-year-old Caucasian female patient. Literature suggests Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome  predominantly affects postmenopausal women (89%-100% of TCM cases).  Slide 3:  Title: Past Medical History Content: The patient has a history of hypertension controlled with medication. There's no prior record of coronary artery disease  valvular disease  or other cardiovascular diseases. She has not been previously diagnosed with any form of heart illness. She's a non-smoker and denies alcohol use.  Slide 4: Title: Recent Emotional Stress Content: The patient recently lost her husband of 50 years  a highly stressful event. TCM often follows periods of severe emotional stress  suggesting a possible connection between this recent event and the onset of the patient's condition.  Slide 5: Title: Presentation Content: The patient arrived at the hospital complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. Her symptoms mimic that of an acute myocardial infarction  although there is no evidence of obstructive coronary disease.  Slide 6:  Title: Examination Findings Content: An EKG shows ST-segment elevation  and troponin levels were elevated. But coronary angiography didn’t show any significant blockages  pointing towards a diagnosis of TCM.  Slide 7: Title: Diagnosis  Content: Combining incident timing  physical symptoms  and test results  the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 8: Title: Outcome and Follow-up Content: The patient was treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors)  β-blockers  and is advised to engage in stress management activities like therapy  gentle exercises  and meditation. TCM prognosis is usually good  and we expect a full recovery with continuous monitoring and careful management.  Slide 9:  Title: Conclusion  Content: This case underlies the importance of considering Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in differential diagnosis  especially in elderly women presenting with chest pain and emotional distress. Prompt detection and appropriate treatment can lead to good recovery and outcome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,96,"Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Slide 1: Introduction - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as """"Broken Heart Syndrome"""" is a form of transient heart failure usually triggered by severe emotional or physiological stress. - Predominantly seen in postmenopausal women with a 9:1 female to male ratio. - Represents about 2% of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACs).  Slide 2: Patient Demographics - Patient: 70-year-old Asian woman. - Occupation: Retired teacher. - Marital Status: Widowed for 10 years.  - Lifestyle: Non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol.  Slide 3: Patient’s Past Medical History - Hypertension controlled with medication. - Type 2 diabetes managed with diet and oral hypoglycemics. - History of depression following her husband's death.   Slide 4: Presenting Complaint - Patient experienced severe chest pain and shortness of breath following news of her grandson’s severe accident.  Slide 5: Clinical Examination  - BP: 160/95 mmHg; HR: 103 bpm; Resp. Rate: 22 breaths/minute; Temp: 98.6°F - Cardiovascular examination suggested ST-segment elevation on ECG.  Slide 6: Investigations & Diagnosis - High levels of cardiac troponin suggesting myocardial injury. - Coronary angiogram revealed no significant coronary artery disease. - Echocardiogram: Hyperkinetic basal segments  hypokinetic mid and apical ventricular segments  creating an apical ballooning appearance - consistent with TCM.  Slide 7: Treatment - Since TCM mimics acute coronary syndrome  initially treated with aspirin  low molecular weight heparin  and beta-blockers. - Her emotional stress was also managed with anxiolytics  and talk therapy.  Slide 8: Outcome & Follow-up - Patient's cardiac function normalized within 2 months evidenced by follow-up echocardiogram. - Psychotherapy for better stress management and prevention of recurrent episodes.  Slide 9: Conclusion  - It's crucial to consider TCM in differential diagnosis for older women presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome  especially in the context of significant emotional stress.  - Management of emotional stress is just as vital as the physical symptoms in managing TCM."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,97,Title: Case Presentation: A 69-year-old Female with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Patient Demographics - Patient: Female - Age: 69 years - Ethnicity: Caucasian  - Occupation: Retired School Teacher - Marital Status: Widowed  Slide 2: Relevant Past Medical History - Mild hypertension  controlled with Lisinopril - Type 2 diabetes  managed with Metformin - Regular physical activities  non-smoker - GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder)  managed with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)  Slide 3: Presenting Issue The patient recently attended her husband's funeral and during the event  experienced a 'tight chest' with moderate shortness of breath.   Slide 4: Examination & Investigations On examination  patient was conscious but anxious and pale. ECG showed ST elevations with T-wave inversion in lateral leads. Troponin I levels were substantially elevated. Urgent coronary angiography did not reveal significant coronary artery disease  however  left ventriculogram showed apical ballooning.  Slide 5: Diagnosis Based on the unexpected emotional stress  clinical findings  elevated cardiac markers yet normal coronary arteries and characteristic appearance on ventriculogram  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome) was established.  Slide 6: Literature Review Takotsubo cardiomyopathy commonly affects postmenopausal women (75-89% of cases) typically between ages 58-75. The syndrome is often precipitated by severe emotional stress  supporting the patient's circumstance. Our patient's history of anxiety may have increased her susceptibility to this stress-induced cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Management Initial management included cardiac monitoring  aspirin  and heparin drip while awaiting angiogram. Post-diagnosis Beta blockers  ACE inhibitors  and anxiolytic were introduced  with a recommendation for ongoing CBT to manage her GAD.   Slide 8: Follow-up and Prognosis Our patient will be closely monitored and given a tailored cardiac rehabilitation program. Repeat imaging is expected to show recovery over a few weeks-months. Generally  the prognosis for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is good  with most patients demonstrating complete recovery  albeit some can experience long-term heart failure or recurrence.  Slide 9: Conclusion This case highlights the relationship between emotional stress and the onset of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Continued research and awareness of this syndrome  particularly in postmenopausal women and individuals with a history of anxiety  is crucial to ensure accurate diagnosis and management.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,3,99,"Title: A Case Presentation on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction Our patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian female presenting with symptoms suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. Our research shows that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is more prevalent in postmenopausal women  with a mean age of 67-75 years and typically of Caucasian ethnicity.  Slide 2: Past Medical History The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin  respectively. She also has a 10-year history of anxiety and depression  previously treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Recent studies have shown a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric diseases such as anxiety and depression in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms The patient reports a sudden onset of severe  substernal chest pain after hearing news of her sister's unexpected passing- a high emotional stress event. The pain was described as """"heavy """" radiating to the left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath. Stress-related triggers are common in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 4: Clinical Examination Physical examination revealed tachycardia and a systolic murmur. An ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  suggesting anterior wall myocardial ischemia. However  cardiac biomarkers (troponin) were only marginally elevated  inconsistent with a typical myocardial infarction.  Slide 5: Further Investigations An echocardiogram revealed dyskinesia of the left ventricular apex with preserved basal function  also known as apical ballooning  which is a characteristic feature of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiography was performed  which showed no significant obstructive lesions  further suggesting Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Slide 6: Diagnosis and Management  The diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made based on the Mayo Clinic criteria – transient hypokinesis  akinesis  or dyskinesis of the left ventricular mid-segments with apical involvement; absence of obstructive coronary disease; new ECG abnormalities  and absence of pheochromocytoma and myocarditis. The patient was managed with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to help reduce cardiac workload and to improve cardiac function.  Slide 7: Conclusion Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  while often mistaken for acute coronary syndrome due to similar presenting symptoms  has distinctive hallmarks such as identifiable stressor events  specific wall motion abnormalities  and the absence of significant obstructive coronary lesions. Timely recognition and appropriate management of this condition can lead to complete recovery. "

Through this review  we strive to improve our collective understanding and management of this multifaceted cardiac disorder  often called Broken heart syndrome.  Slide 2: Title: Demographics Content: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy predominantly affects postmenopausal women between 58 - 75 years of age. Approximately 90% of reported cases are in women  often sparked by severe emotional stress.  Slide 3: Title: Case Introduction Content: This presentation spotlights a typical case: a 68-year-old postmenopausal woman. She is a non-smoker  consumes alcohol occasionally and leads a minimally active lifestyle.   Slide 4: Title: Past Medical History Content: Our patient was known as having mild hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both under control with medication. She had no previous history of heart disease. Faced with a significant emotional stressor  following the death of her husband  she came to the ER  experiencing symptoms reminiscent of an acute coronary syndrome.  Slide 5: Title: Clinical Presentation Content: In the ER  the patient reported acute chest pain and shortness of breath. Stress-related Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is often mistaken for a heart attack  given the overlapping symptoms in initial presentation.  Slide 6:  Title: Diagnosis Content: The diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was confirmed using electrocardiogram  cardiac biomarkers  coronary angiography  and echocardiography. The critical distinguishing feature is the absence of obstructive coronary disease.  Slide 7:  Title: Treatment Content: The patient was managed supportively with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors  alongside encouragement for lifestyle modifications like stress management. The long-term prognosis was explained as fairly good  although relapses are possible.

However  given the presentation  there is concern for takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,22,A 72-year-old Caucasian woman presents with acute onset of chest pain at rest  rising anxiety and severe dyspnea. Her past medical history includes hypertension and major depressive disorder. Physical examination reveals diaphoresis  tachycardia and hypotension. Her electrocardiogram shows ST segment elevation in the anterolateral leads  troponin is elevated and echocardiography demonstrates apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved basal function  suggesting takotsubo cardiomyopathy. No recent stressful physical or emotional incidents were reported in the patient's history.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,23,A 70-year-old Caucasian woman presents with severe  sudden chest pain resembling a heart attack. Her medical history includes postmenopausal status and a prior history of anxiety disorder. She reports that she has been under an increased level of emotional stress due to a recent bereavement. Her symptoms started suddenly  shortly after receiving news of a close family member's unexpected death. On a scale of 1-10  she rates her pain a 9  describing it as a crushing sensation. She reports feeling light-headed  excessively fatigued  and short of breath  which are uncharacteristic symptoms for her typical anxiety episodes. She has neither a personal history of coronary artery disease  nor a family history of early heart disease. She reports good compliance with her prescribed SSRI  exercises regularly  and abstains from tobacco  illicit drugs  and alcohol use.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,24,A 68-year-old postmenopausal woman presents to the emergency department accompanied by her daughter. The patient reports a sudden onset of severe chest pain and difficulty breathing which started two hours ago. She also reports feelings of extreme emotional distress  having just learnt of the sudden death of her longtime friend. Her past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and unremarkable for cardiovascular diseases. She denies any history of smoking  alcohol consumption  or illicit drug use. She has no known history of coronary artery disease or previous myocardial infarction.  On examination  the patient appears distressed. Vital signs show tachycardia and mild hypertension. Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation. However  subsequent cardiac catheterization does not reveal significant coronary artery disease that could explain the ECG changes and her severe symptoms. High levels of cardiac biomarkers in the blood suggest a heart problem. An echocardiogram and ventriculogram reveals apical ballooning of the left ventricle  leading to the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy. The patient’s severe emotional stress and the cardiac findings in the absence of significant coronary artery disease are key features supporting this diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,25,A 72-year-old post-menopausal Caucasian woman presents with acute chest pain and dyspnea that mimics myocardial infarction (MI). She has a recent history of severe emotional stress due to the sudden death of her spouse.

She has no known history of coronary artery disease  and she denies any past cardiac problems. She has never smoked  is a moderate drinker  leads a physically active life  has a balanced diet  and has a familial history of cardiovascular diseases. Her physical exam is notable for elevated heart rate and blood pressure  and EKG shows ST-segment elevation. Troponin levels are also increased. Her symptoms resemble acute myocardial infarction  but given the atypical patient profile and specific circumstances  a suspected diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) is made.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,72,A 71-year-old Caucasian female with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia presents with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath following a sudden stressful event. The pain is similar to the one described in myocardial infarction but investigations do not show any signs of obstructive coronary artery disease. Electrocardiography reveals ST-segment elevation. The echocardiogram shows apical ballooning and reduced ejection fraction consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patient reports having experienced a similar episode following a stressful event 2 years ago but did not seek medical attention then. Her current stress tests are normal and troponin levels are mildly elevated. She is currently taking lisinopril and atorvastatin for her hypertension and hyperlipidaemia.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,73,A 72-year-old Caucasian female with a history of depression and anxiety is presenting with symptoms of chest pain  palpitations  fainting and shortness of breath. The patient's symptoms occurred suddenly after receiving news of her husband’s death. She has hypertension that is managed with medication. Furthermore  she does not have a history of alcohol consumption or smoking  and lives with her daughter. Her family history is significant for myocardial infarction in her mother. Currently  she is experiencing severe stress and grieving. These symptoms are suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This clinical picture is consistent with the demographic generally affected by takotsubo cardiomyopathy as it is more common in postmenopausal women who have just experienced a major stressful event. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,74,"A 68-year-old British Caucasian woman presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain at rest  which has been ongoing for a few hours. She has a significant past medical history of hypertension  which has been well-managed with prescription medication. As a recent widow who lived a previously stressful life due to her husband's terminal illness  she has reported feelings of anxiety and depression. Additionally  her social history is marked by social isolation and loneliness after her husband's death nine months ago. She denies a personal history of smoking or alcohol abuse  she followed a balanced diet  and performed regular exercise until 9 months ago.   At presentation  patient is visibly distressed and reports feeling """"like she is going to pass out."""" Neurologic evaluation is normal but cardiovascular exam reveals tachycardia. Her symptoms onset were sudden  occurring at the height of her distress. These symptoms are suggestive of acute coronary syndrome but given her precipitating intense emotional distress  takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""") is a primary differential diagnosis."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,75,Patient is a 68-year-old widowed Caucasian woman  who presents to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The symptoms began suddenly  following the death of her husband six months ago. She describes the pain as a tight  gripping pain in the center of her chest that radiates to her left arm. She admits to finding it difficult to cope with her bereavement  reports increased stress  poor sleep  and no exercise since her husband's passing.  She has a 10-year history of well-controlled hypertension using Lisinopril. Her brother had a heart attack at the age of 74. She has no previous history of coronary artery disease  chest pain  dyslipidemia  smoking  substance abuse or diabetes. She has had no previous hospitalizations or surgeries.  On physical examination  she appears anxious and diaphoretic. Cardiovascular exam reveals tachycardia and a systolic murmur. No jugular venous distention or peripheral edema is observed. The respiratory exam reveals normal breath sounds with no crackles or wheezes. Neurological examination is unremarkable.   The presentation of acute  severe chest pain and shortness of breath  an increased stress with grief and bereavement  a family history of cardiac disease  and her age and sex suggest Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome) as a likely diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,76,An 68-year-old Caucasian female presents with severe chest pain and shortness of breath following a significant emotional stressor  the sudden death of her husband. She has no past medical history of coronary artery disease or hypertension. The chest pain resembles that of a heart attack and is not relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. On examination  there is evidence of tachycardia and cardiogenic shock. An EKG demonstrated ST-segment elevation. Diagnostic procedures including cardiac catheterization showed no evidence of blockage in the coronary arteries indicative of typical myocardial infarction  however a ventriculogram revealed abnormalities typical of takotsubo cardiomyopathy with significant hypokinesis/akinesis of the mid-left ventricle with apical ballooning. The troponin level was elevated  further mimicking findings in an acute coronary syndrome. The patient was immediately managed to stabilize her cardiac function.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,77,A 63-year-old  post-menopausal Caucasian woman presents to the emergency department complaining of acute chest pain and shortness of breath  symptoms which closely resemble those of a myocardial infarction. The patient has a history of major depressive disorder and an acute stressor in the form of the recent death of her husband. She has no known history of coronary artery disease  hypertension  or diabetes. She is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption. Her EKG shows inverted T-waves  ST-segment elevation  and prolonged QT interval. Echocardiography shows apical ballooning of the left ventricle  with preserved basal function indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often known as broken-heart syndrome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,78,A 72-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia comes in complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that began suddenly approximately 4 hours ago after she received news of the death of a close friend. The pain is described as a heaviness in the centre of her chest  radiating towards her left shoulder and arm  similar to descriptions of anginal pain. EKG shows ST-segment elevation while her troponin levels are slightly elevated. The patient reports no recent use of drugs  alcohol or tobacco. She also denies having previous symptoms similar to the current presentation. She mentions she has been under significant emotional stress due to her friend's illness and subsequent death. Based on the sudden onset of severe chest pain following a significant emotional event in an elderly woman with common risk factors  there is a strong clinical suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,79,A 72-year old widowed Caucasian female presents with an acute onset of severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations. She reported that these symptoms started a few hours after she received news about her son's death from an automobile accident. She has a past medical history of hypertension and major depressive disorder. She denies smoking  alcohol consumption  or drug use. Prior to this incident  she was living independently and was able to perform all activities of daily living. There are no reported allergies. Examination reveals an anxious  diaphoretic woman with tachycardia and hypotension. ECG shows ST-segment elevations on the precordial leads consistent with an anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  catheterization did not show significant coronary artery disease but showed left ventricular apical ballooning suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,80,Patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian female  recently widowed  presenting with severe chest pain mimicking a heart attack  associated with dyspnea and lightheadedness. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and was exposed to intense emotional stress following the sudden death of her husband two weeks ago. She is a nonsmoker  denies alcohol consumption and has no family history of early heart disease. Her medications include lisinopril and atorvastatin. Labs reveal elevated troponins and an EKG shows ST-segment elevation but without pathological Q-waves or evidence of atherosclerotic plaque rupture on coronary angiography. An echocardiogram reveals left ventricular dysfunction  specifically apical ballooning. Both the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings are consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,81,A 68-year-old Caucasian woman presents with a sudden onset of severe chest pain  intermittent shortness of breath  nausea  and palpitations. The symptoms started a couple of hours after she received news about her husband's sudden death. She has a past medical history significant for non-controlled type 2 diabetes for the past 10 years  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. She has been a non-smoker and only drinks alcohol occasionally. She lives alone and recently retired from her job. Physical examination reveals diaphoresis  tachycardia with a rate of 105 beats per minute  blood pressure of 170/95 mmHg  and slight wheezing on lung auscultation. Her diverced brother died of myocardial infarction at the age of 62. She has been medicating with metformin and amlodipine.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,82,"A 72-year-old widowed Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with chest pain. The pain started after she received news about the sudden death of her only son yesterday. She describes it as a pressure-like feeling  located in the middle of her chest and rated it as 8/10. She also has associated shortness of breath  nausea  and sweating. She has no previous history of heart disease but has a 10-year history of controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. On examination  she appears anxious. Blood pressure is elevated  and heart rate is rapid. There is no leg swelling or jugular vein distention. The rest of the cardiovascular exam is normal. Chest x-ray and pulmonary exam show no signs of lung disease. The initial EKG shows ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. However  an emergency coronary angiogram shows no coronary artery occlusion. Given the acute emotional trauma and clinical presentation  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (or """"broken heart syndrome"""") is considered."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,83,A 68-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of hypertension and a recent significant emotional stress presents with acute chest pain  similar to severe angina. She reports dyspnea  and a subjective feeling of 'palpitations'. On examination  she has tachycardia  and EKG shows slight ST-segment elevation. The patient does not have any past history of coronary artery disease. Her primary care doctor increased the dosage of her antihypertensive medication a month ago due to poorly controlled blood pressure. The chest pain occurred suddenly while she was thinking about her husband who passed away recently. Hospital admission and further cardiac investigation strongly suggest takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,84,A 68-year-old Caucasian female presents with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  along with lightheadedness and vomiting. She recently underwent the death of her husband and had been under immense emotional stress as a result. She has a past medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism  which are managed by medications. She doesn't smoke and her family history is not significant for any heart disease. Her EKG shows ST-level elevations mimicking ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and echocardiogram shows akinesis in the mid and apical segments of the left ventricle with preserved basal function. The coronary angiogram didn't show any significant coronary artery disease  leading to a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,85,A 68-year-old postmenopausal woman with a past medical history of hypertension presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain that radiates to her left arm  discomfort  and sweating. The onset was acute and occurred immediately after she received news of her son's unexpected death. Upon examination  she is tachycardic and reveals shallow breathing. Her EKG reveals significant ST-segment elevation  but troponin levels are only mildly elevated. Echocardiogram shows apical ballooning and contraction abnormalities consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,86,"A 68-year-old post-menopausal woman presents with a sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. She has a past medical history notable for well-controlled hypertension and she lost her husband just a week ago. She is a teetotaler and non-smoker. Her maternal grandmother had a history of heart disease. Emergency department vitals indicate she has an elevated blood pressure of 168/95 mmHg  a heart rate of 90 bpm  and oxygen saturation of 92%. Examination reveals mild bilateral pedal edema. EKG shows ST-segment elevation  while her laboratory findings indicate moderately elevated troponin levels. These symptoms and findings  combined with severely emotional event suggest a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome""""."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,87,"Patient Demographics: 68-year-old postmenopausal woman  Medical History: Patient has history of hypertension treated with losartan  no previous cardiac history  and recently underwent extreme emotional stress due to the sudden passing of her loving spouse. There are no known drug allergies reported.  Presentation: Patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset severe chest pain  which she describes as a """"sudden  severe crushing sensation"""" in the center of her chest  radiating to her left shoulder and arm. She also reports associated shortness of breath and palpitations. Onset was at rest and the pain was not relieved by nitroglycerin. She denies associated nausea  vomiting  diaphoresis  or other systemic symptoms. She denies any recent physical trauma or illness.  Examination: On examination  she appeared distressed with beads of sweat on her forehead  but conscious and oriented. Blood pressure was mildly elevated at 150/90 mmHg. Heart rate regular and rapid at 110 bpm  with no audible murmurs. Chest examination and the rest of the physical examination were normal.  ED Investigations: Repeat ECG showed ST-elevation in leads V1-V4 and T-wave inversion  troponin was significantly elevated. These findings raise suspicion for acute coronary syndrome. However  the patient's ventriculogram showed apical ballooning and basal hypercontractility  consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (or """"broken heart syndrome"""").  Impression: This patient likely has Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  an acute illness characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction  which is often triggered by physical or emotional stress. Despite the presentation resembling acute MI  coronary angiography usually does not detect significant obstructive coronary artery disease. Formal confirmation will be done with cardiac catheterization  although treatment with beta blockers and ACE inhibitors is already started."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,88,A 68-year-old postmenopausal woman with a history of hypertension and chronic anxiety presents with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The symptoms have started suddenly after receiving distressing news about the death of a close friend. The chest pain is described as similar to a crushing sensation  similar to past anxiety attacks  but much more intense. She further reports associated nausea  diaphoresis and a feeling of impending doom. The patient has a family history of ischemic heart disease but is a lifelong non-smoker with no history of alcohol abuse or illicit drug use. Her medications include Lisinopril and a benzodiazepine for her anxiety disorder. This patient’s presentation is strongly suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced (broken-heart syndrome) cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,89,A 74-year-old widowed Caucasian woman presents to the emergency department with acute chest discomfort  pressure  and shortness of breath. She has no known medical history but mentions she has been experiencing intense emotional stress due to the recent death of her husband. She describes the pain as severe  felt in the middle of her chest  and radiating to her arms. Additionally  she reports lightheadedness and nausea. She denies any history of coronary artery disease  hypertension  diabetes  or any other heart diseases in the past. In view of her age  sex  acute severe chest pain  and recent extreme emotional stress  takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken-heart syndrome) is highly suspected.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,90,A 68-year-old Caucasian woman presents to the emergency room with acute onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. Intermittent lightheadedness started about 2 hours ago  but progressively worsened. Patient denies having any other associated symptoms like fever  cough  abdominal pain  nausea  vomiting  palpitations  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or recent illnesses increasing her stress levels. Her past medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis without any history of heart disease or hypertension. She is a nonsmoker and takes methotrexate and alendronate regularly. The patient was recently widowed and admits to being under immense emotional distress. On examination  she appears anxious with elevated blood pressure and tachycardia. There was no jugular venous distention  cardiac examination yielded normal S1  S2  without any murmurs and lung fields were clear to auscultation bilaterally. She has no peripheral edema or cyanosis. Initial EKG shows ST segment elevations in the anterior leads and Troponin T level is elevated. The suspicion of acute coronary syndrome is high  but the overall clinical picture raises suspicion for stress-induced takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,91,A 68-year-old Caucasian postmenopausal woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain and dyspnea. The chest pain is described as pressure-like  located in the substernal area  and radiated to the left shoulder. She denies associated symptoms of nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis. She reports a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and recently experienced a stressful emotional event due her husband's death. Her medications include aspirin  atorvastatin  and lisinopril. Her vitals on presentation include a blood pressure of 148/90  a heart rate of 102  respiratory rate of 22  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. She has a prior history of smoking  approximately 1 pack per day for 10 years  but quit 20 years ago. Physical examination is significant for tachycardia  but is otherwise within normal limits. Her initial EKG shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  raising concern for acute myocardial infarction. However  the cardiac enzymes  troponin levels are significantly raised. She was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  sometimes referred to as Broken Heart Syndrome. The pattern of this patient's symptoms  her prior stressful event  and her demographic are consistent with a high likelihood of this syndrome rather than a typical myocardial infarction.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,92,"A 69-year-old  postmenopausal Caucasian woman presents with acute onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath. Her medical history is marked by hypertension and depression but lacks any history of coronary artery disease. She recently underwent the death of her spouse  which had caused considerable emotional stress. On presentation  she has T-wave inversions on her ECG  and her cardiac biomarkers are slightly elevated. Her echocardiography shows apical ballooning of the left ventricle  indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Despite presenting like an acute coronary syndrome  the patient's coronary angiography does not show any significant obstruction. Her cardiovascular dysfunction is likely secondary to a severe emotional stressor  meeting the criteria for takotsubo cardiomyopathy(also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""")."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,93,A 68-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian female with a history of major depressive disorder presents to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. These symptoms developed suddenly after she received news of the unexpected death of a close relative. She describes the chest pain as a sensation of heaviness and pressure that radiates to her jaw and left arm. She also reports feeling faint  extreme fatigue  and moderate anxiety. Her past medical history reveals no known heart disease or risk factors for ischemic heart disease such as smoking  diabetes  or hypertension.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,5,100,A 68-year-old post-menopausal Caucasian female presents to the ED with severe chest pain and dyspnea. The pain began suddenly during a family gathering  following the unexpected announcement of her daughter's divorce. Her past medical history is notable for hypertension and mild asthma  for which she takes regular medications. She denies smoking  alcohol  or illicit drug use. On examination  she appears distressed  and her vital signs reveal mild tachypnea and elevated blood pressure. Electrocardiogram reveals ST-segment elevation  and laboratory investigation indicates elevated troponin levels. The chest pain is not significantly relieved after administering sublingual nitroglycerine. The overall clinical presentation suggests acute coronary syndrome  but coronary angiography shows no significant stenosis or clot. Echocardiogram  however  reveals apical ballooning of the left ventricle  suggesting the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  triggered by intense emotional stress. She reports no prior episodes of similar symptoms.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,1,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 70-year-old Asian female patient presenting to the emergency department with severe chest pain onset 1 hour ago. She has a history of anxiety disorder and hypertension. She does not have prior history of coronary artery disease or cardiac disorders. Her medication regimen includes Escitalopram for anxiety and Hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. The patient is widowed  lives alone and recently experienced a stressful life event - the death of her eldest son.  Overview: The demographic and medical history of the patient aligns with the common profile of a Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM) patient as represented in various literature. TCM often presents in postmenopausal women  with a higher prevalence among Asians. The disorder is frequently precipitated by a physically or emotionally stressful event. This patient's severe chest pain  comparable to a myocardial infarction  possibly suggests TCM. The condition  also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  mimics symptoms of a heart attack.  Relevant Medical History: The patient's history of anxiety could be a potential contributing factor to her presenting symptoms  as psychological stress is a known trigger for TCM. Her hypertension  though controlled  could put her at a higher risk for cardiovascular problems. However  the lack of history of coronary artery disease or cardiac disorders is consistent with TCM  as unlike heart attacks  TCM often occurs in patients with no past cardiac issues.  Social History: This patient's recent stressful event  the death of her eldest son  could be the emotional trigger for her current symptoms  as TCM is often precipitated by extreme stress.  Conclusion: Given this patient's demographic characteristics  past medical and social history  her symptoms could suggest a potential case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Particularly  the severe chest pain onset following a major life stressor in a postmenopausal woman with a history of a mental health disorder (anxiety)  points towards this diagnosis. This presentation highlights the need for further diagnostic investigations including electrocardiogram (ECG)  cardiac biomarkers  and potentially coronary angiography to confirm a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,2,Patient Profile: Patient: Mrs. A  female  aged 68. Ethnicity: Caucasian.  Occupicance: Retired school teacher. Living situation: Recently widowed  living alone. Area of Residence: Suburban.  Relevant Medical History: 1. Hypertension  diagnosed 9 years ago. Controlled on medication. 2. Dyslipidemia  diagnosed 7 years ago. Controlled on medication. 3. No known allergies. 4. Family history of ischemic heart disease. 5. Non-smoker and occasional alcohol consumer. 6. Underwent stress therapy after husband's death about six months ago. 7. No history of past hospitalizations or surgeries.  Presenting complaints: 1. Chest pain upon exertion. 2. Shortness of breath. 3. Palpitations. 4. Feeling of impending doom.  Investigations unveiled ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads but coronary arteries were found to be normal in coronary angiography. Further examination with ventriculography showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with sparing of the base  pointing towards the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Problem Representation: Mrs. A  a 68-year-old Caucasian female with a significant past history of hypertension and dyslipidemia  presented with the acute onset of exertional chest pain  breathlessness  palpitations  and a feeling of impending doom. Symptoms emerged in a context of recent emotional stress due to spousal loss. She has a family history of ischaemic heart disease  but neither smokes nor consumes alcohol regularly. Clinical investigation demonstrated electrocardiogram changes consistent with an acute coronary syndrome  despite the absence of obstructive coronary disease on angiography. There was  however  a notable finding of the classical 'apical ballooning' of the left ventricle on ventriculography  which is consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Analysis: As per the available literature  the majority of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy cases occur in postmenopausal women with a mean age of 66-77 years  consistent with our patient  Mrs. A's profile. The disease is often triggered by physical or emotional stress  which  in Mrs. A's case  could be the loss of her husband. Her medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia further increases her risk for cardiovascular events. The presentation is often indistinguishable from acute coronary syndromes  as seen in Mrs. A  which necessitates further investigation to arrive at the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,3,Problem Representation:  Patient Information: - Gender: Female (As per literature  90% of reported cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are in women) - Age: 65 - 75 years (The average age of patients diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is often post-menopausal) - Ethnicity: Any (Although Takotsubo originated in Japan  it has been diagnosed worldwide across several ethnic groups) - Occupation: Retired (Due to age)  Presenting Complaint: - The patient presented with severe chest pain  similar to a heart attack. - The onset of this episode was sudden and occurred a couple of hours before coming to the hospital.  Past Medical History: - Frequent severe emotional or physical stress. Most cases are precipitated by severe stress. - History of Hypertension. Many patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy have a history of hypertension. - No previous history of angina  myocardial infarction or other heart diseases. - No diabetes mellitus or other metabolic diseases. - No previous history of substance abuse or psychotropic medication.  Family History: - No known genetic or hereditary factors associated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy but a general cardiovascular diseases history is present in her family.  Social History: - Lives alone after her husband's death  which is an emotionally distressing event. - Moderate alcohol consumption and no smoking history.  Investigation Results: - Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation - a pattern often seen in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. - Echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle and contractile dysfunction  which are characteristic for a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. - Serum cardiac biomarkers (troponin and creatine kinase) were elevated. - Coronary angiogram didn’t show significant blockages which would otherwise suggest a typical heart attack.  Diagnosis: -Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (or stress cardiomyopathy).
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,4,Patient Profile:  Name: Jane  Gender: Female  Age: 75  Race: Asian  Occupation: Retired school teacher  Marital Status: Widowed  Children: 2  Presenting Problem:  Jane presented in the Emergency Department (ED) with acute chest pain  shortness of breath  and fainting spells  which started abruptly an hour ago. She describes the pain as intense  gripping in nature  and located predominantly in the central chest  radiating towards the neck area.  Past Medical History (PMH):  - Hypertension (controlled on Metoprolol) - Type 2 Diabetes (controlled on Metformin) - Cholecystectomy 10 years ago - No known history of heart disease   Social History (SH):  - She used to smoke 1 pack a day but quit 20 years ago.  - She drinks alcohol socially.  - She lives alone  with monthly visits from her children.  Review of Systems (ROS):  Jane also reported generalized weakness  sweating  and nausea along with chest pain. She has been feeling increasingly tired and under stress due to recently managing her husband's funeral. No complaints regarding any recent changes in vision  hearing  mood swings  or weight changes  etc.   Presumptive Diagnosis:  Considering Jane's age  gender  presenting complaints  and recently experienced severe emotional stress  there is a high suspicion of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (or Broken Heart Syndrome).  Plan: Admission to the Cardiology Department  cardiology consultation  ordering diagnostic investigations like ECG  echocardiogram  cardiac MRI  and comprehensive metabolic panel  and initiating supportive treatment.  Notes:  - Takotsubo cardiomyopathy more commonly affects postmenopausal women  typically after an intense emotional or physical stress. - Approximately 5 -10% of female patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome have takotsubo cardiomyopathy. - Asians appear to be at elevated risk for developing takotsubo.

Summary: It is known that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also called stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes acutely weak and mimics the characteristics of a severe heart attack. Studies indicate that patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy are predominantly postmenopausal women and a significant proportion of them has a history of a recent physical or emotional stress trigger. This patient's demographic profile  presenting symptoms and stress history are thus highly typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,6,Patient Profile: Name: Mrs. Esther Jones Age: 69 years old Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher Marital status: Widowed Living condition: Lives alone in a suburban area  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Jones has a history of Type 2 diabetes  for which she has been on Metformin for 10 years. Additionally  she was recently diagnosed with hyperlipidaemia which is managed through dietary measures. She also has osteoporosis and takes Calcium and Vitamin D supplements. There is no history of any significant cardiovascular diseases  including hypertension or ischemic heart disease.  Recent event:  Three weeks ago  Mrs. Jones lost her son in a tragic car accident. She reported feeling an immense amount of stress and emotional distress since the incident.  Presenting complaint: Mrs. Jones arrived in the emergency room complaining of sudden severe chest pain. The pain is described as sharp  located in the center of the chest  radiating to the left arm. Associated symptoms include shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and nausea.   This scenario is representative for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy which typically affects postmenopausal women and can be brought about by severe emotional stress. The symptoms often mimic those of an acute myocardial infarction. Understanding the precise demographics and past medical history can assist with the correct diagnosis and patient management.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,7,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 66-year-old Caucasian female  recently widowed. She lives alone and has been experiencing increased levels of stress due to the loss of her spouse. She has a BMI of 25  noting slight overweight. She is a non-smoker. She consumes alcohol moderately and has a routine of daily physical activity  mainly walks in the park.  Presenting Symptoms: She comes in complaining of severe chest pain and is experiencing shortness of breath. These symptoms have been persistent for the past two days. On further enquiry  it is revealed the onset of symptoms started suddenly following her husband's funeral rites.   Past Medical History:  She has a past history of hypertension for ten years  for which she has been on medication (ACE inhibitors). She has no history of diabetes or any other cardiovascular disease. In the past  she has exhibited symptoms of anxiety and has been under a psychiatrist's treatment for the same. She denies any history of substance abuse.  Family History: She had a family history of heart disease - her father passed away with myocardial infarction at an age of 72  and her younger brother has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease.   Current Medications: Currently  she is on Lisinopril 10mg daily for her hypertension  and Escitalopram 10mg daily for her anxiety disorder. She mentioned that she is compliant with her medications.  Physical Examination: On examination  she appears anxious and worried. She remains tachycardic with a heart rate of 118/min  blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/95  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The heart sounds seem normal without murmur  rub  or gallop.  Based on her age  gender  stress history  hypertension  and presenting symptoms  a working diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is suspected. This diagnosis is further supported by echo-cardiogram which might show an absence of blockages in the coronary arteries  and left ventricular apical ballooning. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,8,Problem Representation:  Patient's Initials: J.C.  Age: 68  Sex: Female  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired  Marital Status: Widowed  Living Situation: Lives alone  Insurance: Medicare  Religion: Catholic  Chief Complaint: Severe chest pain and shortness of breath  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension 2. Hyperlipidemia 3. Anxiety disorder 4. Depression 5. Pre-existing asthma 6. Non-smoker 7. Moderate alcohol use 8. No known drug allergies  Family History: 1. Father deceased - coronary artery disease 2. Mother deceased - stroke 3. One sister with hypertension 4. No family history of cancer  Social History: 1. Widow for 5 years  which was a significant emotional trauma for her.  2. She lives alone and her main social engagement is through her church. 3. She is financially stable. 4. She does not smoke. 5. She drinks wine moderately (1-2 glasses per day). 6. She used to work as a school teacher.  Recent Life Events: 1. She recently lost her job due to downsizing  which has significantly increased her stress and anxiety levels. 2. She also reports that her eldest son is going through a divorce and she has been bearing their emotional burden.  Exposures: No significant exposures documented  This patient's presentation is representative for a typical case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as 'broken heart syndrome')  a condition often triggered by severe stress or loss. The disease mainly affects post-menopausal women and is often preceded by a significant emotional or physical stressor. Her age  gender  experienced stress  and symptoms such as chest pain and breathlessness  align with common features of this syndrome. Her hypertension could be a contributing risk factor. Her family history indicates an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease. Her mental health conditions (anxiety and depression) align with the emotional stress component often seen in patients with this condition.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,9,Patient Profile:  - Name: Jane Doe - Age: 68 years  - Gender: Female  - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired teacher - Marital status: Widowed  Presenting Complaint: Chest pain  Shortness of breath   Medical History: Jane was previously diagnosed with hypertension  and has been managing it with a combination diet and medication regimen. She also has a history of anxiety  for which she takes regular medication. Jane has a moderate exercise regimen as recommended by physicians.  Family History: Both her parents had a history of cardiac diseases. Her mother had a myocardial infarction at the age of 72  which is significant. Her father also had coronary artery disease.   Habits: She has never smoked and drinks alcohol only occasionally. She does not use drugs  and has no known allergies.  Pertinent Info: Jane's husband recently passed away after a long battle with cancer  resulting in high emotional stress.   Representing Problem: This patient presents with chest pain and shortness of breath  symptoms that may be consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken-heart syndrome). Given her recent severe psychological stress  her age  and gender (takotsubo more commonly affects postmenopausal women)  this diagnosis becomes a primary consideration. Her history of hypertension may also increase her susceptibility to takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Therefore  Jane's symptoms  demographics  and recent severe stress event combined suggest a high index of suspicion for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She requires immediate evaluation through ECG and cardiac imaging tests to confirm or rule out this condition.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,10,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  A 68-year-old postmenopausal woman  retired teacher  living with her 70-year-old husband in an urban setting  identified as Caucasian  non-smoker and rarely drinks alcohol.   Presenting complaint:  The patient reports experiencing acute chest pain and difficulty in breathing  following an emotionally distressing argument with her son. No prior episode of a similar condition. SPIKES was used to inform her that her son was recently diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer.   Medical History:  The patient was previously diagnosed with hypertension for 20 years and is regularly taking prescribed medications (Anti-hypertensives: Lisinopril  Hydrochlorothiazide). She also has a history of hypercholesterolemia controlled with diet and Atorvastatin  and mild osteoporosis (taking calcium and vitamin D supplements). She doesn't have a history of coronary artery disease  and no family history of heart diseases or stroke was reported.   Psychosocial history reveals a lack of regular physical activity and increased psychological stress due to her son’s recent cancer diagnosis. The patient also reveals a past period of major depressive disorder in her 50s  following the death of her mother  but no longer in treatment or on medication for this. She reports good adherence to her prescribed medication and diet.  Physical Examination:  Vital signs are: blood pressure 160/90 mmHg  heart rate 90 beats/min  respiratory rate 24 breaths/min  temperature 37.0 °C (98.6 °F)  and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Her BMI is 27.2. Physical examination is remarkable for increased jugular venous pressure  and mild peripheral edema in the lower extremities. No murmurs or extra heart sounds. Drastic pain increase on palpation of the left chest wall and tenderness elicited.   Tentative Diagnosis:  Given the acute onset of chest pain  visibly elevated stress levels  and her known high blood pressure  acute takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome)  precipitated by profound emotional stress  is strongly suspected.  The above representation is based on typical demographic and clinical characteristics of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The condition is most common in postmenopausal women  and often precipitated by acute emotional stress. Although the exact pathogenesis is unknown  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and psychosocial factors such as chronic stress and depression are recognized contributing factors.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,11,Problem Representation:  Ms. Barbara Jackson  a 67-year-old Caucasian female  has presented with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome  including severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started suddenly without any apparent triggers.   She is postmenopausal and her medical history is significant for hypertension  which has been treated with a calcium channel blocker and a thiazide diuretic for the past 10 years. Despite being overweight  her lipid profile is normal and she does not have diabetes.   Moreover  she is a never-smoker and she does not consume alcohol. She lives alone since her husband passed away 2 years back and she has been on chronic medication for depression and generalized anxiety disorder.   Her stress levels have been high for the past few months due to financial hardships.   Her mother suffered from myocardial infarction at the age of 75. Otherwise  there is no significant family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Differential diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome due to plaque rupture  acute myocarditis  aortic dissection  or pulmonary embolism. However  the possibility of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (or broken-heart syndrome) could be high given her sex  age  menopausal status  psychological stress  and the sudden onset of symptoms. She is immediately admitted to the cardiac care unit for close monitoring and further investigation and management.   By way of stress tests  cardiac biomarkers  and cardiac imaging we can determine if this is indeed a case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography or left ventriculography may show the typical apical ballooning characteristic of the condition  wherein the apex of the left ventricle dilates in systole while the base of the heart contracts normally. Moreover  coronary angiography would typically show no significant occlusive disease which is consistent with the presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,12,Patient Profile   Name: Maria Lopez Age: 72 years Sex: Female Ethnicity: Hispanic Residential Area: Urban Occupation: Retired School Teacher  Presenting complaint:  Mrs. Lopez presents with acute chest pain and shortness of breath  which she rates as a severe discomfort on a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the most severe pain patient has ever experienced). Her symptoms started about 2 hours ago and she reports feeling faint but has not lost consciousness.   Past medical history:  Mrs. Lopez has no history of coronary heart disease and her blood cholesterol and blood pressure levels are within normal range owing to lifestyle changes and frequent monitoring. She has Type II diabetes  and she is on oral hypoglycemic agents. Besides this  she reports prior episodes of anxiety and has a history of thyroid issues.  Social history:  Ever since she retired about 7 years ago  she’s been living alone. She reports she's widowed and has cumulative stress due to bereavement  loneliness and a recent robbery incidence in her neighborhood.  Health-related behaviors:  Mrs. Lopez is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She leads an active lifestyle and enjoys walking her dog and gardening. She follows a balanced diet as advised by her nutritionist due to her diabetes.  Literature Reference:  Consistent with literature  takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or broken heart syndrome  is most commonly seen in postmenopausal women with a mean age of 62-75 years. It is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stressors. Symptoms mimic those of a heart attack and can include chest pain and shortness of breath. It is also reported that individuals with a history of neurological disorder and those with a psychiatric disorder have a higher chance of developing takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,13,Patient Profile: A 67-year-old  post-menopausal  widowed Caucasian female presents with takotsubo cardiomyopathy symptoms.  Presenting Problem: She experiences chest pain  shortness of breath  and fatigue. The symptoms started suddenly after she received news of a loved one's death - an emotionally stressful event.  Demographic Characterization: Statistically  takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more prevalent in females above 50 years old  precisely around the post-menopause age. It is often associated with acute emotional or physical stress and is frequently seen in women who have faced a recent significant life trauma like the loss of a spouse or a loved post-menopausal woman.  Past Medical History: She has a history of hypertension managed with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. She also has a record of major depressive disorder due to significant life events  treated with antidepressants. She presents with Hyperlipidemia and is undergoing statin therapy. No history of smoking  alcohol  or drug abuse is reported.  She has been living alone since her husband's death five years ago and has infrequent social interactions. She has a past history of recurrent urinary tract infections treated with antibiotics. She also presents with osteoporosis  for which she is taking calcium and vitamin D supplements. She has hypothyroidism that is well-managed with levothyroxine.   Review of Systems: The patient reports feeling 'exhausted ' and 'on edge' most of the time since her husband's passing away. Sleep is frequently disturbed due to nightmares.   Problem Representation: A post-menopausal woman with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and depression presents with chest pain  shortness of breath  and fatigue  symptoms consistent with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The onset of symptoms followed sudden  emotional stress. A comprehensive medical management plan would be needed  taking into account her pre-existing medical conditions and concurrent depressive symptoms.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,14,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian woman presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath.  Demographics: The majority of patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy are postmenopausal women. Studies show that about 90% of reported cases are in women aged 58 to 75 years. Caucasians represent a significant portion of patients  although the condition affects people across races.  Past Medical History: 1. Significant emotional stress – The patient reports a recent major life event  such as the death of a loved one or a car accident  known to trigger takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 2. History of a neurological disorder – The patient has previously been diagnosed with a neurological disorder such as epilepsy or a head injury. 3. Previous psychiatric disorder – The patient has had a depressive or anxiety disorder in the past which could potentially heighten susceptibility to stress cardiomyopathy. 4. Previous signs of heart disease – Patient denies previous heart attacks (myocardial infarctions)  but has experienced some symptoms of heart problems like chest pain  heart palpitations  or fatigue. 5. History of asthma – The patient has a longstanding diagnosis of asthma  receiving inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilator treatment. 6. Hormone replacement therapy – The patient is not currently on hormone replacement therapy.   Current Symptoms: 1. Chest pain – The patient describes severe chest pain that resembles the pain experienced during a heart attack. 2. Shortness of Breath – The patient is visibly struggling to breathe and finds normal activities challenging. 3. Periodic fainting or near fainting – The patient reports fainting episodes over the past few weeks. 4. Late-onset asthma – The patient has been experiencing sudden  severe asthma attacks.  Thus  the patient's profile  along with her history of neurological disorder  asthma  psychological disorders  and the absence of hormone replacement therapy fits within the typical profile of a patient with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The recent emotional stress and presenting symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath create a strong indication for this potential diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,15,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 68-year-old postmenopausal woman  living alone with a high stress lifestyle due to financial instability and the recent death of her husband. She is of Asian descent with a body mass index (BMI) of 23.   Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and nausea. She indicates that these symptoms started suddenly a few hours after she heard the news of her husband's death.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  for which she is taking medication. She also has a family history of cardiovascular diseases. There are no known allergies. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her diet consists mainly of fish and vegetables. There is no history of diabetes or other chronic diseases.   Lifestyle & Psychosocial Factors: The patient leads a stressful lifestyle. She was the primary caregiver for her husband during his prolonged illness  and endured financial strain due to medical and funeral expenses. She is living alone with minimal social support. The stress has escalated after the death of her husband.  Current Medications: She has been on antihypertensive medication (lisinopril) for the past 7 years.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  the patient appears in distress. Vital signs: BP: 168/98 mmHg  Pulse: 120 bpm  Respiratory rate: 22 bpm  Temperature: 97.8 F. Cardiovascular exam reveals tachycardia with a regular rhythm.   Based on these presenting symptoms  high level of stress  and past medical history  there is a high suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Relevant Statistics from Literature: - Most common in postmenopausal women (around 90% of cases).  - High correlation with a preceding stressful event (including physical and emotional stressors).  - Ethnically  it is seen more commonly among Asians.  - Risk factors include hypertension  psychological stress  and a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. - It is often mistaken for an acute coronary syndrome because of similar initial symptoms and EKG changes. - The actual cause of takotsubo cardiomyopathy remains unknown  but one theory suggests that a surge of stress hormones stuns the heart  leading to temporary heart muscle failure. - A diagnostic hallmark is the presence of """"apical ballooning"""" - a deformation of the left ventricular apex visible on imaging studies."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,16,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Sex: Female - Age: 68 years old - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Recently Retired - Social History: Lives alone with high level of stress due to recent loss of spouse  non-smoker  occasional alcohol drinker  Medical History: - She was diagnosed with hypertension ten years ago that is currently well controlled with medication - Had a history of hypercholesterolemia - Completed menopause at 50  underwent hormone replacement therapy - Non-diabetic - No previous history of heart disease or stroke - No family history of heart disease - No known drug allergies  Current Presentation: The patient reports experiencing severe chest pains that came on suddenly after she found out about a close relative's death. The chest pain was associated with shortness of breath  palpitations  sweating and nausea. Upon her arrival at the hospital  an electrocardiogram revealed abnormalities in her heart rhythm and blood tests showed elevated cardiac biomarkers  both suggestive of a heart attack. However  a subsequent angiogram showed no significant coronary artery disease that could explain these findings. A subsequent echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle  a characteristic feature of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  In summary  this patient is a 68-year-old recently retired  Caucasian woman  living with high stress levels due to recent loss of spouse  experiencing an episode of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as 'broken heart syndrome'). She has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia that are well managed with medications.   Literature Sources: - Templin  C.  Ghadri  J. R.  Diekmann  J. et al. (2015).

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,17,"Patient Representation:  Patient A is a 71-year-old Caucasian female who presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  similar to what she described as a """"heart attack"""". She reports being under significant emotional stress recently due to the sudden death of her husband.  She has a past medical history of controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia and she has been a non-smoker for the last 15 years. She reports occasional alcohol consumption but denies any illicit drug use. She follows a balanced diet and engages in mild-to-moderate physical activity.  Her symptoms started approximately 8 hours ago. She described them as an abrupt intense chest pain radiating towards her left shoulder  associated with shortness of breath  palpitations  and feeling faint. She has no history of similar symptoms in the past.   On physical examination  her blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/90 mmHg  with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute  and regular rhythm.  Based on her symptoms  history  and physical examination  takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""") is highly suspected.   It is worth mentioning that her presentation aligns with epidemiological studies in the literature which suggest that takotsubo cardiomyopathy predominantly affects postmenopausal women  often in the setting of severe emotional or physical stress. There is also emerging evidence of a possible link with histories of anxiety and depression. Importantly  her age and gender are consistent with the average age of presentaion for takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is typically between 58 and 75 years  and predominantly in women."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,18,Patient Profile:  Patient: Ms. X Age: 67 years old Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Recently retired school teacher Living Situation: Lives alone Location: Urban location Family History: No known hereditary diseases Habits: Non-smoker and occasional drinker  Presenting Complaints: Ms. X arrived at the emergency room with acute onset chest pain radiating to left arm and shortness of breath following an intense argument with her neighbor.   Medical History: 1. Hypertension: Diagnosed 5 years ago  on medication (Beta Blockers) 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 3 years ago  on medication 3. Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed 2 years ago  on medication 4. History of severe stress conditions: Recently lost her job due to downsizing  and is undergoing a divorce process.  Social History: Ms. X is a recently retired school teacher has been facing stressful personal situations. She lives alone  is a non-smoker  and drinks alcohol socially. She follows a moderate exercise regime.  Recent Major Event: A stressful event happened the day she fell ill  where she had an emotional argument with a neighbor.  Physical Examination: On arrival  she is conscious  oriented but anxious; shows pallor. The pulse rate is 110 per minute  blood pressure is 160/100 mm of Hg.  Based on her symptoms  medical history  and recent emotional stress  a tentative diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is suspected.  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  occurs most often in postmenopausal women. The presentation is often similar to a heart attack  with acute chest pain  shortness of breath or fainting. This condition is typically triggered by severe stress and emotional trauma.  Note: Though literature shows higher prevalence in Asian population  cases are reported globally across races. This profile assumes Caucasian ethnicity based on location.  Plan for Management: The patient is immediately referred for an Electrocardiogram (ECG)  cardiac enzymes  chest X-ray and Echocardiogram to establish the diagnosis. Management involves supportive therapy which includes heart medications to reduce the workload of the heart  and therapy to manage stress and anxiety.  Additional Recommendations: A comprehensive review of her current medications given her existing comorbidities. Also some additional routine tests recommended regularly to monitor her diabetes and hypertension.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,19,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  residing in the United States of America.   Presenting Complaints: The patient reports acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath  along with generalized weakness for the last few hours. The symptoms started suddenly while she is under significant emotional stress due to the recent death of her husband.  Past Medical History: She has a history of well-controlled hypertension for 10 years. Additionally  she reports a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and suffers from significant anxiety and depression. She is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She does consume moderate levels of caffeine daily.   Family History: There is no significant cardiac history in her family.  Social History: She lives alone and her only son lives in another state. She has recently retired from her job as a school teacher.  Current Medications: She is taking Enalapril 10mg daily for hypertension and Omeprazole 20mg for GERD. She also takes a daily multivitamin and Omega-3 supplements.   Relevance to Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: The demographic and clinical features presented here – the patient's age  sex  presence of emotional stress  and symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea – correlate with the typical presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as Stress Cardiomyopathy or Broken Heart Syndrome)  a condition often precipitated by intense emotional or physical stress leading to severe  but often reversible  left ventricular dysfunction.   Literature indicates that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is more common in post-menopausal women and can often be mistaken for a heart attack. Hypertension is a common comorbidity found in many patients. Psychological stressors  such as grief  can trigger a surge of stress hormones that temporarily """"stun"""" the heart  causing symptoms similar to those of a heart attack."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,20,"Patient Problem Representation:  Patient Identification: Ms. Harper  68 years old  Asian female   Chief Complaint: Presenting with acute chest pain and shortness of breath  History of Present Illness: Ms. Harper describes sudden onset of severe chest pain at rest  associated with palpitations and breathlessness  symptoms that she has never experienced before. The precipitating event could be the sudden death of her brother 2 days ago.   Past Medical History: Significant for hypertension controlled on medication  no known history of ischemic heart disease  not diabetic  non-smoker and she leads a sedentary lifestyle post-retirement.  Social History: She's a widow who lives alone  recently retired from her job as a school teacher. Her brother was her only immediate family.  Medication Background: Only takes antihypertensive medication - Lisinopril 10mg daily  Review of Symptoms: No recent history of fever  cough  weight loss. No complaints of pain other than the current chest pain.   Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  pulse rate of 105 bpm. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads.  Background and Rationale:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) or """"broken heart syndrome"""" predominantly affects postmenopausal women (approx. 90%) with a mean age of 58-75 years old  and is often precipitated by a stressful event. Ms. Harper fits the typical demographic and her sudden loss can be a significant emotional trigger. Her hypertension is also a common comorbidity in TCM. The current presentation with severe chest pain  associated symptoms and ECG changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia raises an immediate suspicion of TCM  although acute coronary syndrome is a key differential diagnosis. Further examination  particularly echocardiography and cardiac biomarker studies  will be required to confirm the diagnosis."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,21,Problem Representation:  Chief Complaint: The patient complains of sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the left arm and shortness of breath.  Demographics: The patient is a 65-year-old Asian female.  Family History: There is a history of heart disease in the family  with her father having passed away from a heart attack  and an elder sister currently living with coronary artery disease.   Personal History: The patient is a non-smoker and moderate alcohol consumer. She follows a balanced diet and engages in mild physical activity.  Social History: The patient is a widowed retiree who lives alone. She has four children  with the youngest recently moving out. She had a career as a school teacher. It has been a stressful period for her because of her daughter’s recent divorce and the grief over losing her husband last year.  Clinical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are currently treated with medication. She recently visited the emergency department 3 months ago due to an isolated panic attack.  Current Medication: The patient is on antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril 20mg once daily) and Statin (Atorvastatin 10mg once daily) for controlling lipid levels. She is not on any specific medication for anxiety or stress management.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient is in acute distress. Vitals include: Blood pressure: 155/95 mmHg  Heart rate: 110 beats per minute  Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute  Temperature: 98.6° F  Oxygen saturation: 94% on room air.  Investigations: ECG shows ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Cardio markers show slight elevation in troponin level. Chest X-ray was normal. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated apical ballooning and basal hypercontractility indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis: Based on clinical presentation and investigations  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is made.  Note: The demographic characteristics and presentation align with what is typically observed in Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy patients  who are predominantly post-menopausal women  often precipitated by a stressful event.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,22,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Gender: Female  Age: 65-70 years  Demographics: Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired  Marital Status: Widowed   Presenting Problem:  The patient reports experiencing severe chest pain and shortness of breath. Additionally  the patient recently endured emotional stress following the death of her husband.  Past Medical History:  According to her records  she has a history of hypertension and is a nonsmoker. She does not have any history of coronary artery disease or diabetes. The patient reportedly has no history of substance abuse. Her medications include only antihypertensive drugs. The patient does not have any known allergies to medications.   Family History: The patient’s family history reveals her mother had rheumatoid arthritis and her father had melanoma. There is no family history of heart diseases.  Lifestyle Factors: The patient lives alone after her husband's passing and has limited social interaction. She does not exercise regularly and her diet is said to be high in sodium. Her alcohol intake is described as socially moderate.  Given this demographic representation  medical history  and current presentation  takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a possible diagnosis. Also known as broken-heart syndrome  it tends to occur in postmenopausal women and is often triggered by severe emotional stress. In this syndrome  the heart's main pumping chamber  the left ventricle  enlarges and doesn't pump blood effectively  which may lead to severe heart muscle failure. However  it is usually a temporary condition that's treatable.   Next steps: Clinical confirmation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy will require further diagnostic measures  starting with ECG  echocardiogram  and possibly a blood test for cardiac biomarkers. The patient would also benefit from a referral to a cardiologist for specialized treatment.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,23,"Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics:   - Female - Age: 68-years-old - Single  - Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting Problem:  - Complaints of subjective episodes of shortness of breath with exertion and intermittent atypical chest pain - 4/10 chest pain typically following periods of intense emotional distress.  - No radiation of chest pain  - Reports feeling restless and anxious during chest pain episodes - No history of chest pain on exertion - Crushing nature of chest pain  which may sometimes accompany nausea  vomiting - Denies associated dizziness  palpitations  Past Medical History:   - History of anxiety and depression - Reported severe emotional trauma 1 week prior to the onset of symptoms - No past surgical history - Not known for hypertension or other cardiovascular diseases - No known history of asthma or other respiratory diseases - No known previous history of myocardial infarction or angina - No known history of stroke - Doesn't smoke  drink alcohol or use illicit drugs  Physical Examination:  - The patient is afebrile  with a blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg  a heart rate of 90 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 per minute  and oxygen saturation of 96% while breathing room air. - Heart: Rhythm regular. No murmurs  rubs  or gallops. - Lungs: Clear to auscultation - Peripheral pulses intact in all extremities   This is the typical profile of a patient who might be diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken-heart syndrome"""". 90% patients are post-menopausal women. The disorder usually follows a period of severe emotional stress. Despite common presenting symptoms that may mimic myocardial infarction  e.g.  chest pain or shortness of breath  these patients generally do not have coronary artery disease. Patients' outcome and prognosis are good with treatment usually aimed at reducing sympathetic psychological stress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,24,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 67 years - Gender: Female - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Recently retired schoolteacher  Presenting Complaints: - Severe chest pain - Shortness of breath - Palpitations - Nausea - Lightheadedness  Demographic Characteristics: Research indicates that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome  typically affects post-menopausal women around the age of 67. Caucasians are more frequently affected than other ethnicities.   Past Medical History: - Recurrent major depressive disorder  managed with psychotherapy and pharmacological treatment - Generalized anxiety disorder - History of hypertension  managed with medication (lisinopril) - No prior known heart diseases - Non-smoker - Moderate alcohol consumer  Recent Life Events: - Recent intense emotional stress due to the sudden death of a close friend  - Patient is also coping with retirement after decades of work  Family History: - Mother had coronary heart disease - Father had type 2 diabetes  Medications: - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for depression - Benzodiazepine as needed for anxiety - Lisinopril for hypertension  The overall patient profile suggests a high clinical suspicion for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The combination of physical symptomatology  past medical history of depression and anxiety  recent emotional stress  and demographic predisposition (post-menopausal  female) converge on this diagnosis. This condition often mimics heart attack symptoms but is a form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy where part of the heart temporarily enlarges and does not pump well  often due to severe emotional stress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,25,Patient's Profile:  Ms. Catherine is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who presents with acute chest pain radiating to the left arm. She has a 10-year history of hypertension and is currently on oral antihypertensive medications. She also has a history of hyperlipidemia. She is a retired nurse and a widow who lost her husband a year ago. Over the past six months  she has experienced a deep sense of loss and depression. She used to smoke in her younger years  but she quit 20 years ago. She maintains a mostly sedentary lifestyle following her retirement.  Problem Representation:  Ms. Catherine's symptoms have developed rapidly over the last few hours  with a severe squeezing and heaviness in her chest that radiates to her left arm. The chest pain is associated with shortness of breath  weakness  lightheadedness  and sweats. She notes that this is the first time she has experienced such a severe pain  describing it as quite different from any previous anginal pain  which have been well controlled with her medication until now. There has been no cough  fever  palpitations  or gastrointestinal symptoms.  Her medication regimen includes amlodipine and rosuvastatin. There is no known drug allergy. She lives alone since her husband passed away and noted increased stress and emotional turmoil regarding her bereavement. She has a daughter who lives in a different state and has been providing emotional support through frequent phone conversations.  She denies any illicit drug use but admits to occasional alcohol consumption. There is no previous history of any mental health disorder or usage of psychotropic medications.  Her increased stress levels  hypertension  and the sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the arm suggest acute coronary syndrome. However  her age  gender and recent significant emotional stress also make takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken-heart syndrome) a likely differential diagnosis to consider. Further diagnostic evaluation with electrocardiogram  cardiac enzymes  and echocardiography would help to clarify the diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,26,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information:   The patient is a 68-year-old  postmenopausal female with Caucasian ethnicity. She lives in an urban location with her husband and has an upper-middle-class socio-economic status.  Presenting Issue:  The patient has presented with intense chest pain and shortness of breath. Initially  these symptoms mimicked those of a heart attack and occurred following a major emotional stress like sudden and unexpected death of a close family member making her extremely distressed and anxious.  Relevant Past Medical History:  The patient has a significant past medical history of hypertension  which she has been managing with medication for the last 15 years. She also has a history of anxiety and had been undergoing treatment for the same. She reports sporadic episodes of heavy alcohol consumption and has no history of drug abuse. She also previous family history of any heart disease. Her body mass index (BMI) calculates to 27  indicating she is overweight. Furthermore  she has lived a sedentary lifestyle  with minimal exercise.  Physical Examination and Lab Results:  Her physical examination showed no significant findings apart from tachycardia. Her laboratory results revealed slightly raised levels of St-segment elevation. An echocardiogram showed systolic apical ballooning and basal hyper-contractility  which are consistent with stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy. Her coronary angiogram was normal and ruled out acute coronary syndrome.  This case scenario is typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as Broken heart syndrome) demographic  which according to literature  most commonly affects postmenopausal women  and is often triggered by severe emotional stress. Individuals with this condition often present with symptoms similar to that of a heart attack. The disease  however  is typically reversible and has a good prognosis with appropriate treatment and stress management.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,27,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 60-75 years old - Gender: Female (90% of cases are female) - Ethnicity: Any  but higher incidence in Caucasian and Asian populations - Socioeconomic Status: Middle to upper middle class - Occupation: Retired or working in high-stress job fields  Presenting Complaints: - Acute onset chest pain - Shortness of breath - Palpitations - Nausea and/or vomiting - Feeling of impending doom  Past Medical History: - Pre-menopausal - History of recent severe emotional or physical stressors (e.g.  death of a loved one  significant financial difficulty  major surgical procedure) - No prior history of heart disease  Personal history: - Non-smoker - Occasional alcohol consumption - Regular physical activity  Relevant Physiologic History: - No history of significant weight change - Normal BMI  Family History: - No significant cardiac disease in the family - Some family history of autoimmune diseases  Social History: - Lives alone or with partner - Loss of a spouse or a close family member recently - No use of recreational drugs  Review of systems: - No symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease  such as angina - No symptom suggestive of autoimmune diseases  This representation is generalized and designed to depict a typical patient presenting with takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""". Variations between individual patients can and do occur."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,28,Patient Profile:   Name: Ms. Mary Thompson  Age: 68 years old  Gender: Female  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired teacher  Residential Status: Lives alone  recently widowed   Presenting Problem:   Ms. Thompson presented to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain radiating to the left arm. She complains of trouble breathing and sweating. She reveals feeling ever-increasing levels of stress and emotional turmoil following her husband's recent death.   Past Medical History:  - She has no known medical history of heart disease. - She suffers from mild hypertension  controlled with medication. - Former smoker  quit over 10 years ago. - Occasional alcohol consumption. - Menopausal at the age of 54.  Physical Examination:   Initial evaluation shows moderate distress due to pain and anxiety.  Blood pressure: 150/85 mmHg  Height: 5ft 6in  Weight: 160 lbs   Recent Biopsychosocial History:   Ms. Thompson reports elevated levels of emotional stress following the recent demise of her spouse. She has reduced interactions with friends and family and also mentions disturbed sleep patterns and reduced appetite. She also mentions having experienced several panic attacks in the past few weeks.  Clinical Impression:   Sudden onset of symptoms  marked emotional stress  history of hypertension  and advanced age makes Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) a diagnostic possibility  although the final conclusion must be based on further testing and examinations.   A recent research found that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is more common in postmenopausal women aged over 50 years old  and a majority of the cases tend to follow a physical or emotional stress trigger. Therefore  based on these parameters  this problem representation fits the typical demographic for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,29,"Demographic Characterization:  Patient Gender: Female Age: 68 Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  former nurse Psychosocial History: Recently widowed  reports frequent anxiety and stress  Relevant Past Medical History:  - Diagnosed with hypertension 7 years ago  managed with medication. - History of anxiety disorder diagnosed 10 years ago; treated with psychotherapy and occasional use of benzodiazepines. - No history of coronary artery disease. - Non-smoker  moderate alcohol use. - Regular physical activity. - No family history of cardiomyopathy.  Problem Representation:  This is a 68-year-old recently widowed Caucasian female with a history of hypertension and anxiety disorder who presents with a sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. The presentation coincides with a period of heightened emotional stress following her spouse’s death. On resistant hypertension therapy and sporadic use of benzodiazepines for anxiety. She has no significant past medical history of coronary artery disease  and yet her initial cardiac biomarkers and EKG findings are indicative of an acute myocardial injury. Her echocardiogram reveals left ventricular apical ballooning and dysfunction  lacking evidence of obstructive coronary disease  classic for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""") are most frequently seen in postmenopausal women and it has been associated with preceding psychological or physical stressors. The clinical presentation often mimics acute coronary syndrome  but it is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction  often with regional wall motion abnormalities that extend beyond a single coronary perfusion territory  and they do not have angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease  as is marked in this elderly female patient."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,30,"Patient Problem Representation:  Mrs. K  a 67-year-old postmenopausal woman  presents with sudden-onset chest pain  similar to that of a heart attack. The pain started unexpectedly a couple of hours ago during a heated argument with her neighbor. Since the onset of pain  she also noticed mild dyspnea. She denies syncope  but reports feeling lightheaded. She has no known chronic or acute medical illnesses  is not a smoker  and does not consume alcohol. Her medications only include occasional over-the-counter analgesics for mild joint pain. Family history reveals no significant heart disease.  On examination  her holosystolic murmur at the apex is suggestive of a mitral regurgitation murmur  she has no pedal edema and her jugular venous pulse is not elevated. Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads and lab tests showed slightly elevated troponins. Echocardiogram reveals a dyskinetic apex with hyperkinesis of the basal walls  yielding the classic """"tako-tsubo""""  or “stress cardiomyopathy” appearance—also known as “broken-heart syndrome.""""  She appears anxious and frequently mentions the stressor (an argument with her neighbor) which precipitated this set of symptoms. Notably  she indicates a lifestyle characterized by a high level of stress. She is a widow and lives alone  which potentially accentuates her stress levels. She does not report any history of anxiety or depression  but indicate several recent stressful life events.  This profile is consistent with the majority of cases described in literature for takotsubo cardiomyopathy; it primarily affects postmenopausal women and is often precipitated by emotional or physical stress. Furthermore  her presentation with chest pain  ECG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes mimicking a heart attack is also characteristic of this syndrome. The absence of significant coronary artery disease will be confirmed with a coronary angiogram."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,31,Patient Profile:  Patient Name: Mrs. Jane Doe Age: 71 years Gender: Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Residential status: Living alone Occupation: Retired school teacher Education: College graduate  Presenting complaint: Mrs. Doe was brought to the emergency department having experienced sudden and severe chest pain  similar to what she imagines a heart attack would feel like.  Past Medical History:  - Treated for depression 10 years ago - No history of traditional heart disease risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes or hyperlipidemia - Recently experienced the death of her spouse - Underwent a hip replacement surgery 4 years back - No known allergies  Family History:  - Father died due to stroke at the age of 77 - Mother suffered from hypertension and passed away at age 86  Social History:  - Light alcohol consumption (One glass of wine during dinner) - Non-smoker - Limited physical activity due to hip problems - Lives alone  recently widowed  Literature suggests that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy  affect primarily postmenopausal women. The condition is often precipitated by a stressful event  both emotional (e.g.  grief  surprise  anger  relationship conflicts) or physical (e.g.  acute illness  surgery). Studies have linked it with neurological or psychiatric disorders. It should be distinguished clinically from acute myocardial infarction because of its different management and prognosis. It presents with symptoms similar to a heart attack  but without the evidence of any blockages in the coronary arteries  which is typical for heart attacks. Given her age  sex  triggering stressful event (recent death of her spouse)  absence of classic heart risk factors  and presenting symptoms  Mrs. Doe fits the typical patient profile of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,32,Problem representation:  Patient Information: A 68-year old postmenopausal Caucasian woman presenting with chest pain and breathlessness.  Chief Complaint: Acute on-set chest pain radiating to the left arm with associated shortness of breath.  Background History: The patient has experienced chronic stress due to her roles as caretaker for a spouse with dementia. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She follows a balanced diet. Her BMI is 26. She has a family history of hypertension but no immediate family history of heart disease.  Relevant Past Medical History: 1. Mild hypertension managed with diet and lifestyle modifications. 2. History of depression  currently managed with SSRIs.  Findings from Physical Examination:  On examination  she appears anxious  experiencing moderate distress from chest pain. Heart rate is elevated at 105 beats per minute  blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg  respiratory rate at 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.  Justification: This representation was chosen because Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome often occurs in postmenopausal women (over 90% of reported cases) and is usually triggered by severe emotional stress  both of which match the profile of this patient. The condition mimics the symptoms of myocardial infarction  including chest pain  shortness of breath  and findings on examination. Depression  necessary long-term care for family members  and postmenopausal status are risk factors for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Additionally  the patient's apparent anxiety  elevated heart rate  and elevated blood pressure are consistent with a stress-induced cardiac event. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,33,"Patient Profile:  Demographic Information:  Patient is a 64-year-old  postmenopausal Asian female  occasional drinker  and a non-smoker.  Past Medical History:  The patient in question has a history of hypertension  which has been under control with medication. She additionally suffers from chronic anxiety.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient presents with sudden and severe chest pain  palpitations  and shortness of breath which started a few hours ago. The symptoms are similar to those experienced during a heart attack.  Social History:  The patient is a widow and she lives alone. She retired 4 years ago but is still active and regularly does volunteer work. She reports experiencing a significantly stressful event recently - the sudden death of her only son.  Family History:  Her mother suffered from a heart attack at the age of 68  while her father had a stroke at 70.  Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  the patient appears anxious  with elevated blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg and an irregular heart rate of 102 beats per minute. The lung fields are clear on auscultation. No peripheral edema is noted.  Relevant Diagnostic Tests:  A 12-lead ECG points towards ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  suggestive of an acute anterior myocardial infarction. However  subsequent coronary angiography does not confirm any evidence of significant coronary artery disease  which would be expected in typical myocardial infarction. Left ventriculography  on the other hand  indicates apical ballooning with hyperkinesia of the basal segments  a pattern that fits with the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Subsequent serum blood tests reveal an elevation of cardiac enzymes (troponin T and creatine kinase-MB)  indicative of heart muscle injury. Thyroid and other functions are within normal limits.  Considering all the details  this problem representation points to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often known as """"broken-heart syndrome """" largely prevalent in postmenopausal women and often triggered by severe emotional stress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,34,"Patient Profile Description:  1. Patient: """"Sarah"""". 2. Age: 67 years old. 3. Sex: Female. 4. Race: Caucasian. 5. Occupation: Recently retired teacher. 6. Marital Status: Widowed recently. 7. Insurance Status: Medicare.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension  managed with medication.  2. History of severe anxiety and depression. She has been receiving treatment and taking anti-depressants.  3. No history of smoking or substance abuse.  Recent Events:  Sarah lost her husband of several years to cancer very recently  which has been an emotionally traumatic event for her  increasing her stress and anxiety greatly.  Presenting Symptoms:  1. Sarah reports experiencing intense episodes of 'heartache' and chest pain. 2. She has also complained of shortness of breath  lightheadedness and nausea.  Representative Problem:  Sarah could be suffering from Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition which tends to largely affect postmenopausal women and is often triggered by severe emotional stress.   Context:  The loss of her husband is a high stress situation  which may have triggered the development of the syndrome. Sarah is Caucasian  which is also significant as while Takotsubo cardiomyopathy affects people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds  some studies suggest it may be slightly more common in Caucasians. Her pre-existing conditions (hypertension  anxiety  and depression) pose an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders  including Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,35,Representative Patient Profile:  Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female.   Demographic Information: She is recently widowed and lives alone in her suburban home. She has two adult children and three grandchildren. She recently retired from her job as a school teacher.   Cultural Background: The patient is of Western European descent. She speaks English as her native language. She is a devout Christian and attends church services every Sunday.  Socioeconomic Background: The patient is middle-class  with a comfortable retirement funding. She has Medicare and supplementary private health insurance.  Medical History:  She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia which are adequately controlled with medication. She does not have diabetes or any pre-existing heart conditions. She exercises regularly and keeps a balanced  health-conscious diet. She does not have any known allergies. However  she has experienced several episodes of major depression in the past and is currently taking antidepressants for the same.   Presentation: She has recently visited the emergency department with severe chest pain. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed changes suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome  although her angiogram reported no significant coronary artery disease. The echocardiogram  however  demonstrated apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesia  consistent with the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Precipitating Factors: The patient experienced a severe emotional stressor 3 weeks ago - the sudden death of her husband from a stroke. She has been struggling with grief and depression since then  which has significantly affected her health and wellbeing.   Conclusion: Based on her presentation and the acute emotional trauma she has faced  she has been diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly known as broken heart syndrome. Her current management plan includes beta blockers  ACE inhibitors  and psychological support to help her process her grief.    Note: This case represents a typical patient profile seen in cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which commonly affects postmenopausal women. Emotional stress is a known major trigger. The postmenopausal status of women and higher prevalence of stress and depression may contribute to the predominantly female demographic of this disease.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,36,"Patient Profile:  Patient: Mrs. E.W. Sex: Female Age: 68 years old Marital Status: Widowed Race: White / Caucasian  Occupation: Retired school teacher Smoking: Non-smoker Alcohol Use: Moderate (1-2 glasses of wine per week) Family History: Mother died of myocardial infarction.

Problem Representation:   """"A 68-year-old widowed Caucasian female with a past medical history of hypertension  anxiety  osteoporosis  and hyperlipidemia  currently experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath  has recently suffered a severe emotional trauma in the form of her son's death. Her symptoms and personal history are consistent with a typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'. This malady often presents clinically similar to an acute coronary syndrome  but is often triggered by severe emotional stressors rather than by atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Further diagnostic tests including an echocardiogram  EKG  and lab tests including troponin levels should be run to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any coronary artery disease.""""   In terms of demographics  this profile is consistent with typical patients of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  as this condition commonly affects post-menopausal women and is frequently precipitated by severe emotional stress. Other risk factors for this condition may include Caucasian race and the presence of anxiety disorders."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,37,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Jennifer Smith Age: 70 years old Gender: Female Race: Asian Occupation: Retired School teacher Marital Status: Widowed  Insurance: Medicare  Past Medical History:  1. Anxiety Disorder - diagnosed 8 years ago 2. Hypothyroidism - diagnosed 5 years ago  3. Smoking - Quit 10 years ago  smoked half a pack a day for 30 years 4. Alcohol - Social alcohol drinker 5. Regular medication includes thyroxine tablets and anti-anxiety medication  Presenting Issue:   Mrs. Smith has been brought to the emergency department by her son with a primary complaint of chest pain for the last few hours. As an accompanying symptom  she also has shortness of breath. The pain started suddenly while she was hearing news of the sudden demise of her younger brother. The pain was described as severe and unbearable.   Clinical Examination:   On examination  Mrs. Smith appears to be moderately distressed. Vital signs reveal a slightly rapid heart rate (96 bpm)  slightly elevated blood pressure (145/90)  and normal temperature (98.2 F). Breath sounds are clear bilaterally and there is no sign of peripheral edema. The cardiac examination shows a normal heart rhythm with no murmur.   This problem representation provides a succinct description of the patient with accurate demographic representation. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also named broken-heart syndrome  is often associated with emotional stress or distress. It is more common in post-menopausal women  and is especially prevalent in the Japanese population  represented in this case by Mrs. Smith's Asian ethnicity. Her chest pain and shortness of breath are the end outgrowth of a condition that has a clear etiological stressor  the sudden demise of her younger brother. Her pre-existing history of anxiety disorder is also a known risk and contributing factor.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,38,Patient Profile:  Name: Jane Doe Age: 68 Years Gender: Female Race: White  Occupation: Retired teacher. Socioeconomic Status: Middle class. Living Status: Living alone  but nearby her adult children and grandchildren.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension diagnosed at age 55  managed through medication and lifestyle changes. 2. Hysterectomy at age 45 due to large uterine fibroids. 3. Underwent psychotherapy for health-related anxiety after retirement five years ago.  Presenting Complaints: 1. Severe chest pain and shortness of breath after being startled by a sudden loud noise at a family gathering. 2. Mild persistent chest pain for the past week.  Physical Observations:  1. Tachycardia 2. Systolic murmur  Relevant Family History:  1. Mother and paternal grand-mother had a history of Alfieri's disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). 2. Father passed away from a stroke.  Social History:  1. Non-smoker 2. Occasional alcohol consumer (about one glass of wine per week). 3. Exercises regularly (about 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week). 4. Enjoys reading  knitting  and spending time with her grandchildren in her leisure time.  Upon evaluation  Jane meets several of the demographic characteristics typical for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy patients. They are often post-menopausal women  around 60-75 years old  who present after a significant emotional or physical stressor. Jane's chest pain began immediately after being startled (a known emotional stressor). Jane's past medical history of hypertension also aligns with most cases of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   In terms of racial distribution  Caucasian women are most commonly affected. Given her history of health-related anxiety  Jane may also be more prone to the syndrome  as Takotsubo has been related to psychiatric illnesses  including anxiety disorders  mood affective disorders  and personality disorders  etc. Finally  Jane's family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may also be relevant  as Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is sometimes mistaken for this condition due to similar presentation.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,39,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Johnson Gender: Female Age: 70 Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher Marital Status: Widowed Residence: Urban Insurance: Medicare  Presentation:  Mrs. Johnson presents to the emergency department with acute chest pain accompanied by shortness of breath  nausea  and vomiting  resembling an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).  Past Medical History:  - Chronic anxiety disorder - Hypertension for 10 years - History of heart disease in family (mother died of heart attack at 75) - No history of diabetes or other metabolic diseases - No history of alcohol or tobacco use  Recent Life Events:  - Death of spouse 3 months ago - Two victims of COVID-19 in family in recent 6 months  Demographic:  Literature shows that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more common in postmenopausal women  in the age group of 58-75 years. This matches with the patient's demographic. Caucasian women are more likely to develop this condition compared to African-American women.   Emotional stress is a significant catalyst for the onset of symptoms associated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  and Mrs. Johnson has gone through significant emotional traumas recently  including the loss of her spouse and other family members due to COVID-19. As a result  her chronic anxiety disorder may have contributed to her present symptoms.  The presence of hypertension in her medical history could also be a contributing risk factor. Though she does not have a history of smoking and alcohol use or metabolic diseases which are often associated with heart diseases  her family history of heart disease puts her at a higher risk.  Since she fits the typical demographic and has the associated risk factors  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a likely diagnosis. Further diagnostic tests such as ECG  echocardiography or cardiac MRI will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,40,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Gender: Female - Age: Mid 60s - Ethnicity: Caucasian (May vary but more prevalent in certain race/ethnic groups) - Occupation: Retired or in a stressful job involve high emotional load. - Lifestyle: Non-smoker and moderate drinker  Relevant Past Medical History: - Family history: Not significant for heart diseases including the disease in question. - Prior health issues: The patient has been previously diagnosed and managed for mild hypertension  and anxiety disorder. She was also treated for Graves' Disease. - Medications: Currently  she is on a beta-blocker (for hypertension)  SSRI (for anxiety)  and levothyroxine (for Graves' disease).  Presenting Complaints: The patient reports a recent stressful event from last week. Now  she presents with severe chest pain  similar to a heart attack  accompanied by difficulty breathing. She also complains about nausea  vomiting  and lightheadedness for the last day.  Physical Examination: Vitals: Blood Pressure is slightly elevated  heart rate is normal  and respiratory rate is slightly increased. Auscultation reveals no murmurs.  Investigations: - EKG shows ST-segment elevation. - Cardiac biomarkers show a mild increase in troponin but not as high as typically seen in an acute heart attack.  - Echocardiogram shows left ventricular apical ballooning  a characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Summary: A typical patient presenting with takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a post-menopausal woman  aged around 60-70 years  with a history of a stressful event  presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath. These symptoms  often accompanied by elevated blood pressure and heart rate  can mimic a heart attack  highlighting the importance of further testing. The diagnosis is confirmed by EKG changes and left ventricular apical ballooning on echocardiogram which distinguish it from typical acute coronary syndrome  and a context of emotional stress often precedes the manifestation.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,41,Patient Profile:  Name: Ms. Catherine Age: 67 years  Gender: Female Race: White/European descent Occupation: Retired  Presenting Complaint: Ms. Catherine presents with symptoms of acute chest pain and shortness of breath which started suddenly after she received a news of her son's accident.   Patient History: Ms. Catherine is suffering from postmenopausal symptoms and takes HRT when required. She also has a history of hypertension which is controlled with beta-blockers. She lost her husband a couple of years back and has since experienced several periods of stress and emotional trauma. She does not smoke but drinks socially. Her mother suffered from heart disease and died at the age of 74.   Examination Findings: Physical examination revealed signs of distress  with elevated blood pressure and heart rate. She showed normal breath sounds with no cardiac murmurs or rubs. She has no swelling in her legs or any other signs of heart failure.  Initial Problem Representation:  A 67-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian woman with a history of hypertension and chronic emotional stress  presents with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath after a recent severe emotional distress. Her clinical examination shows no signs of heart failure but presents distress with elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Given the demographic propensity of takotsubo cardiomyopathy amongst older postmenopausal women  her symptoms and clinical presentation  as well as the presence of a recent emotional trauma  suggest potential takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as 'broken heart syndrome'). The differential diagnosis will include other causes of acute chest pain such as myocardial infarction  or aortic dissection. All these diagnoses can be discriminated with further investigations including cardiac biomarkers  ECG  and possibly echocardiogram or coronary angiography.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,42,Problem Representation:  Patient Information:   1. Demographics: The patient is a 67-year-old post-menopausal female (as the prevalence of this condition is 5-10 times higher in postmenopausal women). She is of Asian ethnicity  specifically Japanese (where the condition was first described and has the highest reported cases).   2. Occupation: Recently retired teacher.   3. Living Situation: Lives alone but has two adult children living within a call's reach.   4. Serial Vital Signs: Reported elevated heart rate and increased blood pressure during hospital consultation.  Presenting Complaint:  She presents to the outpatient cardiovascular clinic with a chief complaint of sudden  severe chest pain and shortness of breath  symptomology similar to a heart attack. However  an angiography hasn't shown any significant blockages in the coronary arteries.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a history of generalized anxiety disorder and has experienced recent bereavement due to the sudden death of her spouse. She does not have any diagnosed cardiac diseases  hypertension or diabetes previously.   Social History:  The patient is a non-smoker and has a moderate consumption of alcohol. She is not engaged in regular physical exercise.  Review of Systems:  The patient reports feeling stressed and has had sleep disturbances for the past three months due to grieving.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient appears anxious but in no acute distress  with normal heart sounds but with rapid  shallow breathing.  Diagnosis:  Based on her symptoms  demographics  and the recent emotional stress  a working diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome) is considered. This will be confirmed with further investigations including an echocardiogram and blood tests for cardiac enzymes.  Management Plan:  If the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is confirmed  the patient would typically be managed with supportive care  possibly including heart failure medications  and discussion of stress management techniques  counseling  or referral to a psychology/psychiatry service for management of her generalized anxiety disorder and bereavement. Long term follow-up of symptom management and cardiac function would also be planned.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,43,Patient Profile  Name: Elizabeth Anderson Age: 70 Sex: Female Marital Status: Widowed  Occupation: Retired school teacher Ethnic Background: Caucasian  Residence: Seattle  WA  Presenting Problem:  The patient was brought to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain that mimics a heart-attack  which developed suddenly after being informed that her grandson was involved in a serious vehicular accident. The pain radiates to the jaw  neck  and left arm. She also reported feeling ill and weakened.  Medical History:  1) Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension  well-controlled with daily medication (Lisinopril 10 mg).  2) Hyperlipidemia: Patient has elevated cholesterol levels  managed with daily statin medication (Atorvastatin 20 mg).  3) Anxiety Disorder: Patient has been dealing with anxiety  managed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Escitalopram 10 mg).  4) Pre-diabetes: Patient has an elevated fasting glucose level controlled with diet and exercise.  Most important based on patient's current condition: Hypertension  Anxiety Disorder  Family History: The patient’s mother suffered from coronary artery disease and died at the age of 75 from a massive heart attack. Her father lived till 89 and died from complications of dementia. Her older sister is alive and has type 2 diabetes and her younger brother died at 60 from lung cancer due to heavy smoking.  Past Surgical History:  The patient has had a total hysterectomy at age 50 due to uterine fibroids.  Social History:  Patient lives with her companion dog Spot  with a caregiver visiting each day for few hours. She is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or recreational drugs use  though admits to drinking 2 cups of black tea daily. She was a teacher  a profession that she describes as often stressful. She enjoys knitting and watercolor painting in her spare time. Patient appears cognitively intact and denies any memory changes or mood disorders apart from anxiety.  Current Medications: 1) Lisinopril 10mg daily 2) Atorvastatin 20mg at bedtime 3) Escitalopram 10mg daily   Allergies: No known drug allergies   Review of Systems: All other systems are reviewed and are normal except the cardiovascular  which is significant for chest pain.   Physical Examination:  Physical examination reveals a slightly obese elder woman in overall good health  with mild distress due to chest pain. Respiration and pulse rates are elevated but within normal range. Blood pressure is controlled at 125/80 mmHg. She has a grade 2/6 systolic murmur heard at the apex.  Problem Representation: 70-year-old Caucasian female with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  pre-diabetes  and anxiety  presenting with acute chest pain after stressful event  suggesting possible takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition known to occur more frequently in post-menopausal women experiencing severe stress. The condition mimics acute coronary syndrome  with similar initial symptoms. However  it does not involve blocked heart arteries. Instead  it involves weakening of the left ventricular myocardium.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,44,Patient Profile:   Name: Mrs. Karen Johnson Age: 68 years old Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Marital Status: Widowed Living Situation: Lives alone Smoking Status: Non-smoker Alcohol Consumption: Minimal  Presenting Problem:  Chief Complaint: Sudden  severe chest pain   Past Medical History:  1. Previous diagnosis of anxiety disorders. 2. Has been under significant stress due to recent death of husband. 3. Hypertension controlled with medication. 4. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. 5. No known history of coronary artery disease or heart failure.   Family History:  1. Mother had hypertension  diabetes  and died of heart disease. 2. Father had a stroke at 70.  Social History:  1. Lives alone in a suburban house. 2. Widowed  one son who lives in another state. 3. Non-smoker  occasional alcohol (one glass of wine/week).  Medication History:  1. Antihypertensive (Lisinopril)  2. Metformin for diabetes (Non-insulin dependent)  Physical Examination Summary:  1. Patient looks anxious. 2. Vital signs: Blood pressure 155/90 mmHg  heart rate 110bpm. 3. Heart sounds normal; no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. 4. ECG: indicative of acute stress cardiomyopathy (takotsubo).  This profile represents a typical patient with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  based on literature suggesting that it often presents in post-menopausal women  with a history of stress  anxiety  or emotional trauma  and who otherwise have no known history of heart disease. Other comorbid conditions  such as hypertension and diabetes  are also not uncommon in this age group. However  individual patient profiles may vary greatly.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,45,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Demographic Information: A 75-year-old female presents with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. She is of Asian descent and lives in a suburban neighborhood. - Occupation: The patient is retired; previously worked as a school teacher for over 30 years. - Social History: She is widowed and lives alone. She has two adult children who visit regularly. She is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol. - Current Medications: She takes low-strength aspirin (81mg) daily for cardiovascular risk reduction and Synthroid (levothyroxine) for hypothyroidism. - Family History: There is a family history of heart disease; her father died from myocardial infarction in his mid-60s and her elder brother underwent cardiac bypass surgery at age 70.  Clinical Presentation: The patient demonstrates symptoms indicative of acute coronary syndrome  including chest pain  shortness of breath  nausea  and anxiety. The onset of these symptoms coincided with the anniversary of her husband's death and appear to be more severe than her previous heart-related complaints.  Relevant Medical History:  - Diagnosed with hypothyroidism in her 60s. - Regularly monitors blood pressure; readings have been consistently borderline elevated (130/80 mm Hg). - Experienced a subarachnoid hemorrhage at age 68  warranting a short-term hospital stay and thorough neurological observation.  - Went through early menopause at the age of 45 due to a total abdominal hysterectomy due to fibroids. - Has osteoporosis - takes calcium and vitamin D supplements. - Underwent successful treatment for a stage IIA breast cancer at age 70. - Had a mild heart attack five years ago following the death of her husband.  Given the combination of acute heart-related symptoms  a past incidence of heart attack  the recent onset of severe emotional stress  and the absence of relevant cardiac risk factors such as smoking or obesity  this patient's profile is suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or """"broken heart syndrome""""  a transient cardiac syndrome that mimics acute coronary syndrome. It is essential to conduct appropriate diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment strategy. This may include an electrocardiogram  cardiac biomarker tests  coronary angiogram  and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging  among others."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,46,Patient Profile:  - Gender: Female - Age: 68 years old - Ethnicity: Caucasian  - Occupation: Retired school teacher - Marital Status: Widowed - Current Location: Urban neighborhood in New York  Medical History:  - High-blood stress-related job - History of hypertension - Non-smoker  - Mild alcohol consumption (glass of wine with dinner) - Regular exercise (low impact aerobics and walks) - Medicated under control diabetes   Current Presentation:  Recently experienced the death of her husband  causing acute emotional stress leading to symptoms mimicking a heart attack. EKG indicates abnormal heart function. Blood tests show slightly elevated cardiac enzymes. Coronary angiogram is clear and do not show any blockages that could cause heart attack symptoms.  Initial Diagnosis:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) is strongly suspected due to the onset of symptoms following acute emotional stress  along with the clear coronary angiogram  which is typical of this condition.  Problem Representation:  Caucasian elderly female with a history of hypertension and controlled diabetes acutely presents with symptoms suggestive of a myocardial infarction following recent significant emotional stress (husband's death). These symptoms arose despite her having an active lifestyle and moderate alcohol consumption habits. Examination findings and investigations exclude a typical heart attack  rendering takotsubo cardiomyopathy a feasible diagnosis. Her profile aligns with the typical demographic seen in literature for sufferers of takotsubo cardiomyopathy - postmenopausal  elderly females experiencing acute emotional distress. Further investigation is required to confirm this tentative diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,47,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Maria Richards Age: 68 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher Location: Lives alone in suburban area Lifestyle: Non-smoker and non-alcoholic  Present Problem: Mrs. Richards presented to the emergency department with sudden chest pain  shortness of breath  and felt like having a heart attack. She reported that the symptoms started suddenly following a stressful event  the passing of her husband a few days prior.  Past Medical History: 1. No history of coronary artery disease or cardiac issues. 2. No history of substance misuse. 3. History of controlled hypothyroidism. 4. No history of hypertension or diabetes. 5. No surgical history. 6. Regular follow-ups with the endocrinologist for management of hypothyroidism. 7. No known drug allergies.   Social History: 1. Widow  lives alone. 2. Has three grown-up kids living out of the state. 3. Ex-school teacher. 4. Non-smoker  non-alcoholic. 5. Regular mild exercise  but has become sedentary after retirement.  Family History:  1. No family history of heart diseases or any other major illness. 2. Husband died due to lung cancer.  This presentation corresponds with a typical takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome)  which often presents following a severe emotional stress event. Most common in post-menopausal women  takotsubo cardiomyopathy often presents as a sudden acute coronary syndrome- like symptoms  in the absence of any significant coronary atherosclerosis. The absence of significant substance misuse history  co-morbidities like diabetes and hypertension  or a history of pre-existing heart disease  is typical for this patient population. Family history of heart disease is also usually negative. The stressor is often a significant life event  such as a death in the family. The patient's reported symptoms  demographic factors  and past medical history align closely with these findings.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,48,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Demographic Information: 65-year-old Caucasian woman. - Occupation: Recently retired school teacher. - Marital Status: Widowed. - Children: Two adult sons living out of state.  Reason for Presentation: The patient experiences sudden intense chest pain following the recent unexpected death of her husband.  Medical History: - Chronic disease: She was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 60. Otherwise  no history of other significant medical conditions is reported. - Medication use: She has been taking antihypertensive medications (ACE inhibitors) regularly. - Lifestyle: Non-smoker and occasional alcohol user. - Family medical history: No history of heart disease in her immediate family.  Physical Examination and Diagnostic Testing:  - The patient experiences severe chest pain  which is relieved by nitroglycerin. - ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion on ECG are displayed. - Cardiac troponin T level is slightly increased. - No atherosclerotic lesions are indicated on coronary angiogram. - Transthoracic echocardiogram shows left ventricular apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of basal walls  and reduced LVEF.  Assessment:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome)  triggered by physical and emotional stress from her recent bereavement.  Plan:  - Initially manage the patient with standard heart failure medications (i.e. ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  diuretics). - Cardiac rehabilitation referral should be considered. - Subsequently  ongoing monitoring for cardiac function restoration and accompanying psychiatric referrals for potential grief counseling are required.  The problem representation for takotsubo cardiomyopathy in this case mirrors a typical patient as per literature  where it commonly affects postmenopausal women  is often brought on by intense emotional or physical stress  and exhibits typical clinical and diagnostic features such as sudden chest pain  ECG changes  increased troponin T levels  and characteristic wall motion abnormalities on transthoracic echocardiogram  without corresponding coronary artery disease.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,49,"Patient Profile:  Name: """"Linda"""" Age: 67 Sex: Female Ethnicity: White  Chief Complaint: Experiencing sudden intense chest pain and shortness of breath over the past few hours.  Past Medical History: Linda has a history of atrial fibrillation (managed with Beta blockers)  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension. She has no known history of coronary artery disease. She is also a recent widow; Her husband passed away 2 weeks ago.  Social History: - Non-smoker - Rare alcohol consumption - Major life stressor recently with the loss of her spouse  Physical Examination Findings:  Linda appears anxious and in acute distress due to chest pain. Vital signs show elevated blood pressure. Heart sounds are normal  and no obvious murmurs are noted.  Relevant Test Results: EKG test shows abnormalities indicative of a heart attack. The troponin levels are elevated  further supporting the clinical suspicion of myocardial infarction. Interestingly  Linda’s coronary angiogram test is clear  without any evidence of blocked arteries.  Possible Diagnosis:  Given Linda's demographic profile with being a post-menopausal woman  recent major emotional stressor  clinical presentation  and EKG-troponin findings with no blockages in coronary angiogram  there is high suspicion for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome.  Representation Rationalization: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy tends to be more common in post-menopausal women and often follows a severe emotional stress event. This acute condition mimics myocardial infarction symptoms but is characterized by the absence of occlusion in the coronary arteries which was incorporated into the problem representation. Linda's past medical history of atrial fibrillation  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension was included due to some studies showing a possible association between these conditions and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,50,Problem Representation:  Subject: Mrs. Suzanne K.  a 65-year-old Caucasian female  Presenting Problem: She has been experiencing shortness of breath  chest pain  and severe fatigue in the last few days. These symptoms are usually associated with minimal or no exertion.  Past Medical History:   1. Mrs. K comes from a stressful professional setting as a recently retired police officer.  2. She has been diagnosed with hypertension and has been on anti-hypertensive medications for the past ten years.  3. She also has a history of under-managed Type-2 Diabetes mellitus for which she takes oral anti-diabetic medications.  4. She had an episode of major depressive disorder after the death of her husband 5 years ago  treated with an SSRI.  5. She has a family history of heart disease but no personal record of any heart conditions. 6. She does not smoke or drink alcohol.  These details were collected based on the typical demographic representation found in the literature concerning patients affected by Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as broken heart syndrome. The disease is predominantly found in older women with a significant history of chronic psychological stress or depression. It's strongly associated with hypertension and Type-2 Diabetes mellitus. Patients mostly present with symptoms mimicking a heart attack like chest pain and shortness of breath  and many of them do not have a significant history of heart disease.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,51,Patient Representation:  Patient X is a 70-year-old Caucasian female presenting with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome. She has recently experienced significant emotional stress due to the loss of her spouse.  Demographics:  1. Gender: Prevalence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is significantly higher in women. Approximately 90% of reported cases are in females; hence  our patient is female.     2. Age: Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy can occur at any age  it is most prevalent in postmenopausal women between the ages of 58 and 75. Our patient falls into the higher end of this age group.  3. Race/ethnicity: While there is no specific race or ethnicity more prone to takotsubo cardiomyopathy  Caucasian patients predominantly feature in clinical studies. Accordingly  our patient is Caucasian.  Relevant Past Medical History:  1. Emotional/Psychological stress: Patient X recently experienced the death of her spouse  a major life event that resulted in profound emotional distress. This correlates with a typical trigger for takotobu cardiomyopathy  as emotional stressors are often precipitating factors for this condition.     2. Cardiovascular diseases – Patient X does not have a history of coronary artery disease or any other cardiovascular illnesses  which is consistent with many patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy who do not have significant coronary artery disease.  3. History of neurological disorders or psychiatric diseases: Patient X had a history of anxiety and depression which is pertinent  as there seems to be an association between takotsubo cardiomyopathy and neurological or psychiatric illnesses.  4. No substance abuse: Patient X has no history of substance abuse  including drugs or alcohol. However  it should be noted that in some cases  intake of stimulant medications or illicit substances might contribute to a takotsubo event.  This patient representation adheres to the demographic and medical history trends seen in the majority of takotsubo cardiomyopathy cases  according to available literature.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,52,Problem Representation:  Patient Description:  A 67-year-old Asian (especially Japanese) female presents with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left shoulder and shortness of breath following a significant stressful event in her life (death of a loved one). She has a documented history of anxiety and hypertension  which are both managed through medication.  Past Medical History: - Anxiety disorder - Hypertension - No documented history of coronary artery disease  - Non-smoker and occasional alcohol drinker - No documented drug abuse  - Family history of heart-related problems  Symptoms: - Severe chest pain - Left shoulder pain - Shortness of breath - Lightheadedness - Sudden emotional stress  Current Medications: - Antihypertensive  - Anxiolytic   Vitals upon presentation: - Increased heart rate - Increased blood pressure - Normal temperature  This presentation suits a typical patient with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition known to predominantly affect postmenopausal women and highly associated with sudden emotional stressors. It is also common in patients with a nexus of neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety disorders. Hypertension has been observed too in many patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  though they seldom have a history of coronary artery disease.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,53,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Sarah Thompson Age: 68 years  Sex: Female  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Social History: Widowed  recently retired from a teaching profession  living alone  non-smoker  moderate alcohol consumption. Stress history: Significant emotional stress due to recent death of her spouse.  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: Diagnosed 10 years ago  on regular antihypertensive medications. 2. Dyslipidemia: Diagnosed 5 years ago  on statins therapy. 3. History of anxiety disorder: Diagnosed 3 years ago  on regular medication.  Presenting symptoms: She presented to the emergency room with severe pain in the chest which started suddenly an hour ago. The pain is central  heavy in nature  radiating to the left shoulder and arm. She also reported feeling short of breath  experiencing nausea and episodes of light-headedness.   Current medications: Lisinopril  atorvastatin  alprazolam  Observations: - Blood pressure: 165/95 mmHg - Heart rate: 110 beats per minute - Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute - SPO2: 96% on room air.   This case presentation is typical of a patient with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as broken-heart syndrome. TCM is more common in postmenopausal women  often triggered by significant emotional or physical stress. Existing conditions such as hypertension and dyslipidemia can increase patients' risk for TCM  as does a history of mental health disorders like anxiety or depression. It's a form of acute heart failure that can mimic a heart attack  presenting with similar symptoms. Although Mrs. Thompson doesn't have a history of coronary artery disease  her older age  hypertension  and recent emotional distress (e.g.  bereavement) align with the demographic profile commonly associated with TCM.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,54,A 68-year-old post-menopausal Asian female presents to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain  mainly on the left side  radiating to her left arm. She reports that the pain started suddenly  while she was under significant emotional distress due to recent death of her spouse. She also experiences dyspnea and lightheadedness. The patient denies any history of smoking and substance abuse. However  she reports light alcohol consumption.  Family history includes one sister with coronary artery disease  and her mother had a stroke in her sixties. Her past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension with losartan  transient ischemic attacks  mild asthmatic component with no recent exacerbations  and borderline diabetes  controlled by diet and lifestyle. She denies any history of heart diseases.  Upon examination  she appears to be in acute distress. Laboratory tests demonstrate slightly elevated cardiac enzymes. Echocardiography shows left ventricular apical ballooning without coronal heart disease  suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The ST-elevation on electrocardiogram further supports this diagnosis. Due to the risk of complications  she is managed according to the latest guidelines for the treatment of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Problem List:  1. Chest pain. 2. Dyspnea. 3. Lightheadedness. 4. Hypertension. 5. Transient ischemic attacks. 6. Asthma. 7. Borderline diabetes. 8. Risk factor for cardiovascular disease (family history). 9. Acute stressor (death of spouse). 10. Suggested diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (pending confirmation).
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,55,Patient Representation:  Patient Name: Jane Doe  Age: 69 years  Gender: Female  Ethnicity: White (Caucasian)  Occupation: Retired teacher  Region of Residence: Urban area in US  Insurance: Medicare  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension controlled with medication  - History of anxiety disorders - Non-smoker  but drinks alcohol in moderate amounts - Chronic back pain due to degenerative disk disease - No history of diabetes  autoimmune diseases  or malignancies.  Family History:  - Mother had hypertension and died of a stroke at the age of 76 - Father had coronary artery disease and died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 71 - No siblings or children with known heart disease.  Presenting Symptoms:  Jane presented to the hospital with sudden onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath following a major argument with her neighbor. The pain was intense  located in the center of her chest  and did not radiate. She reported a feeling of fear and thought she was having a heart attack. She also had mild lightheadedness and felt like she might faint. No associated symptoms of nausea  vomiting  palpitations  or diaphoresis were reported.  Her vitals at presentation were:  - Blood pressure: 145/85 mmHg - Heart rate: 100 bpm - Temperature: 98.6 F (37 C) - Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths/minute   Clinical Assessment:  Based on her age  gender  presenting symptoms  and past medical history of anxiety  Jane fits the profile of a typical patient presenting with takotsubo cardiomyopathy which is also referred to as 'broken heart syndrome.' This condition is more commonly seen in postmenopausal women and can be triggered by physical or emotional stress. Majority of takotsubo cardiomyopathy cases present similarly to an acute coronary syndrome  which needs to be ruled out. This condition is often reversible with appropriate medical management.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,56,"Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian woman  married  retired teacher  living in the city with her husband.   Presenting Problem: She visited the emergency department (ED) complaining of severe chest pain she described as """"crushing."""" The chest pain started suddenly an hour ago when she received distressing news about her brother's sudden death. Along with the chest pain  she mentioned feeling short of breath and described a general feeling of weakness. She denies any symptoms of fever  cough  or recent travels.  Past Medical History: She has a history of hypertension  for which she has been taking hydrochlorothiazide for the last five years. In addition  she has a history of generalized anxiety disorder managed with an occasional alprazolam as needed. She doesn't smoke or consume alcohol and has no known drug allergies. Her family history is notable for coronary artery disease in her father who had his first myocardial infarction at the age of 60.  Patient Behavior and Communication: During the interview  the patient appeared anxious and visibly distressed  with occasional crying episodes. Though she was cooperative throughout  her anxiety seemed to hinder her concentration and communication.  This problem representation is largely based on the typical demographic of patients categorized with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  in which post-menopausal women  particularly those with a history of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety  are significantly overrepresented. In many cases  this syndrome is stimulated by acute emotional or physical stress  lending to its alternative name  """"broken heart syndrome."""" The medical history of hypertension is a common comorbidity  and the family history of coronary disease is noted due to relevance in differential diagnosis."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,57,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Age: 65-75 years  Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian  Chief Complaint: Acute onset chest pain resembling myocardial infarction  dyspnea  and nausea.  Past Medical History: 1. Patient has no prior history of coronary artery disease. 2. Chronic emotional stress or recent acute emotional stress event. 3. Patient has a history of anxiety disorders.  Family History: No significant family history of heart disease.  Social History: Retired  lives alone  non-smoker  occasional alcohol consumption.  Clinical Examination: ECG consistent with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)  ventricular arrhythmias or high-grade atrioventricular block  or T-wave inversion.   Laboratory Test Results: Troponin level is elevated  but less compared to typical STEMI patients.   Diagnosis: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy also known as broken-heart syndrome.  Clinical Course: In the setting of acute emotional stress  the patient presented with acute chest pain. The ECG showed changes suggestive of a heart attack. However  coronary angiogram demonstrated no significant blockages in coronary arteries. The unique contraction pattern of the heart (with the base contracting normally but the mid-segment and tip appearing to 'balloon out') led to the diagnosis.  Treatment: Supportive care including beta blockers  ACE inhibitors. The patient is also advised to seek stress management and mental health support to reduce emotional stress.   Prognosis: Good with appropriate management  symptoms usually resolve within weeks to months with no permanent damage to the heart.  This problem representation is consistent with demographic and clinical characteristics of typical Takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients as found in medical literature  including their gender (predominantly in post-menopausal women)  age (predominantly seen in older adults)  symptoms  stress as a triggering factor  ECG findings and absence of coronary artery disease- a unique feature differentiating it from typical myocardial infarction.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,58,"Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Susan Wilson  Age: 68 years   Sex: Female   Race: Caucasian  Occupational History: Retired elementary school teacher  Location: New York  USA  Chief Complaint:  Mrs. Wilson presents with acute chest pain  dyspnea  and slight dizziness  raising suspicion of a cardiac event.  Past Medical History:  She denies prior history of coronary artery disease  hypertension  or diabetes mellitus but has a known history of generalized anxiety disorder. Her father had early onset coronary artery disease and died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 59.  Lifestyle Factors:  Mrs. Wilson is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks red wine. She lives alone and has recently been under significant emotive stress following the death of her long-time pet.  Clinical Characteristics:  On examination  Mrs. Wilson is tachycardic and has slightly elevated blood pressure. Her electrocardiogram shows ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion  although her troponin levels are marginally elevated  not typically as high as in acute myocardial infarction. Echocardiogram reveals hypokinesis in the apical segments and hyperkinesis in the basal segments of the left ventricle  giving a distinctive 'takotsubo' or 'octopus pot' appearance.  Provisional Diagnostic Impression:  Given Mrs. Wilson's recent emotional stress  the absence of significant risk factors for coronary artery disease  her gender and age  and the characteristic 'Takotsubo' Echocardiogram finding  there is a high suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  This clinical case representation is in line with the demographic pattern of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy being more common in postmenopausal women  often triggered by physical or emotive stress  with the classical presentation of chest pain and evidence of cardiac muscle dysfunction. The demographic and clinical factors correlate with literature findings  pointing towards Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""" instead of a typical heart attack."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,59,Patient Profile: - Patient Initials: M.S. - Age: 68 years old - Sex: Female - Ethnicity: Japanese - Occupation: Retired school teacher - Marital Status: Widowed   Chief Complaint: M.S. presents with severe chest pain  similar to a heart attack  but doesn't have blocked coronary arteries or evidence of a heart attack on initial tests.   Symptom Onset: The symptoms started abruptly following the sudden death of her son  about two days ago.   Medical History: M.S. has a history of controlled hypertension for the past ten years. She doesn't have a history of coronary artery disease or any other known heart diseases.   Social History: She's a non-smoker and uses alcohol socially. She has a balanced diet and exercises moderately more than three times a week. No known drug abuse.  Medications: Her medications include lisinopril for hypertension. No known allergies to medications.  Family Medical History: No family history of coronary artery disease. Her mother had hypertension and her father had type 2 diabetes.  Psychiatric History: She has no history of psychiatric illness. However  recently  she has been under increased stress following the sudden loss of her son.  Physical Examination: Physical assessment revealed moderate distress related to pain. Elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Lung sounds clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes  rhonchi  or rales. No ankle or pedal edema.    This patient's profile is representative of the typical takotsubo cardiomyopathy patient as identified in literature. The condition frequently presents in postmenopausal women  with the mean age being around 67-70 years  and is often precipitated by a severe emotional stressor. Japanese and other Asian ethnicities have shown a higher incidence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The physical examination finding of clear lung sounds distinguishes takotsubo cardiomyopathy from congestive heart failure.

She has never smoked and drinks alcohol occasionally. She has been living alone since her husband passed away. She has a close relationship with her daughters and her grandchildren who live in the same city. She enjoys gardening and volunteers at the local library.   Review from Literature: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is predominantly reported in postmenopausal women with an average age of 61-76 years. Stressful events  both physical and emotional  often precede the presentation of this syndrome. Patients frequently experience chest pain and dyspnea. A medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and anxiety/depression is frequently reported in these patients. Mortality rates are low  but heart failure can occur in severe cases.

Presenting Complaint:     - Acute onset severe chest pain  described as a heaviness or crushing pressure which radiates to left arm     - Accompanied by shortness of breath and nausea.     - Symptoms began several hours following a severe argument with her son.  4. Socioeconomic and lifestyle factors:     - Recently widowed 1 year ago and experiencing high levels of stress and grief.     - Lives alone  Received social support from a son who lives nearby.     - Sedentary lifestyle due to constant fatigue and joint pain.     - Poor dietary habits  with a preference for processed foods and low intake of fruits and vegetables.  This representation is based on the established literature that individuals with takotsubo cardiomyopathy are predominantly post-menopausal women aged 58 to 75. Most patients have a history of a significant emotional or physical stressor. Mental health disorders are also commonly associated such as anxiety and depression  while hypertension is a common comorbidity. They also often present with symptoms that mimic acute coronary syndrome  such as chest pain and shortness of breath.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,62,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 68-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian woman with a history of recent extreme emotional stress. The patient was recently widowed and has been struggling with depression and anxiety. She also has a past medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. Although she is a non-smoker  she has a history of mild alcohol use. She has no known drug allergies. She is currently on her medications for hypertension and dyslipidemia. Her family history indicates a prevalence of cardiovascular diseases.  Presenting Problem: The patient presents to the emergency department with acute onset severe chest pain that radiates to her left arm. There is an associated shortness of breath  palpitations  nausea  and profuse sweating. The physical examination reveals elevated blood pressure. There are no signs of infection  trauma  or other acute illnesses.  Relevant Past Medical History: - Chronic Hypertension: Diagnosed 15 years ago  currently on Antihypertensive Drug Therapy. - Dyslipidemia: Diagnosed 10 years ago  currently on Statins. - Depression and Anxiety: Following the death of her spouse  managed with psychotherapy and antidepressants. - Previous diagnoses of panic attacks.  This clinical scenario is highly representative of a typical patient with takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome """" which is more commonly seen in postmenopausal women often with a background of emotional stress or distressing life events. History of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia increase the likelihood of cardiomyopathies. The acute phenomenon with symptoms mimicking a heart attack is also consistent with Takotsubo presentations."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,63,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Betty Truman Age: 68 years old Gender: Female Occupation: Retired High School English Teacher  Ethnicity: Caucasian   Presenting Problem: Mrs. Truman presented to the ER with severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started after receiving news of her son's sudden death. The pain was similar to that of a 'heart attack'.  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension - diagnosed 10 years ago 2. No history of heart disease 3. Anxiety disorder - diagnosed 5 years ago 4. No history of smoking/alcoholism/substance abuse 5. No prior surgeries or hospitalization  Family History: Both parents died of heart disease in late 70s. Elder sister living with type 2 Diabetes.  Lifestyle: Lives alone since her husband passed away 3 years ago. Has a pet dog for companionship. Follows a balanced diet with regular 30 min morning walks.  Notes: Considering the presentation and history  suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken-heart syndrome'  was raised. This typically presents in post-menopausal women following a highly stressful emotional or physical event. Echocardiography  EKG  and angiography might be needed to rule out other causes of chest pain  like myocardial infarction.  [Note: According to available literature  takotsubo cardiomyopathy is most common in postmenopausal women with a median age of 66-75 years. It often occurs after acute emotional or physical stress. Hypertension is a common comorbidity.]

Assessment: • Preliminary Diagnosis: Suspected Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""") due to typical presentation of severe cardiac symptomatology in conjunction with high stress levels  absence of coronary artery disease  and demographic alignment (postmenopausal woman of Asian descent).  Plan: • Immediate EKG  cardiac biomarker testing  and chest X-ray. • Consult to cardiology for possible echocardiogram and left heart catherization to rule out acute coronary syndrome and confirm the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  as clinically indicated. • Control blood pressure and manage anxiety. • Patient education: Explain the condition  its likely cause  and possible treatments. Discuss the importance of stress management and follow-up.  This patient representation portrays the typical demographic and clinical scenario for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy according to the literature. Over 90% of reported cases are in women aged 58 to 75. The condition is often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress  and is more common in individuals of Asian descent. The initial presentation can mimic acute coronary syndrome  although these patients often do not have the high-risk factors associated with the latter condition."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,65,Problem Representation:   Patient Profile:  1. Demographic Information:    - Gender: Female (90-95% of patients are females)    - Age: Over 60 years old (commonly between 58 and 75)    - Race/Ethnicity: The incidence rate is not significantly different between Caucasian  African-Americans  Asians  or Hispanic ethnicities.    2. Current Complaints:    - Chest pain (often severe  described as hurting or pressure)    - Shortness of breath (somewhat less often)    - Nausea  abdominal pain  fainting  and other symptoms mimicking heart attack can also be observed.  3. Past Medical History:    - Psychiatric disorders like anxiety or depression (28.9%)    - Neurologic disorders (35.4%)    - No history of coronary heart disease (takotsubo cardiomyopathy often affects people with no history of heart disease)    - Around 55% of patients have hypertension    - Around 15% of patients have diabetes    - Previous episodes of severe emotional  physical  or psychological stress. Takotsubo  also known as “broken-heart syndrome ” has been linked to stressful events.  4. Lifestyle Factors:    - Preceding stressful event (either emotional such as divorce  death of a loved one  etc. or physical such as surgery  asthma attack etc.)    - Slightly more prevalent in postmenopausal women; hormonal changes may be a contributing factor.  5. Family History:    - Heart disease: Even though takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not usually associated with heart disease  a family history may predispose certain individuals.  This profile presents a typical patient with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  based on the associated demographics and risk factors within the literature. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,66,"Problem Representation  Patient Information: 64-year-old female  of Asian descent  living by herself in a suburban neighborhood. She is a widower with two grown-up children living out-of-town. Her Body Mass Index (BMI) is 23 and she leads a moderately active lifestyle. She has a history of depression  for which she has been taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the last 15 years. She quit smoking 10 years ago and occasionally consumes alcohol. She has no previous cardiac issues or hypertension.   Presenting Issue: The patient was admitted into the hospital with acute chest pain  resembling signs of a heart attack such as profuse sweating  sudden weakness  and acute shortness of breath. The episode occurred after receiving news of her son's fatal accident.   Evaluation: On examination  her pulse is high and irregular (tachycardia)  her blood pressure is slightly elevated to 145/90 mmHg  and she is experiencing difficulty catching her breath. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation  mimicking myocardial infarction. However  cardiac enzyme levels (Troponin) although elevated  are not consistent with major myocardial damage typical of a heart attack.   Diagnosis: Upon assessment of the patient's basic characteristics  circumstances leading up to her hospitalization  her symptoms  and her medical results  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) or """"broken heart syndrome"""" is suspected. This syndrome is thought to be triggered by emotional stress  and it affects primarily postmenopausal women. Echocardiogram or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide further confirmation by revealing typical """"apotico-ballooning"""" of the left ventricle.   This patient represents a typical TCM case: she is a postmenopausal woman with a recent severe emotional stressor  her symptoms and ECG mimic a heart attack  but her cardiac enzymes don't follow the pattern you'd expect with a heart attack  suggesting TCM instead."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,67,Patient Representation:  Profile: - Age: 72  - Sex: Female - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired school teacher  Problem Representation:  Ms. Stuart is a 72-year-old Caucasian female who has presented to the emergency department with sudden chest pain and difficulty breathing. Despite having a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  her symptoms have never manifested this severely. She describes the pain as a heavy crushing sensation in the middle of her chest  radiating towards her left shoulder and arm. She is visibly anxious and appears in distress. She reports that she developed these symptoms a couple of hours after receiving news about the sudden death of her older brother.  Medical History: - Hypertension for the past 10 years  managed with Lisinopril. - Hyperlipidemia for the past 5 years  managed with Atorvastatin.  - History of smoking (quit 15 years ago). - No known previous episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath.  - No diabetes  trauma  or surgeries in the past. - No known drug allergies.  Family History: - Father died of myocardial infarction at age 70.  - Mother had hypertension  died at age 80 due to stroke. - Her older brother (recently deceased) had type 2 diabetes.  Demographics and past medical history are consistent with typical patient presentations for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  as evidenced by literature which indicates the mean age of patients to be in the late 60s to early 70s with it being 9 times more likely in women  often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress (in this case  the death of her brother). The majority of these patients often have a history of hypertension. Caucasian race and hyperlipidemia are also factors reported in some studies.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,68,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mrs. A is a 68-year-old  post-menopausal Asian woman who presents with a chief complaint of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She describes her symptoms as similar to those she experienced during past episodes of anxiety and panic attacks. She denies any substance use  primarily alcohol and smoking.  Relevant Past Medical History:  She has a history of hypertension for which she takes medications regularly. She also has a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) and has had several periods of high emotional stress in the recent past. She has no known history of coronary artery disease  but there is a familial history of heart disease.  Current Medications: She is on Amlodipine 5mg  once daily  for hypertension  and takes Sertraline 100mg  daily  for MDD.   Narrative: Mrs. A began experiencing symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath after an intense argument with her son. She describes the pain as tightness in the center of her chest  that came on suddenly and is constant  and rates it an 8 of 10 in severity. On arrival to the emergency department  an EKG showed ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V6  I  aVL indicative of an anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  a subsequent coronary angiogram did not demonstrate any significant obstructive coronary artery disease. Echocardiogram results indicate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical ballooning and carinal hyperkinesis  suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Conclusions: Given Mrs. A's demographic information  history of hypertension  and emotional stressors  along with the lack of obstructive coronary artery disease evident on angiogram and left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning on echocardiogram  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as """"Broken Heart Syndrome"""") can be considered. The chest pain she experienced may be a result of this condition  where the heart muscle weakens due to severe emotional distress. The pattern of symptoms is consistent with the typical presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy that is seen more frequently in post-menopausal women with a history of emotional stress or psychiatric disorders. This diagnosis should be confirmed with a cardiac MRI.    Note: Increased prevalence of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in post-menopausal women has been observed in literature  often triggered by emotional or physical stress. Asians  particularly Japanese  are noted to have a higher incidence  possibly related to both genetic and cultural factors."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,69,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Age: 68 years old  - Sex: Female  - Ethnicity: Caucasian  - Occupation: Retired schoolteacher  - Place of Residence: Urban area in the northern United States  - Marital Status: A widow with two adult children residing in different states - Socioeconomic Status: Middle class  Past Medical History:   - No known cardiovascular or conductive heart diseases  - No prior surgery or hospitalization  - No history of smoking  illicit drug use or excessive consumption of alcohol  - Diagnosed with general anxiety disorder ten years ago  - Regularly treated for hypertension from the past 5 years  - Current medications include SSRIs for anxiety and a beta-blocker for hypertension - Occasional insomnia  - Family history of cardiovascular diseases in later life stages   Current Situation: She presented with sudden chest pain and her doctor  suspecting a heart attack  admitted her to a hospital. She also reported profound emotional upset and stress over the past few days due to a sudden death in the extended family.  Based on demographic data  a significant majority of patients diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) tend to be postmenopausal women with an average age of 67. They often have a history of neurologic or psychiatric disorders. They also present with symptoms resembling a heart attack following a severe emotional or physical stress trigger. While underlying cause is unclear  it is thought to involve a surge of stress hormones stunning the heart  leading to changes in heart muscle cells or coronary blood vessels. Despite no blockage in the coronary arteries  the heart’s reaction to these stress hormones causes one part of the heart to temporarily enlarge and not pump properly.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,70,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   Ms. Brenda is a 68-year-old  Caucasian female who presents to the Emergency Department with the primary complaint of sudden-onset  severe chest pain. She is a widow and lives alone. She has two grown children who live in nearby suburbs. She is a retired high school teacher  and enjoys reading and gardening in her spare time.   Clinical History:  She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are controlled by medication. She has never smoked  has no history of illicit drug use  and drinks socially. She does not have any known history of cardiac dysfunctions.   Recent Events:  Recently  she has been under increased stress following the death of her beloved sister two weeks ago. She has been experiencing feelings of intense grief and anxiety ever since  even mentioning to her son that her heart 'feels broken'.  Clinical Presentation:  Today  she experienced a sudden chest pain while weeding her garden  which she describes as a """"sharp  tearing sensation"""" in the center of her chest  radiating to her left arm. It was associated with shortness of breath and light-headedness.  Based on her demographic profile  clinical history  and presenting symptoms  it is suspected that Brenda may be suffering from takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as 'broken heart syndrome')  a condition commonly associated with emotional stress and more prevalent in postmenopausal women.   Discussion:  The demographic profile presented here is consistent with typical takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients as represented by recent literature  which suggests a mean age of 66-68 years  significant female predominance (especially postmenopausal women)  and Caucasian ethnicity. Additionally  the literature suggests that emotional triggers like intense grief or anxiety can precipitate the onset of takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,71,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Janet Brown Age: 68 years old  Gender: Female Ethnicity: White  Occupation: Retired  Smoker: Non-Smoker Ethanol consumption: None   Presenting Symptoms: Chest discomfort  rapid and irregular heartbeat  shortness of breath  arm pain  fainting.  Medical History:  Mrs. Janet Brown  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with severe chest discomfort  abnormal heartbeat  shortness of breath  arm pain  and a recent history of fainting spells. She complained of these symptoms starting abruptly after receiving news of her son's unexpected death.   She has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but no history of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction. She's been on antihypertensive medications and statins for the past 10 years. Her lifestyle is sedentary since her retirement and she confessed experiencing increased loneliness and social isolation after her only child moved out. She doesn't smoke or consume alcohol  and there's no family history of premature cardiovascular diseases.  Her recent emotional upheaval coupled with her presenting symptoms puts her at risk for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome)  a form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy  usually triggered by severe stress.  Note: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy predominantly affects postmenopausal women and is triggered commonly by physical or emotional stress. The patient's demographic profile aligns with common presentations of the condition in literature. Further  her history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia albeit without coronary heart disease holds consistent with such patients. Her emotional stress due to her son's death is the likely triggering event in this scenario.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,72,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  A 68-year old Caucasian woman.  Primary Complaint:  Sudden chest pain and shortness of breath after a stressful event   Relevant Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  and postmenopausal status. She does not smoke  has no history of coronary heart disease and has not had a heart attack in the past. However  she does report experiencing intense emotional stress shortly before the onset of the symptoms.  Demographic Information:  The patient works in a highly stressful profession and lives alone. She has two grown children who live in another city. She reports consuming alcohol socially. She is not physically active and has a BMI of 27.   Family History:  Her mother had hypertension  and her father had late onset diabetes.   Medications:  She has been prescribed medication for hypertension (Amlodipine) and dyslipidemia (Atorvastatin).  Review of Systems:  She reports fatigue and palpitations.  Physical Exam:  On examination  she appears anxious but is in no acute distress. Her blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg  heart rate 100 beats/min  and respiratory rate 20 breaths/min. There are no significant findings in the lung and abdominal examination.  This patient's demographic and medical representation includes features highly characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is also known as """"broken heart syndrome."""" According to literature  this condition is most commonly seen in postmenopausal women and often precipitated by severe emotional stress. The patient's hypertension and dyslipidemia are also common comorbidities found in takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  NOTE: The diagnosis will ultimately depend on further tests like electrocardiogram  echocardiogram  and/or cardiac catheterization. Always consult a healthcare professional if you suspect a medical condition."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,73,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Evelyn Reid Age: 67 years Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Presenting Symptoms:  Mrs. Reid succinctly complains of severe chest pain similar to a heart attack. She had experienced a stressful event a week ago and the pain started abruptly just after a stressful event. She also reports difficulty in breathing and a feeling of faintness.  Past Medical History: - Hypertension for 15 years  medication controlled - Hypercholesterolemia for 10 years  medication controlled - Non-smoker - No history of drug abuse - Moderate alcohol drinker. - No known allergies - No family history of cardiomyopathy or early heart disease - Mrs. Reid has no prior known heart disease  Demographic Characterization:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often termed 'broken heart syndrome ' primarily affects women aged 58-75. 85-90% of diagnosed patients are postmenopausal women (The American Journal of Cardiology  2006). Hence  the demographic information in Mrs. Reid's case (67 years) is consistent with the literature.  Relevant Medical History:  Stress-related heart problems are relatively common in patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Circulation  2005). Mrs. Reid's symptoms onset after a stressful event. Also  her history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia put her at an elevated risk  even though she has them controlled with medication.   Although Mrs. Reid does not have a family history of cardiomyopathy or a personal history of heart disease - both of which may slightly increase risk - her lack of prior known cardiac disease aligns with common presentations of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  as 90% of cases occur in people without significant coronary artery disease (European Heart Journal  2018). Furthermore  the abrupt onset of severe chest pain right after a stressful event further supports the suspected diagnosis  as takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically presents as a sudden heart attack-like event triggered by intense emotional or physical stress.   In conclusion  Mrs. Reid's demographic profile  past medical history  and presenting symptoms are all consistent with a typical patient experiencing takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,74,Demographic Characterization:  Patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female named Mrs. Jane Smith. The patient is married  retired  and resides in an urban area. She is a non-smoker  consumes alcohol socially  and does not have a history of recreational drug use.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Smith has a history of hypertension  which she manages with daily anti-hypertensive medication. She suffers from occasional migraines and had a complete hysterectomy 10 years ago. She does not have a history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or other known cardiovascular diseases.   Problem Presentation:  Three days ago  Mrs. Smith experienced an intense episode of emotional stress due to the sudden death of a close friend. She initially reported symptoms that closely mimic a heart attack  such as chest pain and shortness of breath  but subsequent investigations  including electrocardiogram (ECG) and serum cardiac biomarkers  did not show any significant abnormalities typically associated with an acute coronary syndrome.  However  her echocardiogram portrayed regional wall motion abnormalities  specifically in the apices of the left ventricle  leading to a 'ballooning' appearance of the ventricles characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Notably  coronary angiography did not show any significant blockages  which further supported the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy rather than a traditional heart attack.  Most recent vitals include: - Blood pressure: 130/85 mmHg  - Heart rate: 82 beats per minute - Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute - Temperature: 98.3℉ - Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air  Patient was admitted to the cardiology ward for monitoring and supportive treatment.   The above represents a typical takotsubo cardiomyopathy patient. As described in the literature  this syndrome most frequently affects postmenopausal women  presents after an episode of severe physical or emotional stress and with symptoms resembling an acute myocardial infarction. Although the mechanism is not fully understood  the presenting symptoms are thought to result from a surge in stress hormones causing temporary disruption of the heart's normal pumping function  particularly at the apex of the left ventricle.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,75,Patient Profile:   Name: Jane Doe Age: 72 Gender: Female Race: White Occupation: Retired Marital status: Widowed Residence: Lives alone in an urban setting  Problem representation/patient Information:  Ms. Doe  a 72-year-old white widow who lives alone  presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset chest pain. The pain began 2 hours ago and has been constant and severe  radiating to the left arm. This pain is associated with shortness of breath  nausea  and persistent sweating. Earlier this week  she experienced the death of her beloved pet  causing significant emotional stress.  Past Medical History: 1) History of hypertension for 10 years  irregularly controlled with antihypertensive drugs. 2) History of type II diabetes mellitus for the past 5 years  controlled with metformin. 3) No history of coronary heart disease or any previous cardiac or cerebrovascular events. 4) She does not smoke or drink alcohol.  Family History: 1) Mother had a history of cardiovascular disease. 2) Father passed away in his 80s due to natural causes. He did not have a diagnosed cardiovascular disease.  Physical Examination at Presentation: Blood pressure: 160/90 mmHg Heart rate: 105 bpm (regular) Respiration rate: 20 breaths/min Oxygen saturation: 95% on room air  Problem Representation:   This presentation is consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly known as broken heart syndrome  which usually presents similarly to acute coronary syndrome. This condition is most prevalent in post-menopausal women and is often preceded by a significant physical or emotional stress event. Her history of hypertension could also potentially increase her risk. Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy can mimic acute coronary syndromes  patients often do not have significant coronary atherosclerosis  consistent with Ms. Doe's medical history.  Sources:  1.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,76,Patient Profile: - Gender: Female  - Age: 72 years old - Race: White  - Marital status: Widowed   Presenting Complaint: - Chest pain - Shortness of breath - Mild confusion   Past Medical and Social History: The patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. She has a history of essential hypertension  anxiety and panic disorders  which are controlled with metoprolol and fluoxetine. Her record shows a recent stressful life event  the death of her husband 3 months ago.  The patient's family history reveals no history of cardiac diseases. There is no history of sudden death  genetic diseases  or any chronic illnesses.   Patient’s Functional Status: Prior to the current admission  the patient was independent for all activities of daily living. She lives alone and manages her daily activities herself.  Problem Representation:  A 72-year-old widowed white female with a past medical history of essential hypertension and anxiety and panic disorders  currently controlled on medication  presents with chest pain and shortness of breath accompanied by mild confusion. The patient has been dealing with significant emotional stress after the death of her husband. Her vitals and physical exam suggest a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  warranting further cardiac investigation.   This representation is based on the commonly reported demographic characteristics of patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy where the majority are post-menopausal women  often with a recent history of severe emotional stress. It is also commonly associated with psychiatric disorders  like anxiety disorder  and medical comorbidities like hypertension. Although this condition can rarely present with atypical symptoms  such as confusion  it predominantly presents with chest pain and dyspnea  simulating an acute coronary syndrome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,77,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information: Patient: Female Age: 68 years old Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Recently retired from a stressful managerial position  Psychosocial Characteristics: The patient lives alone. She recently lost her husband and have been experiencing severe emotional stress. She has a history of anxiety and depression.   Medical History: 1) The patient has been experiencing significant recent emotional stress following the death of her husband. 2) The patient has a longstanding history of hypertension  which is currently managed with medication. 3) The patient has a past medical history of hyperlipidemia.  4) The patient has no known history of coronary artery disease or any previous cardiac conditions. 5) The patient is a nonsmoker and has moderate alcohol use.  6) Family history reveals her mother died of a heart attack at an early age.  Recent Symptoms: The patient presented with symptoms characteristic of an acute coronary syndrome  including acute chest pain and shortness of breath  which started suddenly after receiving news about a financial crisis.     Physical Examination: Her blood pressure on presentation was 150/95 mmHg and her heart rate was 110 bpm. No significant abnormalities in other systems were noted on physical examination.   Given these symptoms  demographic factors  and medical history  there's a reason to suspect Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  as the condition is prevalent in postmenopausal women and can be triggered by severe emotional stress. The patient's recent emotional trauma (the death of her husband and financial crisis)  anxiety  and depressive history combined with the acute onset of symptoms are highly suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Further diagnostic testing  including an ECG  blood tests for cardiac enzymes and echocardiogram  should be carried out to confirm this suspected diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,78,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Ms. Rane is a 68-year-old  Caucasian female  recently widowed. She has a body mass index (BMI) of 29 and is a former smoker who quit 20 years ago. She maintains a moderate level of physical activity  does not consume alcohol  and follows a balanced diet. She lives alone and is currently retired.  Presenting Complaint: Ms. Rane presents with acute onset chest pain  shortness of breath that has been worsening over the last few days.  Past Medical History: Ms. Rane has a medical history significant for type-2 diabetes mellitus (well-controlled; HbA1c levels consistent around 7% over the past year) and hypertension (fairly controlled on medications). She does not have a known history of psychiatric disorders. Recently  she lost her husband due to a prolonged illness  causing her significant emotional distress.   Family History: Her mother had ischemic heart disease  and her father had a cerebrovascular accident. There is no known family history of any genetic disorders.   Clinical Scenario: Given that Ms. Rane's symptoms have presented soon after the emotional trauma of her husband's death  and her age  sex  and history of hypertension and diabetes  a differential diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""") should be considered  notwithstanding other possibilities like acute coronary syndrome or heart failure.   Relevant Epidemiological Information: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy predominantly affects post-menopausal women. Current literature states a strong association of this syndrome with emotional or physical stressors. Patients often present with symptoms mimicking myocardial infarctions such as chest pain or shortness of breath. The disease prevalence is about 2% in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome-like symptoms  but this prevalence increases to about 5–6% when looking exclusively at female patients. Risk factors such as advanced age  postmenopausal status  and a history of neurologic/psychiatric disorders have also been reported.  "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,79,Problem Representation:  Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  who lives alone and has a high-stress job as a corporate executive.  Chief Complaint: The patient presents to the emergency room complaining of severe chest pain and difficulty breathing  describing the pain as similar to what she imagines a heart attack would feel like.  Relevant Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  which is well-controlled with medication. She has not had any previously diagnosed cardiac issues. However  she admits to experiencing episodes of severe emotional stress due to her high responsibility job and the recent death of her spouse. She also reports a history of smoking  though she quit five years ago. Despite these factors  she typically exercises regularly and maintains a mostly healthy diet.  Relevant Family History: The patient's mother and grandmother both died of heart disease in their late 60s. The patient's father lived until his late 70s and died of lung cancer.  Social History: The patient is a widow and lives alone. She is financially stable and expresses that she often feels the urge to continually succeed in her job despite her age. Although she has a close relationship with her grown sons and grandkids  she has few other close relationships in her life. She has no history of alcohol or drug abuse.  Physical Exam: The physical examination reveals an elevated heart rate (tachycardia) and slightly elevated blood pressure.  Problem Representation Summary: The demographic representation and medical history of this patient are consistent with literature related characteristics of typical patients presenting with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as Broken Heart Syndrome). Generally  these patients are post-menopausal females  often presenting after a stressful event with symptoms similar to a myocardial infarction. Based on this information  the patient's presenting symptoms  and the prevalence of this condition in women of this age  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy should be considered as a potential diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,80,Problem Representation:  Subject: Mrs. Anne Thompson  70-year-old Caucasian female.   Chief Complaint: Transient acute chest pain and shortness of breath  occurring during times of intense emotional stress.   Past Medical History: - Anxiety disorder diagnosed 5 years ago  for which she has been intermittently adhering to CBT. - Hyperlipidemia managed with diet control and atorvastatin. - Postmenopausal status  no hormone replacement therapy.   Social History:  - Widow for 10 years  living alone. - Retired school teacher. - Non-smoker  light alcohol consumption. - Active church member  but recently expressed feeling of loneliness to her pastor.   Family History:  - Mother diagnosed with ischemic heart disease  passed away at the age of 75. - No history of heart diseases in siblings.   Recent Stressors: - Death of a close friend 2 months ago. - Financial stress related to home repairs.   Objective Data: - EKG showing ST-segment elevation. - Negative Troponin test. - Echocardiography showing apical ballooning of left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction.   Assessment: Based on her symptoms during extreme stress  EKG findings  and echocardiogram showing left ventricular apical ballooning  Mrs. Thompson is likely presenting with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome).   Note: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is commonly seen in postmenopausal women  typically over age 50  following an episode of extreme emotional stress. It is characterized by transient left ventricular apical ballooning and mimics the clinical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. However  troponin levels are usually normal  and coronary arteries are typically unremarkable  which differentiates it from myocardial infarction.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,81,"Problem Representation:   Patient's Profile:   The presenting patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian woman  consistent with the demographic most commonly affected by takotsubo cardiomyopathy  as mentioned in the literature which specifies that 90% of the cases concern post-menopausal women.  Vital signs: are within normal limits.   Presenting Complaint:  The patient presents to the emergency department with acute onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  associated with shortness of breath. She describes the pain as """"crushing """" similar to a previous myocardial infarction. She says the symptoms began earlier in the day  shortly after she received news of her sister's death.   Past Medical History:  Have the past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia and a previous myocardial infarction one year ago. Medications include a beta-blocker  statin and daily aspirin. She has a known allergy to penicillin  which causes a rash. A 30-pack year smoking history  quit 10 years ago. Family history is notable for coronary artery disease in her father and brother  both diagnosed in their 60s.  Social History:  She's a retired school teacher  widowed with three grown children. She has some peripheral involvement from her children  and a strong community network through her church.   Physical Exam:  On examination  she appears anxious. She's tachycardic and tachypnoeic with clear lung fields. Heart sounds are normal without murmurs  rubs or gallops. There's no peripheral edema or jugular venous distention.   Impression and Plan:  Given her symptoms  history of a prior myocardial infarction  and recent severe emotional stress  she's suspected to have takotsubo cardiomyopathy. An electrocardiogram  chest X-ray  and troponin levels are ordered to rule out acute coronary syndrome. If there's no evidence of an acute coronary event  the plan includes performing an echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Based on the results  treatment may include beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  or diuretics."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,82,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Gender: Female Age: 68 years old Ethnicity: Caucasian   Past Medical History: 1. History of hypertension 2. History of hyperlipidemia 3. History of type 2 diabetes  Presenting Problems and Symptoms: 1. Chest pain 2. Shortness of breath 3. Weakness 4. Fainting or near-fainting spells 5. Palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeats)  Background Information: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a disease that typically affects postmenopausal women. This disease is often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress  causing severe reversible left ventricular dysfunction. The presentation often resembles an acute coronary syndrome  but there is absent obstructive coronary disease. In the majority  there is complete recovery within weeks.  Epidemiologic studies reveal that 90% of reported cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy are in women 58 to 75 years. The prevalence in the Caucasian race is significantly higher. The patient has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes  all of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease and have been associated with cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  This representation paints a picture of a typical patient that may present with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  highlighting essential aspects such as demographics  detailed past medical history  and presenting symptoms. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,83,Problem Representation:  Patient: John Doe  a 70-year-old Caucasian male.  Current Complaint: Presented to ER with sudden onset of severe  sharp chest pain  lasting for around an hour  accompanied by shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: Patient has a history of hypertension  controlled by medication. Recently  he lost his wife due to cancer  making him constantly stressed and anxious.  Psychosocial History: He lives alone and is retired. He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol socially. He has a robust social life and enjoys playing golf with friends.   Family History: His father suffered from coronary artery disease  and his sister is a known hypertensive.  Clinical Findings: ECG showed ST-segment elevation in precordial leads. Initial blood tests  including cardiac enzymes  are elevated. Further evaluation with echocardiography revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle.  Problem Statement: John  a 70-year-old man with a personal history of hypertension and a recent history of emotional trauma  presents with sudden onset chest pain  elevated cardiac enzymes  and echocardiographic findings suggestive of left ventricular apical ballooning  leading to a strong suspicion of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Relevant Literature: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy  often affects post-menopausal women but can also affect men. It is frequently associated with physical or emotional stress. The exact cause is unknown  but possible triggers involve high levels of stress hormones. Symptoms mimic those of a heart attack and include chest pain and shortness of breath. Diagnosis might involve coronary angiography to rule out a heart attack  echocardiogram to assess heart's pumping function and detect distinctive ballooning pattern of the left ventricle  and blood tests to check heart damage and other diseases. Treatment focuses on relieving the symptoms with medications. The patient's prognosis generally tends to be good  with most people recovering within weeks to months without permanent damage to the heart.  Rationale for Approach: Given the patient's demographic  psychosocial stressors  and a clinical presentation mimicking an acute coronary syndrome  as well as the distinctive echocardiographic finding of apical ballooning  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is highly likely in this scenario. Recognizing this diagnosis is crucial as it can significantly affect the patient's management.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,84,Patient Profile  Name: Mrs. Susan Walters Age: 68 years Sex: Female Race/ Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher Location: Suburban  USA  Chief Complaint: Suddenly onset intense chest pain extending to left arm that started 2 hours ago while undergoing intense emotional distress caused by learning about the unexpected death of a loved one.  Past Medical History: History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled with medication. Non-diabetic. Non-smoker. Moderate social drinker. History of major depressive disorder in remission  controlled with antidepressants.  Family History: Mother and maternal aunt have history of breast cancer. Father had coronary artery disease. No known family history of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Physical examination: BP: 160/90 mm Hg Heart Rate: 110 bpm She appears to be in acute distress. On Cardiovascular examination: There are no added heart sounds or rubs. There is no jugular venous distension.  Investigations requested: 1. 12-lead EKG 2. Chest X-ray 3. Echocardiogram 4. Blood tests including cardiac biomarkers 5. Cardiac MRI or coronary angiogram if needed.  Problem Representation: Susan is a 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presents with acute onset of chest pain and emotional distress consistent with a potential diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. These symptoms started in an emotionally stressful situation. Given her age  sex and the nature of her presentation  she needs urgent evaluation for other differential diagnoses including acute coronary syndrome. Her late-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) needs medical attention since MDD is seen more frequently among Takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients. Her family history of breast cancer can suggest a genetic predisposition to some diseases; however  there is no known association with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  combined with her acute onset stress  suggest a probable cause of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  but ACS needs to be ruled out first. Additionally  her lifestyle  particularly social drinking  could contribute to her risk factors.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,85,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 68-year-old Caucasian female patient presents to the emergency department. She is widowed and lives alone.  Presenting Complaint: The patient reports experiencing severe chest pain that started a few hours ago.   History of Presenting Complaint: She describes the pain as “crushing” and says it radiates to her left arm and neck  similar to a previous myocardial infarction (MI). Along with the chest pain  she also feels shortness of breath.   Past Medical History: Patient has a known history of hypertension which is controlled on medication  and she had a myocardial infarction three years ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohol.   Family History: No known history of any cardiovascular disease in her family.   Social History: The patient admits to experiencing a considerable amount of stress; her husband passed away six months ago and she has been struggling to cope with the loss.  Clinical Examination: Patient appears anxious. Vitals show elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Cardiac auscultation reveals a regular rhythm with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  Summary: This is a 68-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and myocardial infarction  presenting with severe chest pain and shortness of breath suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome.  Based on patient age  gender  emotional stress  presentation  and medical history  a strong consideration must be given to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome). This syndrome often mimics symptoms of MI and is commonly triggered by severe emotional stress  such as grief. The diagnosis can be confirmed by coronary angiography and left ventriculogram  revealing a characteristic pattern of apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basal walls.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,87,"Patient Presentation:  Patient Demographics: A 68-year-old postmenopausal Hispanic woman.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents in the emergency department with sudden severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. She also reports experiencing episodes of breathlessness and lightheadedness.  History: The patient's symptoms started abruptly earlier in the day while she was attending her husband's funeral. She describes the pain as """"crushing"""" and """"heaviness """" similar to what she imagines a heart attack would feel like. She initially thought it was stress or anxiety but decided to seek help due to the severity and persistence of the symptoms.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension for which she is taking hydrochlorothiazide  diabetes mellitus type 2 managed with metformin and a well-controlled  long-standing anxiety disorder managed with fluoxetine. She quit smoking ten years ago  but had smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for about 20 years. She reports moderate alcohol consumption  and her Body Mass Index (BMI) is within the normal range. She has no family history of heart disease.  Social History: The patient had been the primary caregiver for her ailing husband until his recent death. She reports significant life-stress related to this  and now  dealing with his death.  Review of Systems:  Besides the present complaints of chest pain  dyspnea and lightheadedness  she also reports feeling fatigued over the past few weeks but had attributed this to recent stress. There are no positive findings in the other systems.   This clinical scenario represents a typical case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" that is often precipitated by intense emotional or physical stress and predominantly affects postmenopausal women. It mimics the symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction but is characterized by reversible left ventricular dysfunction."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,88,Patient Information:  Patient demographics: 67-year-old Caucasian female  Occupation: Recent retirement from a high-stress job as an executive in a large corporation Living situation: Lives alone Current presenting symptoms: Recent episode of severe chest pain  shortness of breath   Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension diagnosed 3 years ago  currently on antihypertensives 2. History of anxiety and panic disorders  treated with therapy and medications 3. No history of smoking or alcohol addiction 4. Negative for diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or any other heart diseases 5. No family history of heart disease  Recent life circumstances: She had been through a highly stressful event in the past month  involving the death of a close family member.  A brief background: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in which the left ventricle of the heart is weakened and balloons outwards  changing its shape. This condition is most common in postmenopausal women and is often precipitated by severe stress  either physical or emotional. The symptoms can mimic those of a heart attack  including chest pain and shortness of breath.  This patient fits the typical demographic for takotsubo cardiomyopathy - she is a post-menopausal woman who recently experienced a severe emotional stressor. Her hypertension could potentially make her more susceptible to heart conditions. Her history of anxiety and panic disorders could also potentially contribute to her risk of stress-induced conditions.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,89,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. X is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  recently widowed  who presents with acute onset of chest pain and dyspnea. The chest pain is severe and described as a sharp sensation in the middle of her chest that radiates towards her left shoulder and arm. The pain started suddenly while she was at her husband's funeral. She has a history of hypertension for which she is taking Amlodipine  but no other significant past medical history.  Key Factors:  1. Age: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as 'broken heart syndrome') has a higher prevalence in postmenopausal women above the age of 50.  2. Gender: Women  especially post-menopausal  are more predisposed to this condition.  3. Recent emotional trauma: The death of her husband is a significant emotional stressor  which is a well-recognized trigger of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  4. Existing hypertension: Even though the pathophysiology of this disease is not completely understood  existing hypertension might increase the risk of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Other Factors That Could Be of Concern:  1. Body Mass Index (BMI): Women with higher BMI might be at higher risk  but the association is still not completely clear.  2. Lifestyle factors: Smoking  alcohol use  and other lifestyle factors may contribute to the development of this condition.   3. Socioeconomic factors: Higher levels of stress and lower socioeconomic status have been suggested as potential risk factors for takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Summary:  Based on her symptoms and a recent traumatic event  Mrs. X is a high-risk candidate for takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her existing hypertension and her demographic profile (post-menopausal  female) align with data suggesting a higher prevalence in women over age 50. Further investigations like ECG and cardiac biomarkers need to be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. She should be attended within the emergency department timely to rule out other causes of acute chest pain  such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,90,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Sex: Female - Age: Mid to late 70s - Ethnicity: Caucasian  - Lifestyle: Non-smoker  occasional drinker  sedentary lifestyle  - Occupation: Retired  - Marital status: Widow  - Family history: Has a brother with diagnosed coronary artery disease   Complaint: - Visiting the emergency department with intense chest pain and a feeling of breathlessness  described as feeling """"like a heart attack.""""   Medical History: - History of hypertension  controlled with medication - History of mild asthma - Regular mammograms with no abnormalities - No history of invasive procedures or surgeries - Regular health check-ups - Follows routine cardiac health checks  - Takes daily medication for hypertension   Recent Life Events: - Recently suffered a major emotional trauma with the passing of her only son  a week ago. She has been facing severe stress since then.  Physical Findings: - Vital signs: BP 150/90 mmHg  HR 110 bpm  RR 20/min  Temp 37º C  Oxygen saturation 95% on room air. - General: Is anxious and tearful but answers questions appropriately - Chest: Regular rhythm  No rubs or murmurs - Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. - Abdomen: Soft  non-distended  not tender. - Extremities: No edema   Lab Results: - Elevated cardiac enzyme levels  - Normal cholesterol level  Imaging: - Electrocardiogram shows prominent ST-segment elevation  - Coronary angiogram shows no blockage  - Left ventriculogram or an echocardiogram shows changes typical of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  with ballooning and weakening of the left ventricle.  Based on the above findings  the patient appears to have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome)  characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the heart muscles. This syndrome usually presents in postmenopausal women with a recent history of intense emotional or physical stress. The symptoms mimic a heart attack  however  no clogged arteries are found in most cases. It's essential the patient undergoes the necessary therapy and counseling to handle her emotional trauma."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,91,"Problem Representation:   Patient Profile:  Ms. J  a 68-year-old Caucasian widow  visits her primary care physician complaining of sudden chest pain and difficulty breathing. She denies smoking and drinking alcohol. She lives alone and does not have any children.   Past Medical History: Her past medical history is significant for hypertension or high blood pressure  which she has managed with antihypertensive medication for the past 10 years. Ms. J also has a history of clinical depression and anxiety disorder for which she has been under therapy and medication for the last 5 years. She had menopause at age 51.  Current Episode: Ms. J's symptoms started a few days after her pet dog  who she was very attached to  passed away unexpectedly. The chest pain and dyspnea were sudden and severe  similar to a """"heart attack"""". She has not experienced this type of chest pain before.  Contextual Factors: Ms. J has been experiencing increased stress and loneliness since the death of her dog. She has no family close by and has been mostly isolated in her home due to fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. She admits that her depression and anxiety have worsened since her dog's death.   Relevant Findings: Initial EKG conducted by her physician shows ST-segment elevation  raising concerns for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However  subsequent cardiac catheterization does not show any significant blockages that could cause an AMI. Her left ventricle appears to be enlarged and not contracting well at the apex but contracting well at the base  which is more consistent with a condition called Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome.""""  -Assumptions and Bias: It is important to monitor any unnecessary assumptions or bias. While Takotsubo cardiomyopathy tends to be more common in postmenopausal women with a significant emotional event  it can occur in men and younger individuals. Thorough assessment and testing should not be bypassed based on age or sex bias.  Patient's Understanding: Ms. J is initially shaken by the suggestion that she might have had a heart attack and worried about her future health. It is crucial to explain Takotsubo cardiomyopathy's transient nature  stress-related onset  and a generally good prognosis with appropriate support and treatment."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,92,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Demographics: 65-year-old Caucasian female - Occupation: Retired school teacher - Marital Status: Widowed - Lifestyle: Lives alone  non-smoker  moderate alcohol consumer  tries to maintain a somewhat active lifestyle by doing light exercises such as walking or simple home workouts  Presenting Issue:  Patient is presenting with acute chest pain  shortness of breath  irregular heartbeats  which began suddenly upon learning about the death of her close friend  which caused her significant emotional stress.  Past Medical History:  - No previous history of heart disease - Patient has been managing hypertension for the past 10 years - No known history of diabetes - Patient had a major depressive episode after her spouse's death 5 years back - Underwent menopause at the age of 52  Recent Events:  The patient has recently experienced highly stressful emotional events  including the sudden death of a long-time close friend.  Clinical Examination Findings:  Physical examination showed tachycardia and a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg. An ECG revealed ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion suggestive of myocardial injury.  Working Diagnosis:  Based on the symptomatology  history of recent emotional stress  lack of previous heart disease history  and initial findings from the ECG  a preliminary diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (or Broken Heart Syndrome) is suspected.  Note: This profile is based on general demographic and clinical characteristics observed in typical Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy patients  as reported in literature. Most of these patients are postmenopausal women aged 58-75 years  with a precipitating emotional or physical stress event. Most patients also experience acute chest pain and/or dyspnea  mimicking symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. The ECG findings and absence of obstructive coronary disease on angiography guide the clinician towards the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,93,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Elizabeth Johnson  Age: 71 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Location: Phoenix  Arizona  Demographics: Mrs. Johnson is a 71-year-old post-menopausal Caucasian female. American Heart Association indicates women  particularly older  post-menopausal ones  are more at risk for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Furthermore  Caucasians are disproportionately affected. She is a lifelong resident of Phoenix  Arizona.  Past Medical History:  - Chronic anxiety disorder): Studies suggest a link between emotional stress and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. - Recently lost her husband of 50 years: High levels of emotional stress and grief are often triggers for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. - Interstitial lung disease diagnosed 3 years ago.  - No history of coronary artery disease or heart failure  which differentiates her case from Ischemic Heart Disease. - Mild osteoporosis diagnosed 10 years ago. - Asthma since childhood. - Regular medications include albuterol  inhaled corticosteroids  and anxiolytics. - No history of smoking or alcohol use.   Problem Presentation: Mrs. Johnson presented with sudden and severe chest pain after learning of her sister's unexpected death. The pain was described as a heavy  squeezing chest pain  radiating to the left arm and jaw  symptoms often associated with acute coronary syndrome. Given her age and presentation  immediate attention was given to a probable heart condition. The onset of these symptoms following severe emotional trauma suggests the possibility of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as 'Broken Heart Syndrome.' Further diagnostic tests  such as EKG  blood work  echocardiogram  and possibly cardiac catheterization would be requested to examine this hypothesis. It will be particularly important to rule out myocardial infarction  which can present similarly. Furthermore  her chronic anxiety disorder exacerbates her risk for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  as does her status as a post-menopausal woman. Her interstitial lung disease may have systemic effects but is not directly implicated in her current presentation.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,94,Patient Identity: Ms. Clara  a 67-year-old Caucasian woman  Presenting Complaints: Complains of sudden severe chest pain and shortness of breath experienced after hearing about her son's unexpected accident.    Past Medical History: Previously managed for hypertension and high cholesterol levels. She has never smoked or consumed alcohol. She does not have any known allergies to medications. There is no previous history of heart diseases that run in her family. She is a widow and has been living alone. Clara has a history of chronic anxiety and stress disorders. She is a retired school teacher.   Representative Vital Signs at Presentation: Blood pressure reading at 145/95 mmHg  a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.  Clinical Presentation: Ms. Clara's symptoms began about six hours after she received distressing emotional news. ECG shows changes consistent with an anterior wall myocardial infarction but no occlusive coronary disease was found on angiogram. Troponin T levels are elevated.   Demographic and Social History: Ms. Clara is a pension recipient with a strong support network of friends and neighbors. She participates in a book club and occasionally volunteers at a local charity shop. She rarely exercises and tends to stay at home most of the time.   Problem Representation: A 67-year-old Caucasian woman who has a risk profile of hypertension and high cholesterol  along with chronic anxiety and stress disorders  presents with severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started after experiencing emotional stress  with ECG changes suggestive of anterior MI  but no evidence of occlusive coronary disease on angiography.   This patient presentation is consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  predominantly affects postmenopausal women and can mimic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. Factors such as her age  gender  the sudden onset of severe emotional distress  and hypertension could contribute significantly to her risk.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,95,Patient Profile:  1. Name:  Mrs. Jane Smith   2. Age:  65 years old   3. Sex:  Female   4. Ethnicity:  Caucasian   5. Occupation:  Retired School Teacher   6. Marital Status:  Widowed   7. Lifestyle:  Moderately active; Involved in volunteer work at a local library   Medical History:  1. Primary Diagnosis:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome)  2. Past Medical History:  Hypertension  Moderate Asthma  3. Drug History:  - Antihypertensive medication (Losartan) - Inhaler for Asthma (Salbutamol)  4. Allergies:  No known allergies   5. Social History:  Non-smoker  consumes alcohol in moderation   6. Family History:  Mother had a heart condition (Myocardial Infraction)  Presenting Complaints:  Mrs. Smith was brought to the hospital following a sudden episode of severe chest pain following intense emotional stress a week after the death of her beloved pet. She presents with symptoms mimicking a heart attack  which include shortness of breath  palpitations and chest pain.  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a temporary heart condition often triggered by stress  such as the death of a loved one. Patients with this condition may have sudden chest pain or think they're having a heart attack. In takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a part of the heart temporarily enlarges and doesn't pump well  while the rest of the heart functions normally or even with more forceful contractions.   Note: Most reported cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy occur in postmenopausal women and the condition is often preceded by a stressful emotional event. The cause of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not completely understood but it is thought that a surge of stress hormones  such as adrenaline  may be involved. The symptoms are similar to those of a heart attack and typically occur following an intense physical or emotional event. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,96,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 65 years old - Gender: Female - Race: Asian - Occupational Status: Retired  Past Medical History: - No previous history of heart disease - History of hypertension controlled with medication - No diabetes - Non-smoker - Regular moderate alcohol consumption - Regular physical activity  - No familial history of heart disease  Presenting Symptoms: - Acute onset of severe chest pain - Shortness of breath - Excessive fatigue  - Palpitation  Recent Life Events: - Lost spouse six months ago - Recent high levels of emotional stress  Objective Data: - EKG suggestive of ST-segment elevation - Echocardiography revealing left ventricular dysfunction - No coronary artery blockage seen in angiogram - Blood tests showing slightly elevated cardiac enzymes   This representation is based on typical demographic  clinical  and psychosocial characteristics of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (referred to as broken heart syndrome)  an acute heart condition that predominantly affects postmenopausal women  and is often triggered by severe emotional stress. It's important to note that while this is indicative of the average patient  there can be considerable variability in individual cases and thereby  the approach to diagnosis and management has to be patient-specific.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,97,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Sex: Female Age: 70 years old Race: Caucasian  Chief Complaint:  Sudden severe chest pain and shortness of breath.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient reports onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath after hearing of her husband's sudden death. The pain radiates to her left arm. She is agitated and panicking. Her blood pressure is elevated at 160/100 mmHg.   Medical History: She has a history of hypertension for which she takes Lisinopril. She has no known history of coronary artery disease  diabetes mellitus  or dyslipidemia.   Social History: She is a widow  recently bereaved. She has no history of cigarette smoking  alcohol  or illicit drug use. She is under a stressful situation due to sudden loss in the family.  Family History: No family history of heart disease.  Conclusion:  Considering the sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath  history of hypertension  and the recent stressful event (death of husband)  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced or broken-heart syndrome  is plausible. This condition more commonly affects postmenopausal women and can mimic symptoms of a heart attack. The patient should be admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment  including cardiac enzymes  EKG  and possibly an echocardiogram to visualize any potential transient left ventricular abnormalities characteristic of this condition. The patient may also benefit from anxiety management strategies or therapeutic interventions to help cope with her loss.   Note: This profile representation is based on epidemiological evidence that indicates takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more common in postmenopausal women  with a majority of cases triggered by severe emotional stress. The above representation is a fictional illustration and might not cover all possible presentation complexities of the condition  but provides a demographic approximation for better understanding.

Presenting Conditions    - The patient has recently dealt with a high-stress situation (the death of a loved one).    - The patient comes in with chest pain and shortness of breath  both acute symptoms mimicking a heart attack.    - EKG (electrocardiogram) shows abnormalities that do not correlate with typical findings seen in a heart attack.    - Troponin levels are mildly elevated  suggesting some heart muscle damage.    - An echo-cardiogram and/or cardiac MRI show a ‘ballooning’ of the left ventricle during contraction (systole).  This individual matches the typical demographic and circumstances of a patient with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  which is a temporary heart condition often brought on by stressful situations. The condition tends to occur more in post-menopausal women around the age of 67. Although they may show signs similar to a heart attack  diagnostic testing often shows no blocked arteries that typically cause myocardial infarctions. The condition usually recovers with appropriate medical management.   Bibliography: - Scantlebury DC  Prasad A. (2014). Diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,6,100,Patient Presentation:  Ms. G  an Asian woman of 73 years old  presents with acute onset of severe chest pain. She is a widow and had recently experienced a highly stressful life event: the death of her son. She has a long-standing history of hypertension  and there are no signs or family history of ischemic heart disease. She is a non-smoker with occasional alcohol use.   Problem Representation:  This patient's presentation  including her demographic characteristics and background  is typical of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress or broken heart syndrome. As per literature  this pathology is most common in postmenopausal women with a mean age of 67 years old  especially those enduring significant physical or emotional stress. The higher incidence in Asian people has also been documented.   Her acute chest pain is reminiscent of myocardial infarction  but her background suggests a different cause. Ischemic heart disease seems unlikely given her lack of personal or familial history  her sex  and her non-smoking status – factors which would otherwise increase her risk. Instead  her current stress level and history of hypertension  which are known risk factors  suggest takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Therefore  her age  ethnicity  sex  recent intense grief  and history of hypertension  together with symptoms mimicking heart attack - such as acute severe chest pain - create a patient profile that is highly suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,1,Title: A Case Report of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy following Emotional Stress in an Elderly Patient  Patient Demographics:   Mrs. A  a 75-year-old Caucasian female  was brought to the Emergency Department with severe chest pain radiating down her left arm. She lives independently and denies smoking  alcohol consumption  or use of recreational drugs. No known drug allergies have been reported.  Past Medical History:  She has a history of hypertension  for which she takes amlodipine 5mg daily  and type 2 diabetes for which she takes metformin 500mg twice daily. She has no known history of heart disease  myocardial infarction  or chest pain. There’s no family history of cardiac diseases. Mrs. A also has osteoarthritis and she manages the pain with paracetamol as needed.  Recent History:  Earlier in the day  Mrs. A received news of her younger brother's sudden death which led to a significant emotional stress. After the news  she started experiencing chest pain along with shortness of breath.  Physical Examination & Laboratory Details:  On examination  Mrs. A was anxious  with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/minute  pulse 95 bpm  and blood pressure 172/96 mmHg. Cardiac auscultation revealed regular rhythm with no murmur. Pulmonary auscultation showed clear bilateral fields.  An electrocardiogram revealed ST-segment elevation in leads II  aVL  V_4-6  and QT prolongation. Initial cardiac markers demonstrated elevated troponin level. The Creatine Kinase-MB (CK-MB) was within the normal range and there were no electrolyte disturbances.  Clinical Course:  Due to the high suspicion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)  Mrs. A was initially treated with Aspirin 300mg  Clopidogrel 300mg  and intravenous nitroglycerin. She was then transferred for an urgent coronary angiography  which surprisingly revealed normal coronary arteries. A subsequent echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Over the next few days  she was treated conservatively with bed rest and administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors)  beta-blockers  and anticoagulants for ventricular thrombus prevention. Informed consent was given by the patient for the intervention and the respective drug therapy was started.  Outcome:  Over the course of her 10-day hospital stay  her symptoms gradually improved and cardiac enzyme levels returned to normal. A follow-up echocardiogram before discharge showed significant resolution of ventricular dysfunction. The patient was discharged on the appropriate medications with a plan for outpatient follow-up with a cardiologist in 2 weeks.  Mrs. A represents a classic case of Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy (Stress-induced cardiomyopathy) characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction in the absence of obstructive coronary disease  typically triggered by acute emotional stress. Her case emphasizes the vital differential of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the evaluation of acute chest pain  particularly in post-menopausal women with recent emotional stress.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,2,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Female_Post Traumatic Event: A Case Report  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) or """"broken heart syndrome"""" is a transient heart condition often triggered by intense physical or emotional stress. Despite the reversible nature of the pathology  it can be fatal in the acute phase  particularly in the elderly.  Patient Information: The patient was a 67-year-old Caucasian female  married and retired. She is a former school teacher  nonsmoker  occasionally consumes alcohol  and has no known drug allergies. The patient experiences occasional stress and anxiety related to her recent retirement and relocation. The patient's past medical history was unremarkable  with no prior diagnosis of heart disease  diabetes  or hypertension. Her family history revealed no cardiovascular diseases.  Clinical Findings: The patient presented to our emergency department with acute onset severe chest pain in a characteristic sense of 'tightness'  radiating to the left arm and associated with shortness of breath. These symptoms had been presented for the past four hours  occurring approximately one hour following a car accident she had experienced. The initial EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  preliminarily suggesting an Anterior Myocardial Infarction (MI).  Timeline: Given the EKG findings and clinical symptoms  the patient was immediately treated with the standard acute MI protocol  including aspirin  clopidogrel and low molecular weight heparin. A cardiac catheterization was performed about two hours following her admission  which surprisingly showed no significant disease in the coronary arteries to explain the EKG findings. The left ventriculography  however  revealed apical ballooning  a characteristic finding of TTC.  Diagnostic Assessment: Following a normal cardiac catheterization  raised cardiac enzymes and apical ballooning  a diagnosis of TTC was made. B-type natriuretic peptide was also elevated. No other significant findings were observed in her routine blood tests. Echocardiography confirmed mid and apical hypokinesis of the left ventricle  with hyperkinesis of the basal segments.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was treated with supportive care and stress management. The standard MI protocol was continued as they are often used in the management of TTC.  Follow-up and Outcome: The patient was discharged after one week. On 3-month follow-up  the patient had fully recovered with complete resolution of the wall motion abnormalities and normalization of the B-type natriuretic peptide level. The patient was counseled about the importance of stress management and coping strategies to prevent recurrence  as TTC has been associated with a significant degree of psychological stress and psychiatric disorders.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the need for clinicians to consider TTC as a differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with chest pain and EKG changes mimicking an acute MI  particularly in the context of recent intense emotional or physical stress. Early recognition can lead to specific treatment and counseling  potentially preventing recurrent episodes.    Patient Perspective: The patient expressed relief upon the resolution of her symptoms and keenly embraced stress reduction techniques to prevent future TTC episodes."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,3,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Female: A Case Report  Introduction  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is a transient  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy characterized by acute onset of left ventricular apical ballooning (LVAB) mimicking myocardial infarction. This condition is more frequently reported among postmenopausal women. Here we present a case report of a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Case Presentation  A 65-year-old African American woman  a retired schoolteacher  with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hypothyroidism presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset chest pain  dyspnea  and palpitations. The patient reported the symptoms started suddenly while she was dealing with an intense family conflict at home.   She lived alone and had no history of tobacco  alcohol  or illicit drug use. Her medications included amlodipine for hypertension and levothyroxine for her hypothyroidism. She was not on any form of hormone replacement therapy. Her family history was significant for essential hypertension in her mother.  In the ED  her vital signs were stable  but ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Initial cardiac biomarkers showed troponin I levels were slightly elevated at 0.06 ng/ml (normal <0.03 ng/ml).   Given her symptomatology and ECG changes  she was immediately taken for cardiac catheterization under the impression of an acute ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction. The catheterization showed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease. However  left ventriculography demonstrated apical and mid ventricular hypokinesis with hyperkinesis of the basal segments  consistent with TTC  also known as """"apical ballooning syndrome.""""  The patient was admitted to the cardiology service for close observation and supportive care management. She was started on aspirin  beta-blocker (metoprolol)  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor  and a statin. Her chest pain and dyspnea gradually improved over the next 48 hours. Repeat ECG normalized and echocardiogram showed resolution of the previous wall motion abnormalities. She was discharged on the fifth hospital day with instructions to follow up in clinic.  Conclusion  This case illustrates the classic presentation of TTC in postmenopausal women  triggered by acute emotional stress  presented with symptoms simulating acute myocardial infarction  and diagnosed via cardiac catheterization. This diagnosis underscores the importance of considering TTC in the differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome  especially in postmenopausal women with emotional triggers."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,4,"Title: A Case Report of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-year-old African-American Woman   Patient Presentation:   A 68-year-old African-American woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden-onset  severe central chest pain radiating to the left arm. The patient reported the onset of chest pain occurred after receiving distressing news about the death of a close relative  approximately half an hour prior to her ED arrival. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus and is a non-smoker. The patient does not consume alcohol and has no known allergies.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient appeared anxious and acutely distressed. Vital signs were notable for tachycardia (heart rate of 105 beats per minute) and hypertension (blood pressure of 165/95 mmHg). Cardiovascular examination revealed regular rhythm with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. There were no signs of heart failure such as peripheral edema or elevated jugular venous pressure. Other system examinations were normal. An urgent EKG showed sinus tachycardia with ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  mimicking an acute myocardial infarction.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:   Given the presentation and EKG findings  initial working diagnosis was of an acute coronary syndrome. The patient was administrated aspirin  nitroglycerin  and anticoagulation  and was subsequently taken for urgent coronary angiography. Surprisingly  angiography showed no evidence of occlusive disease in the coronary arteries. The left ventriculogram showed the characteristic finding of apical ballooning with hyperkinesia of the basal wall  supporting the appreciated diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). The serum troponin level was mildly elevated. The patient's chest pain significantly improved after the initial treatment.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment:  The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) for monitoring and continued on aspirin  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor  and beta-blocker. Her chest pain completely resolved over the next 48 hours. Repeat echocardiogram performed one week later showed complete resolution of her previous wall motion abnormalities with an ejection fraction of 60%.  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken-heart syndrome""""  is characterized primarily by transient systolic dysfunction of the apical and/or mid segments of the left ventricle that mimics myocardial infarction  and it usually occurs after emotional or physical stress. It's more frequently observed in post-menopausal women  and it's essential to consider this diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain following a significant emotional stressor. In this case  significant emotional stress triggered the presentation of TTC in our patient.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the important role of emotional stress as a precipitating factor for TTC and the significance of considering TTC as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome symptoms  especially in older post-menopausal women with a recent history of significant emotional stress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,5,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman: A Case Report  Introduction:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also referred to as “broken heart syndrome ” is a temporary condition that imitates characteristics of a heart attack. It often occurs due to severe emotional or physiological stress.  Patient Information: A 63-year-old Caucasian female  a retired school teacher residing in Seattle  Washington traveled into the emergency department reporting an onset of severe chest pain and discomfort. She was a nonsmoker  with a BMI of 24. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension  controlled with lisinopril  and mild depression. She reported no history of illicit drug use  alcohol abuse  or a family history of cardiac diseases.  Clinical Findings: On examination  she was anxious and reported that the sudden chest pain had begun after she received news of her elder brother's sudden death. Her blood pressure was 145/95 mmHg  heart rate 95 bpm  and respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads and laboratory results showed elevated troponin I levels; however  lipid panel  electrolytes  and other metabolic markers were within normal ranges.  Diagnostic Assessment: Considering her risk factors  clinical conditions  ECG changes  and elevated Troponin I levels  initially acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was suspected  and she was shifted to the cardiac catheterization lab. Coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease. Left ventriculography demonstrated apical ballooning with preserved basal function  leading to a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was managed supportively in the acute phase  including beta-blockers (metoprolol) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (lisinopril)  which were determined to be sufficient considering her mild symptoms and the absence of dangerous arrhythmias or serious hemodynamic instability.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient was hospitalized for four days. On discharge  her symptoms had improved significantly. A follow-up Echocardiogram after one month revealed complete resolution of the previous wall motion abnormalities. The patient was counseled regarding stress management techniques and was referred for psychiatric consultation for her underlying depression.  Patient Perspective: “I was frightened when I got the chest pain. I had no idea that intense emotions could affect my heart in this manner. However  I am glad that it was not a heart attack  and I am getting help to manage my stress and depression.”  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the role of emotional stress leading to TCM. Despite not being as deadly as myocardial infarction  immediate identification and management of TCM are essential to prevent complications and hasten recovery.    Informed Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publishing this case report. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,6,"Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 70-year-old Female Patient  I. Patient Information and Demographics The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian female  a retired teacher  she resides in the urban area of San Francisco  California. She is a non-smoker  with moderate alcohol consumption and follows a balanced diet. The patient's body mass index (BMI) is within normal limits.  II. Past Medical History Her past medical history is suggestive of hypertension treated with lisinopril 10 mg daily  and hypothyroidism  managed on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily. There is no genetical predisposition to heart disease in her family  and she has no previous history of any coronaropathy or other significant cardiovascular condition. Three years prior to the current clinical scenario  the patient was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and is on metformin 500 mg twice daily.  III. Presenting Concerns The patient was brought to the emergency room expressing intense chest pain and difficulty breathing. The symptoms started abruptly while she was undergoing severe emotional distress due to the sudden death of her spouse. The patient described her chest pain as a pressure-like sensation  radiating to the left arm. Although  she did not express symptoms such as nausea  vomiting  or excessive sweating that are usually associated with a myocardial infarction.  IV. Clinical Findings Upon initial evaluation  the patient was tachycardic (heart rate 115 bpm)  her blood pressure was 165/95 mmHg  and respiratory rate was slightly elevated at 22 breaths per minute. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads suggestive of a possible anterior wall myocardial infarction.  V. Diagnostic Assessment Coronary angiography was performed  which showed normal coronary arteries without any obstructive lesion. However  ventriculogram showcased a typical """"apical ballooning"""" shape of the left ventricle  a characteristic presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  the patient's presentation was aligned with this diagnosis. Blood tests revealed elevated cardiac markers. Troponin I levels were increased (1.5 ng/mL  normal: <0.04 ng/mL) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were also elevated (600 pg/mL  normal: <100 pg/mL).  VI. Therapeutic Intervention The patient was managed conservatively with aspirin  beta-blockers (metoprolol)  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (lisinopril)  and diuretics. She was kept in the hospital under strict observation for one week. During this time  the patient's symptoms reduced and she clinically stabilized.  VII. Follow-up and Outcomes There was an improvement in the left ventricular function on the follow up echocardiogram 6 weeks after the episode  showing a significant reduction in her stress-induced cardiomyopathy. She was enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program and provided with psychological support to manage her emotional stress.  In conclusion  this case highlights the dramatic presentation and potential severity of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  especially in postmenopausal women with a history of psychological stress. Increased awareness and early recognition among clinicians can enable prompt and appropriate management  resulting in a favorable prognosis. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,7,Title: A Case Report of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 65-Year-Old Caucasian Female   Case Presentation:  The patient presented in this report is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  living in a suburban area with a medium socioeconomic status. Her primary language is English  she lives alone  and her chief complaint involved sudden onset severe chest pain. She presented at our emergency department (ED) after experiencing an acute intense emotional stress event - the sudden death of her pet.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. She had no known allergies  and her prescribed medications consisted of metformin  lisinopril  and a statin. She was a non-smoker  with moderate alcohol consumption at social gatherings  and her family history was non-contributory. She met her daily physical activity recommendations and had a well-balanced diet.   Clinical Findings:  During her ED visit  she was in apparent distress secondary to severe chest pain radiating to the left arm. Initial physical examination findings were within normal limits except for elevated blood pressure (170/90 mmHg) and tachycardia (110 bpm). An electrocardiogram (ECG) displayed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads V2-V4  and initial troponin I levels were elevated at 3.2 ng/mL (normal range is 0-0.04 ng/mL).   Diagnosis:  Based on her clinical presentation  an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was suspected initially  and she was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization lab. The coronary angiography  however  demonstrated no significant epicardial coronary artery disease to explain the ST elevations. An echocardiogram was then performed  which showed apical ballooning with basal hypercontractility  consistent with the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was managed with β-blockers (metoprolol)  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and diuretics  based on her presenting symptoms. She responded well to the treatment  and her clinical symptoms significantly improved over the next few days.  Outcome and Follow-Up:  Repeat echocardiography after two weeks showed normalization of the left ventricular function. She was provided with appropriate counselling to manage stress and anxiety. The patient was discharged with instructions for a follow-up office visit  continuation of her medications  and to seek immediate help in the case of the recurrence of symptoms.  Conclusion:   This case underscores the importance of considering TCM in differential diagnoses for patients  particularly postmenopausal women  presenting with symptoms mimicking acute coronary syndrome in the setting of a recent stressful life event. Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment are key for the excellent prognosis associated with TCM. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,8,Title: A case report of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 62-year-old female patient: Clinical Manifestations  Diagnostic Challenges  and Management  Introduction:   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or stress-induced cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is an increasingly recognized condition typically associated with severe emotional or physical stress and mimicking an acute coronary syndrome. Most common in post-menopausal women  the etiology remains largely unclear. This case study involves a 62 year-old Caucasian female with a history of hypertension and anxiety disorders  presenting with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Patient Information:  The patient  a 62-year-old  white  post-menopausal woman  living in the Chicago area  with a known history of hypertension controlled by beta-blockers and an anxiety disorder managed by psychotherapy and antidepressants  presented at the ER. She reported recent sudden emotional stress due to her husband's unexpected death. Three days post the incident  she began experiencing chest pain  similar to a heavy weight placed over her chest  along with shortness of breath.  Clinical Findings:   During the physical examination  patient's mental status was alert and coherent but displayed acute distress. Vital signs showed a high blood pressure of 165/90 mmHg and tachycardia with 115 beats per minute. ECG displayed ST-segments elevations in the precordial leads. Initial lab reports indicated elevated cardiac Troponin-I levels  a common marker associated with cardiac injury.  Timeline:  Upon admittance to the ER  the patient was immediately treated for suspected acute myocardial infarction. However  coronary angiography performed within 48 hours of admission failed to show significant stenosis or obstructions. Left ventriculography instead showed a unique pattern of apical ballooning with the basal segments of the left ventricle functioning normally – a classic presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Diagnostic Assessment:   The diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was established based on the Mayo Clinic criteria  i.e.  transient apical or mid-ventricular dysfunction  absence of coronary artery disease  and the onset of symptoms following a stressful event. Additionally  the patient's echocardiogram and cardiac MRI further supported the diagnosis  displaying transient left ventricular dysfunction.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was managed conservatively with continuation of her home drugs including beta-blockers for hypertension. She received aspirin  ACE inhibitors  and therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. She also received counseling and support for managing her recent emotional stress.   Follow-up and Outcome:   A follow-up echocardiogram 3 months later showed complete resolution of the left ventricular dysfunction  indicating a favorable prognosis typically associated with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She was also directed for regular psychological counseling.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in differential diagnosis for patients  specifically postmenopausal women  presenting with symptoms mimicking acute coronary syndrome  especially in the aftermath of significant emotional stress. Better recognition of this condition would lead to more appropriate  personalized patient management and avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,9,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman Following Significant Emotional Distress  Case Report:  Demographic Information:  Patient A is a 69-year-old African-American woman  living in a suburb of Atlanta  Georgia. A retired elementary school teacher  she lives alone  following the loss of her husband five years ago. Her husband's passing was her primary household stress  but she has also been dealing with the stress of managing her chronic high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient was brought to the Emergency Department when she developed sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  profuse sweating and nausea. The episode occurred within an hour of receiving news of her son's untimely death in a car accident.  Clinical Findings:  On arrival  the patient was conscious  but her blood pressure was elevated at 170/95 mmhg. She appeared anxious and in distress  with cardiac auscultation revealing tachycardia. An immediate electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation  and initial laboratory tests showed a modest elevation in cardiac enzymes.  Medical History:  The patient has a 15-year history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which is under reasonable control with metformin and a diet plan. She also has hypertension  for which she takes lisinopril. She has no history of smoking or any previous cardiac events.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Given the ECG changes and the clinical findings  she was initially suspected to be having an acute coronary syndrome  although her cardiovascular risk profile was only moderate. However  following an emergency coronary angiogram  there was no evidence of significant stenosis or occlusion to explain the changes. The left ventriculogram  on the other hand  showed apical ballooning with hypokinesis of the mid and apical segments  suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Therapeutic Intervention:  As a therapeutic measure  the patient was given beta-blockers to reduce stress on her heart and ACE inhibitors to manage her hypertension. She was also given aspirin  although not warfarin as she did not have any thrombus on echocardiogram. Her symptoms improved significantly after starting medication  and she was discharged from the hospital 5 days post-admission with close outpatient follow-up.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  At a 6-month follow-up  the patient reported no recurrence of chest pain. Repeat echocardiography at this time showed normalization of left ventricular function.  Conclusion:  The patient's symptoms  together with her clinical findings and examination results  led to the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  complicated by her existing hypertension and diabetes. Despite the initial severe presentation  the patient responded well to therapy and showed good recovery  underlining the importance of early detection and treatment in TCM. This case report highlights the potential implications of high emotional stress leading to significant cardiac events  such as TCM  in vulnerable individuals.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,10,Patient Information:  The patient is a 71-year-old Caucasian female who resides in an urban area. She is a retired school teacher and a widow with three adult children. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She is moderately active  non-smoker  and consumes alcohol socially.  Case Presentation:  The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath following the sudden death of her oldest son. She described her chest pain as a squeezing pressure that radiated down her left arm and up into her neck  coupled with a feeling of profound weakness. These symptoms began approximately two hours prior to her arrival at the emergency department.  Physical Examination & Diagnostic Assessment:  Upon physical examination  the patient appeared distressed and was diaphoretic. Her blood pressure was 170/100 mm Hg  heart rate was 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops  and her lung fields were clear to auscultation.  An ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V6  I  and aVL. The troponin level was significantly elevated at 4.8 ng/mL (normal < 0.04 ng/mL). Chest X-ray was normal with no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  The patient was admitted to the cardiac unit with a provisional diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction  and the coronary angiography was organized. Surprisingly  the coronary angiogram revealed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease.  A subsequent echocardiogram was performed  which showed left ventricular dyskinesis and apical ballooning  consistent with the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC). The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to be approximately 40%.  Treatment:  The patient was treated with supportive measures and standard heart failure medications  including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. She was also provided with psychological support  including referral for grief counseling due to the sudden loss of her son.  Outcome and Follow-up:  Within one month  she had made a full recovery with the resolution of her symptoms. Repeat echocardiogram showed the normalization of left ventricular ejection fraction and resolution of apical ballooning. The patient remained clinically stable during an 18-month follow-up period.  Learning Points:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often triggered by severe emotional stress  can mimic acute coronary syndrome. It is most commonly seen in postmenopausal women. Early recognition of this condition is essential to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and to ensure appropriate management. It generally carries a good prognosis with appropriate treatment and supportive measures.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,11,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Presenting in a Postmenopausal Caucasian Woman: A Case Report   Patient Information:   Ms. J  a 71-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department. She is a retired teacher  lives alone  and has a family history concerning cardiac diseases  notably a father deceased from myocardial infarction at 67.  Clinical Findings:  Ms. J presented with severe chest pain of sudden onset  described as a heaviness radiating to her left arm. Accompanying symptoms were shortness of breath and profuse sweating. At presentation  she was afebrile  and her vitals were BP- 140/90mmHg  pulse rate- 98bpm  respiratory rate - 22 breaths per minute  and SpO2- 96%.  History:  She is a non-smoker and consumes minimal alcohol. She reported no drug allergies. Ms. J has a medical history of Hypertension and Type II diabetes well controlled with metformin and losartan. Recently  she experienced the death of her only son  which had caused significant emotional stress.  Diagnostic Assessment:  12-lead ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. The initial troponin measurement was slightly elevated (0.08 ng/mL). Chest radiograph was normal. A transthoracic echocardiogram ((TTE)) showed systolic dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% and apical ballooning with basal hyper contractility  highly suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Subsequently  coronary angiography was performed  which revealed normal coronary arteries.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Ms. J was initially managed as acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) with oxygen  aspirin  and nitroglycerin undercardiology's consultation. Given her emotional stress history and the typical Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy echocardiography findings  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Therapy was continued with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ramipril) and a beta-blocker (metoprolol) for heart failure.  Follow-up and Outcomes:   Upon follow-up one month later  she reported a significant reduction in her symptoms. A repeat echocardiogram showed the ejection fraction had improved to 55%  indicating improved cardiac function. She continues to be on regular cardiology follow-up.  Patient Perspective:   Ms. J expressed relief about her symptoms and was counseled Importance of managing stress and prescribed regular sessions with a psychologist.  Conclusion:  This case report contributes to the existing literature that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  although rare  can mimic myocardial infarction's clinical scenario. It reiterates the importance of recognizing the disease promptly  especially in postmenopausal women with a history of recent significant emotional stress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,12,Title: A Case Report of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 69-Year-Old Female After Emotional Stress  Patient Overview: Mrs. Atsuko  a 69-year-old Japanese woman  presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of severe chest pain radiating towards her left shoulder  persistent for four hours. She lives in an urban area of Osaka  Japan and previously led an active health-conscious lifestyle. The patient reported no family history of heart abnormalities.  Medical History: Mrs. Atsuko  a retired school teacher  has a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension for the last ten years. She also suffers from osteoporosis but denies any history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or any other cardiac or associated diseases. She does not smoke  drinks socially and is moderately active. She also experienced recent emotional stress due to the sudden death of her husband one week prior.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  her temperature was noted to be 36.7C (98.0F)  heart rate 110 bpm and regular  respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute  blood pressure 150/90mmHg  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed distant heart sounds with no overt murmurs  rubs or gallops. Her lung exams were free of any crackles and rales.  Investigations: Blood investigations showed an elevated troponin I level indicating myocardial damage. Electrocardiogram (ECG) in the emergency room exhibited ST segment elevation suggestive of myocardial ischemia. Echocardiogram pointed out abnormal left ventricular (LV) systolic function  specifically  hypokinesis of the LV mid segments and apical segments  with hyperkinesis of the basilar segments  consistent with the Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management: The patient was initially managed as an Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)  receiving aspirin  clopidogrel  nitroglycerin  and statins. She underwent emergent coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries. However  left ventriculography demonstrated apical ballooning pattern with reduced ejection fraction  confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. As a part of her heart failure management  ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers were introduced  and diuretic therapy was initiated for her left ventricular dysfunction.    Outcome: This patient had an uneventful hospital course and was discharged on optimal medical therapy. She was given guidance on stress management strategies to reduce the risk of recurrence.  Discussion: This case highlights the atypical presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome'  whose clinical presentation often mimics ACS. Elderly females  notably post-menopausal women  are more susceptible to this condition  particularly following stressful events. Management often mirrors that of ACS until definitive diagnosis and is then adjusted accordingly  underscoring the importance of a rapid and accurate diagnosis. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,13,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy following Sudden Emotional Stress in a 65-year-old Woman: A Case Report  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome  is a kind of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy triggered by intense emotional or physical stress that results in severe but usually temporary left ventricular dysfunction.  Patient Information: We report a case of a 65-year-old Caucasian woman  retired school teacher  from the United states  with no significant past medical history or known family history of cardiovascular diseases. She was a non-smoker and had a moderate alcohol consumption.  Clinical Findings: The patient had presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe chest pain  perspiration and dyspnea that occurred after she received news regarding the sudden demise of her beloved younger sister. Vital signs on admission were; blood pressure 145/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  pulse oximetry of 96% on room air  and a body temperature of 37.2 °C. Physical examination was unremarkable except for displaying symptoms of acute distress.   Diagnostic Assessment: Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial and inferior leads  and the Troponin I level was significantly raised. Suspecting acute coronary syndrome  patient was immediately transferred to the catheterization laboratory. However  the coronary angiogram revealed no significant stenosis of the coronary arteries. Left ventriculography revealed a hyperkinetic basal segment with accompanying apical ballooning and hypokinesis  giving the left ventricle a shape resembling a 'takotsubo' - a type of pot with a round bottom and narrow neck used in Japan for catching octopus  hence the name. The findings confirmed the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the patient was conservatively managed.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on intravenous heparin and nitroglycerin which was followed by oral beta-blocker (metoprolol) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) therapies.   Follow-Up and Outcome: The patient's symptoms significantly improved over the next 48 hours. She no longer had any chest pain and her heart rate had normalized. An echocardiogram performed at 6-week follow-up revealed normalization of ventricular function. Her medications were further reviewed and optimized. The patient was advised regarding stress management and asked to come in for periodic cardiac evaluations.  Patient Perspective: The patient was thoroughly informed about her condition  the nature and purpose of the treatments  and her prognosis.   Conclusion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy presents similar to an acute myocardial infarction and can be triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. This case highlighted the significance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with acute chest pain  especially after a recent  intense emotional upset. Prompt recognition and accurate diagnosis can facilitate appropriate management and ensure a favorable prognosis.   Informed Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,14,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 72-Year-Old Caucasian Woman with a History of Depression & Generalized Anxiety Disorder: A Case Report  Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is a transient cardiac syndrome that shares features with acute coronary syndrome. We report a case of a Caucasian woman diagnosed with TTC following a severe anxiety episode.  Case Report:  This patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian woman residing in Oregon  USA. She is retired and lives alone. She has a past medical history significant for depression and generalized anxiety disorder for which she is under psychiatric treatment. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally and in moderation. She has a family history of cardiac disease  with her father passing away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 75.  The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. The chest pain was accompanied by dyspnea  excessive perspiration  and palpitations. The symptoms started suddenly during an intense  generalized anxiety attack. Her vital signs on presentation were blood pressure 170/90 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 94% on room air.  Lab results showed a mild elevation in cardiac troponin I levels (0.09 ng/mL) and an ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. She was started on the acute coronary syndrome protocol. However  coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries  ruling out acute coronary syndrome.  Subsequent echocardiography revealed apical ballooning with basal hypercontraction  which is typical of TTC. The left ventricular ejection fraction was remarkably reduced at 35% (normal value for women over 20 is 53-73%) with akinesis of the apical segments. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of TTC.   She was managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  Beta-blockers  and her psychiatric medication was optimized. The patient was discharged with follow-up appointments with cardiology and psychiatry scheduled. At her three-month follow-up visit  repeat echocardiography showed a normalized left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% with resolution of apical ballooning  and she reported significant improvement in anxiety levels with better emotional health status.  Discussion:  This case exemplifies the classic presentation of TTC and underlines the crucial role of extreme emotional stress as a triggering factor. It also highlights the need for a comprehensive cardiovascular risk factor assessment in patients presenting with chest pain  particularly among the elderly female population  who could have an atypical presentation or causes of chest pain like TTC.  Conclusion:  Clinicians should be aware of the potential for TTC particularly in post-menopausal females presenting with chest pain under exacerbation of psychological stress and in the presence of psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression. Confirmation of TTC diagnosis and subsequent management requires a multidisciplinary approach involving both cardiology and psychiatry.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,15,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy after Acute Emotional Distress in a Postmenopausal Woman: A Case Report  Introduction:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or 'broken-heart syndrome ' is a transient cardiac syndrome that mimics acute coronary syndrome. The condition generally affects older women and could lead to severe life-threatening complications if not accurately diagnosed and managed effectively.  Patient Information:  This case report describes Mrs. AB  a 68-year-old Caucasian woman  retired teacher  living in urban northern California. She had a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes which were well controlled with medication (Lisinopril 20 mg once daily and Metformin 500 mg twice daily  respectively). She was a non-smoker  had a moderate consumption of alcohol  and had a family history of ischemic heart disease.  Clinical findings:  Mrs. AB presented to the emergency department with acute onset of severe  sharp central chest pain radiating to her left arm  associated with shortness of breath that began after receiving distressing news about the unexpected death of her close friend. The chest pain was not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Additionally  she reported feelings of nausea and light-headedness.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Electrocardiography revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads and Troponin I level was elevated (2.3 ng/ml). A suspected diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome was made  based on her symptoms and ECG changes. She was started on low molecular weight heparin  aspirin  and clopidogrel. Subsequent coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries. Left ventricular angiography was performed due to the discrepancy between clinical and angiographic findings which revealed a classic 'apical ballooning' configuration  confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Therapeutic Intervention:   Mrs AB was managed with beta-blockers (metoprolol 50 mg twice daily)  ACE inhibitors (lisinopril 20 mg once daily)  and continued on her diabetes medication. She also received psychological support to manage her stress and grief.  Follow-up / Outcome:  Over the following week  her symptoms steadily improved and repeat echocardiogram after 2 months showed complete resolution of her previous left ventricular dysfunction.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of considering Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with chest pain  especially in the context of recent emotional stress. Prompt diagnosis and supportive management can lead to a favorable outcome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,16,Title: A Case Report of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-year.old Caucasian Woman Following Emotional Distress  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also called stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is a transient and reversible condition  typically triggered by severe physical or emotional stress. It occurs predominantly in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation often resembles acute myocardial infarction. This case highlights takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a 68-year-old Caucasian woman  presenting with symptoms mimicking a heart attack consequent to intense emotional distress.  Case Presentation: A 68-year-old Caucasian woman  Mrs. B  presented to the Emergency Department (ED) of our hospital with chest pain  shortness of breath  and nausea. The patient described the pain as sudden onset  sharp  and intense  located in the middle of the chest. She denied a history of smoking  alcohol or illicit drug use. It was further revealed that she had been under severe emotional stress following her husband's unexpected death three days prior.  Her past medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia and hypertension  controlled with atorvastatin and amlodipine. She had no known allergies and wasn't taking any other medications at the time. Her family history was significant for a paternal history of coronary artery disease.   Initial blood pressure was 155/90 mm Hg  heart rate was 112 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation was 91% on room air. Laboratory findings revealed mildly elevated troponin-I levels at 0.12 ng/ml. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads.   Given the symptoms  ECG changes  and elevated troponins  the initial working diagnosis was acute myocardial infarction  and hence  the patient was immediately taken for coronary angiography. Angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease  contradicting the initial diagnosis. Subsequent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated mid and apical segments hypokinesia with hypercontractile basal segments and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%  leading to the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   The patient was managed conservatively with aspirin  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and beta-blockers and under acute heart failure protocol. Psychiatric consultation was also availed for her grief and depression.   Follow-up TTE at six weeks post-discharge revealed complete resolution of the wall motion abnormalities  and her LVEF improved to 60%  reflecting the transient nature of this condition.  Conclusion: This case highlights takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy  often triggered by emotional stress. As described  this condition can closely resemble a heart attack and is often diagnosed following exclusion of myocardial infarction. In the context of increased emotional stress  post-menopausal age  and the presenting symptoms  clinicians should consider takotsubo cardiomyopathy in their differential diagnosis. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,17,"Title: An Unusual Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 55-Year-Old Hispanic Female  Patient Profile: The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic female of average body weight and height. She is a lifelong non-smoker with an occasional alcohol intake. Her occupation involves moderate levels of mental stress  a high-school teacher. She lives in a suburban environment  with no exposure to known environmental hazards.  Past Medical History: The patient has no prior history of cardiovascular disease  diabetes or hypertension. She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder six years prior to this event  for which she has been taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) regularly under the control of a psychiatrist. She also has controlled hypothyroidism for the last decade  managed with synthetic thyroxine supplementation.  Initial Presentation and Diagnosis: The patient was presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and dyspnea. The symptoms began abruptly  following an intense argument with her son. An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads  initially raising suspicion for an acute myocardial infarction. However  emergent coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease. Transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular apical ballooning  a classic sign of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC). The diagnosis was therefore made based on the Mayo Clinic criteria for TC.  Clinical Course and Treatment: The patient was managed conservatively  with ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and aspirin. She was closely monitored for complications  including arrhythmias  shock  and emboli. Her chest pain resolved within 48 hours  and repeat echocardiography after twelve days showed normalization of left ventricular function. She was discharged and referred for outpatient psychiatric follow-up.  Discussion: This case exemplifies the complexities of diagnosing TC  often called """"broken heart syndrome """" due to its similar presentation to acute myocardial infarction. The patient also demonstrated the established association between TC and emotional stress  although cases in perimenopausal or postmenopausal women are most common. This case is unique given that this patient developed TC without previously known cardiovascular conditions  which are typically common comorbidities in TC patients.  Learning Points/Conclusion: TC should be considered as a differential diagnosis in all patients  especially postmenopausal women  presenting with acute chest pain. While emotional stress is a trigger  clinicians should not overlook patients without a history of cardiac disease. Finally  the close monitoring and management of potential complications are crucial for a favorable outcome."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,18,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman Following a Stressful Event: A Case Report  1. Patient Information  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female. She is a retired school teacher with a history of hypertension  for which she is on medications (Losartan  100 mg daily). She lives alone and her husband had passed away a decade ago. There were no reports of any previous cardiac disease  diabetes mellitus  or any other chronic illnesses. She doesn’t smoke or consume any alcoholic beverages.  2. Clinical Findings  The patient was attended in the emergency department with symptoms of acute chest pain  profuse sweating  and breathlessness. The symptoms started within a couple of hours after she had learned about her elder son's death in a car accident. Experiencing significant distress  she felt acute chest discomfort radiating to her left arm simulating a heart attack. An immediate ECG was performed which reported ST-segment elevation in precordial leads.  3. Timeline  Given the symptoms and ECG findings  the patient was admitted to the Intensive Cardiac Care Unit (ICCU). Further investigations like the chest x-ray and echocardiography were also carried out. The chemistry analysis showed an increase in cardiac biomarkers (Troponin I levels were 5.2 ng/ml). Echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle  with a base to apex progressive reduction in the contractility. Coronary angiography  performed 48 hours after admission  showed no significant coronary artery stenosis.  4. Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was initially treated as a case of acute coronary syndrome and was given aspirin  clopidogrel  nitroglycerin  and a beta-blocker. Following the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  her medication was continued with the addition of ACE inhibitors. Her condition was frequently monitored with serial ECGs and echocardiograms.   5. Follow-up and Outcome  After a week  her symptoms significantly subsided. An echocardiogram conducted before discharge showed some recovery of the apical ballooning. She was discharged on the 10th day with medications and was advised for a regular cardio follow-up.   6. Patient Perspective  Overall  the patient was shocked by the diagnosis. She had initially believed that she was suffering from a heart attack. After learning about TTC and its link to emotional stress  she agreed to seek professional help to deal with her grief and heightened stress.   7. Conclusion  This case underscores the need to include TTC in the differential diagnoses for any postmenopausal woman presenting with chest pain  especially following a significant emotional stressor. Early recognition and proper management can prevent unnecessary invasive interventions and lead to improved patient outcomes.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,19,Title: Stress-Induced Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman: A Case Report  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy  usually occurs in postmenopausal women and is often precipitated by intense emotional or physical stress. Its major presenting symptoms mirror those of acute coronary syndrome  including chest pain and EKG changes  but without significant coronary artery obstruction. This report presents a case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a 68-year-old woman.  Patient information: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who presented to the emergency department with acute onset of severe chest pain after receiving news of her brother's unexpected death. She is a non-smoker  with a medical history significant for hypertension  well-controlled with lisinopril  and hypercholesterolemia  managed with atorvastatin. She had no past history of coronary artery disease  myocardial infarction or heart failure.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient appeared anxious with a blood pressure of 165/90 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 102 beats per minute. Initial EKG showed ST segment elevation in the anterior-lateral leads  suggesting possible acute myocardial infarction. However  her troponin levels were only slightly elevated. An emergency coronary angiogram revealed no significant occlusive lesions in her coronary arteries.  Timeline: The patient's symptoms started approximately 3 hours prior to her presentation to the ER. Within 24 hours of her admission  an echocardiogram was done which showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved basal function  a characteristic finding in takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnostic Assessment: Based on her symptoms  EKG findings  slightly elevated troponin levels  the absence of significant coronary artery disease on coronary angiogram and the echocardiographic findings  the patient was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initially treated with aspirin  clopidogrel  and heparin due to suspicion of acute coronary syndrome. After confirmation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  she was started on a beta-blocker (metoprolol) and the anticoagulant was stopped. Her angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for hypertension was continued.  Follow-up and Outcome: The patient showed significant symptom improvement within 72 hours of admission and was discharged on the fifth hospital day. A follow-up echocardiogram after 4 weeks demonstrated complete resolution of the left ventricular dysfunction. The patient was advised to continue with the beta-blocker and engage in stress management techniques.  Discussion: This case underscores the prevalence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in postmenopausal women under severe stress. Despite mimicking myocardial infarction  the key to diagnosing takotsubo cardiomyopathy is identifying the characteristic apical ballooning of the left ventricle in the absence of significant coronary artery disease. Early diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment can lead to complete recovery.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,20,Title: Acute Stress-Induced (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy in a 60-Year-Old Female Following Orthopedic Surgery  Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset chest pain  shortness of breath and nausea.  Demographics: The patient is a non-smoker  does not consume alcohol and has no known drug allergies. She lives alone in semi-urban Minnesota  United States and is an office worker by profession. The only significant past medical history includes controlled hypertension and osteoporosis.   Case Description: This patient was recently managed in hospital after undergoing total hip replacement surgery for severe osteoarthritis. She was discharged in stable conditions three days before the current presentation.   In the ED  she appeared diaphoretic and in distress. Initial vital signs observed were: BP 165/95mm Hg  pulse 110/min  respiratory rate 20/min  and temperature 98.6°F. Cardiac examination demonstrated regular rhythm  no murmurs or extra sounds. Lung sounds were clear to auscultation bilaterally.   The EKG showed minimal ST elevations in leads V1-V4 without reciprocal changes and no dynamic T-wave inversions. Blood test results showed elevation of cardiac enzymes: troponin level was 0.9 ng/mL (reference range <0.4 ng/mL).   The patient was diagnosed with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was immediately started on a standard regimen of dual antiplatelet therapy  high-intensity statin  and beta-blockers.   However  an emergently obtained coronary angiography revealed no evidence of significant obstruction or clot burden in the coronary arteries. Further left ventriculography showed apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basal segments  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Discussion:  The patient was extensively counseled about the diagnosis of TCM  known also as broken-heart syndrome  often triggered by acute emotional or physical stress. The recent surgery she underwent was considered as a plausible trigger for her TCM.   Management and Follow-up:  The patient was managed empathetically with supportive therapy  including a period of observation  angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and beta-blockers.   Her symptoms progressively improved over the course of a week  and she was discharged on low-dose aspirin  ACE inhibitor  beta-blocker  and statin  which helped to control her hypertension as well. At a 3 month follow-up  she reported no chest pain or shortness of breath. A repeat echocardiogram showed normalization of her left ventricular function without any wall motion abnormalities.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes that TCM should be considered in differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome  particularly in context with a recent stressful event. Prompt recognition and appropriate management of TCM can lead to a favorable outcome in these patients.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,21,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: Presentation and Management of a 68-year-old female subject  Introduction: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TC)  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a transient left ventricular dysfunction often triggered by acute emotional or physical stress. The condition presents similarly to Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) but without significant coronary lesions.  Case Presentation: The patient  a 68-year-old Caucasian woman  presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She lives in Midwest  is widowed  and retired from teaching. Relevant past medical history includes controlled hypertension  hypothyroidism  and anxiety. She denied smoking or alcohol consumption and has a negative family history of heart diseases. The symptoms seemed to have occurred following a distressing argument with her son.  Upon physical examination  the patient seemed anxious and in obvious respiratory distress. Heart rate was elevated at 115 bpm  blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  suggestive of a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).  The patient was immediately treated with aspirin  nitroglycerin and high flow oxygen  and she was rushed to the cath lab for urgent coronary angiography. Surprisingly  there was no evidence of significant coronary artery disease.  Meanwhile  her cardiac markers started to elevate; initial troponin I was 0.3 ng/mL (normal: < 0.04 ng/mL) which then peaked at 3.0 ng/mL. Interestingly  an echocardiogram demonstrated left ventricular apical ballooning with basal hypercontractility  findings suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Treatment & Follow-up: The patient was managed with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)  aspirin  and therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). She was also started on a short-term anxiolytic. With this treatment  her symptoms improved gradually  and the patient was discharged after 7 days.   At 1 month follow-up  a repeat echocardiogram demonstrated complete resolution of the left ventricular function and she returned to her completely independent baseline status.  Discussion: This case illustrates that TC can present exactly like ACS and highlights the associated increased prevalence in postmenopausal women and association with emotional stress. The absence of significant CAD on angiography  presence of emotional triggers  and characteristic wall motion abnormalities suggest Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Early recognition and appropriate management of this condition are pivotal to ensure a favorable outcome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,22,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Female: A Case Study  Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a transient and reversible condition characterized by acute left ventricular dysfunction  typically triggered by severe stress. While the exact mechanism remains unclear  it is often associated with excessive catecholamine release.   Demographics: The patient in this case report is a 68-year-old Caucasian female. She is a retired teacher  widowed  living with her daughter and grandchildren. She has no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. The patient spends her time gardening  reading  and assisting with her grandchildren's care. She appears well-groomed and denies any illicit substance usage.  Medical history: She has a past medical history of hypertension  controlled with medications (losartan and hydrochlorothiazide)  and hypothyroidism under control with levothyroxine. She had her last check-up 4 months ago  where her blood pressure and thyroid function tests were normal. Her surgical history includes hysterectomy for benign reasons at age 45. She has no known allergies.  Case presentation: The patient was brought to the emergency department (ED) with severe chest pain that began just after hearing the news about her brother's sudden death. She described pain as 'crushing' and 'squeezing ' radiating to her left arm  associated with shortness of breath. She denied any symptoms like fever  cough  or palpitations.  Investigations: Initial electrocardiogram demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  and troponin levels were significantly elevated  suggestive of myocardial ischemia. However  an emergency coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery stenosis. Left ventriculography depicted a typical apical ballooning with basal hypercontractility  a distinctive feature of TTC.  Management and outcome: The patient was admitted to the ICU under the impression of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She was managed with aspirin  beta-blockers (metoprolol)  and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril). She showed marked symptom improvement within 3 days  at which point she was transferred from the ICU to a regular bed. A repeat echocardiogram after ten days revealed normalization of left ventricular function. She was successfully discharged with outpatient cardiology follow-up.  Conclusion:  This report exemplifies the high prevalence of TTC in postmenopausal women  often triggered by extreme stress. Of significance  healthcare providers should be aware of the distinctive characteristics of this syndrome to differentiate it from acute coronary syndrome  since the management varies considerably. Further studies are needed to understand the pathophysiology and long-term prognosis of this intriguing medical condition.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,23,Title: An Atypical Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Middle-aged Male Patient   Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'  predominantly affects postmenopausal women. Reports of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in middle-aged males are relatively uncommon. This report documents the case of a 55-year-old male patient with no significant medical history who presented with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Case Description: The patient  Mr. X  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. He reported the onset of symptoms to be sudden  occurring after receiving emotionally distressing news. He was an occasional smoker but had quit five years ago. There was no history of alcohol or illicit drug use.  His past medical history was unremarkable  with no prior diagnosis of any cardiovascular diseases or other chronic ailments. The family history was also insignificant for any cardiovascular diseases.  On physical examination  the patient exhibited signs of acute distress. Vitals on presentation were as follows: blood pressure 135/90 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats/min  respiratory rate 18/min  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.  On 12 lead-EKG  it showed T wave inversions with ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. His laboratory results showed a significant increase in cardiac enzymes  including Troponin-I levels at 5.62 ng/mL (normal value <0.04 ng/mL) and Creatine kinase-MB at 53 ng/mL (normal value <7.2 ng/mL). Complete blood count  metabolic profile  liver  and kidney function tests were within normal limits.  An emergency coronary angiogram revealed no significant stenosis in the coronary arteries. A subsequent echocardiogram showed left ventricular apical ballooning with a reduced ejection fraction of 39%  suggesting the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  The patient was treated with a conservative approach  including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  β-blockers  and aspirin under intensive cardiac care. The patient showed a progressive improvement and was discharged under follow-up surveillance.    Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is typically associated with a sudden release of stress hormones induced by emotional or physical stress events. The patient’s symptoms were triggered by a stressful incident  emphasizing the 'emotional stress' aspect of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The fact that it occurred in a middle-aged male  usually less affected by this condition  makes this case atypical.   Conclusion: This case illustrates that while takotsubo cardiomyopathy primarily affects post-menopausal women  it can still occur in individuals who do not fit the typical patient profile. Physicians must consider takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome  regardless of the patient's gender or age.   Note: The patient's information is entirely fictional and created for the purpose of the case report; any resemblance to actual individuals would be coincidental.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,24,Title: An Uncommon Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Metastatic Breast Cancer Patient  Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female residing in Sydney  Australia. She is a retired school teacher  a non-smoker  and leads a moderately active lifestyle. The patient consumes alcohol occasionally and doesn't have a history of drug abuse.   Past Medical History: The patient has no known history of cardiovascular disease. However  she was diagnosed with estrogen receptor-positive  HER2-negative  Stage IIb breast cancer six years ago for which she underwent a mastectomy followed by chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. The patient has controlled hypertension for over a decade. She takes regular medications - tamoxifen for breast cancer  and ramipril for hypertension. No history of early-onset coronary artery disease is found in her family.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the Emergency Department with sudden severe chest pain  dizziness  and associated shortness of breath. The onset was while she was attending a family gathering  approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival at the hospital.   Clinical Findings: On examination  she was anxious  diaphoretic with heart rate 110 beats per minute  blood pressure 160/90 mmHg  temperature 37.1C  respiratory rate 24 breaths/minute  and saturation of 94% on room air. Her chest exam was unremarkable with no crackles or wheezes. No apparent breast masses were found on breast examination. Her cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia  but no murmurs or gallops were noted.   Investigations: An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads. Troponin levels were elevated at 11ng/mL(normal: less than 0.04ng/mL). A transthoracic echocardiogram suggested apical ballooning  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiogram showed no significant coronary artery disease.  Case Management: The patient was managed supportively with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and aspirin. She was transferred to the cardiac care unit for monitoring. After three days  her symptoms resolved  and repeat echocardiogram showed improvement in apical contractility.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  most often occurs in postmenopausal women and can be triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. Our patient's presentation is unusual because of her history of metastatic breast cancer. There are multiple case reports linking the use of chemotherapeutic agents like fluorouracil and epirubicin to takotsubo cardiomyopathy. However  the association of tamoxifen and takotsubo is scarcely reported.   Conclusion: The case highlights the need for clinicians to consider takotsubo cardiomyopathy in patients presenting with acute chest pain  especially in patients with a history of cancer and chemotherapy  even if they don't fall into the classic category of postmenopausal women under severe stress. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,25,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Female Following Emotional Distress: A Case Report  Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or ''broken heart syndrome """" is typically a transient cardiac syndrome presenting with chest pain  mimicking an acute myocardial infarction  but without coronary artery occlusion. This condition was first described in Japan and is characterized by transient apical ballooning of the left ventricle.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presenting to the emergency department (ED) with severe chest pain and shortness of breath which began suddenly while she was attending her husband's funeral. She lives independently and is a retired schoolteacher. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She reported no recent illnesses or travels. Her past medical history includes hypertension and hypothyroidism  for which she is on regular medication—losartan and levothyroxine  respectively. She has no history of cardiac disease or family history of heart diseases.  Examination highlighted an elevated blood pressure of 150/90mmHg and pulse rate of 110 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation identified a normal S1  S2 heart sound without the presence of murmurs. Chest radiograph was unremarkable  and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads indicating possible myocardial infarction.  However  her cardiac enzyme levels showed a slight elevation above normal reference range. She immediately underwent a coronary angiography assuming a diagnostic hypothesis of acute coronary syndrome. However  it revealed normal coronary arteries without any signs of atherosclerotic plaques or obstruction.  Nevertheless  the left ventriculography revealed a distinct pattern of apical ballooning with hyperkinesia of the basal walls  consistent with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient was then admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for close monitoring.  Upon further examination  her Troponin levels were moderately increased  which is consistent with the mild myocardial injury often seen in TCM. She was managed by continuing her antihypertensive treatment and initiating supportive therapy  including beta-blockers to reduce sympathetic overdrive. As she had significant emotional distress  she was referred to a psychologist who initiated coping methods and stress reduction techniques.  The follow-up echocardiogram after four weeks showed complete resolution of the left ventricular dysfunction  confirming the diagnosis of TCM. The patient showed improvement  and the chest pain resolved.  Conclusion:  This case highlights that TCM  though rare  should be considered in the differential diagnosis in post-menopausal women with chest pain especially in the setting of recent emotional stress. The characteristic feature of normal coronary angiogram with apical ballooning can help to differentiate this condition from acute myocardial infarction  thus avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures. It also underlines the importance of managing psychological distress in patients with TCM."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,26,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-year-old Asian Female Patient  **Patient Information**  Demographics: 68-year-old Asian female patient.  Main Complaint: Substernal chest pain  lasting for approximately 3 hours accompanied by dyspnea and palpitations.  History of Present Illness: The patient reports the onset of these symptoms following the sudden death of her spouse two weeks previously.  Past Medical History: The patient was previously diagnosed with hypertension  for which she is being managed with medication. She has no history of any cardiac or pulmonary disorders. The patient is a non-smoker  does not consume alcohol  and has no known history of recreational drug use. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease.  **Clinical Findings**  Physical examination: She appeared moderately distressed  primarily due to pain and dyspnea. Initial blood pressure reading was 160/100 mmHg  heart rate was 100 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation level was at 94%. Auscultation revealed regular heart rhythm without murmurs or rubs  and lungs were clear to auscultate.  Investigations: Laboratory results indicated significantly increased Troponin I levels at 5.2 ng/mL and elevated Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and Creatinine levels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  suggesting an acute coronary event. However  the coronary angiogram showed no significant occlusive disease.  Considering the patient's emotional trauma  her clinical presentation  ECG findings  and the absence of significant obstructive coronary disease on angiography  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  commonly known as """"broken-heart syndrome """" was made.  Echocardiography revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal walls  typical for TTC. Left ventricular ejection fraction was measured to be reduced at 35%.  **Therapeutic Intervention**  The patient was managed with supportive therapy including β-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics to relieve cardiac strain and ease symptoms. Psychiatrists were involved in dealing with the acute emotional stress she was under after the sudden loss of her spouse.  **Follow-up and Outcome**  On follow-up after 2 months  she appeared lot calmer and reported no chest pain or dyspnea at rest or on exertion. A repeat echocardiogram showed improvement in left ventricular function with resolved apical ballooning- ejection fraction measured at 60%  indicating normalization of cardiac function.  **Clinical Lesson**  This case presents a typical example of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in the context of emotional distress. The situation underscores the importance of considering such diagnosis in older patients with recent emotional stress presenting with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. Timely diagnosis can lead to appropriate management and reduction in complications associated with this reversible but serious cardiac condition.  **Patient Consent** Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report and accompanying images."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,27,Title: Case Report on a 67-year-old Caucasian Female with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Post Bereavement  Patient Information: The patient  referred to as Mrs. A for confidentiality reasons  is a 67-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher from Cincinnati Ohio. She presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of expressing severe chest discomfort  reported as resembling severe pressure spreading to her left arm. The patient reports that she has been in her usual health until her symptoms started ten days after the death of her spouse.  Past Medical History: Mrs. A is a non-smoker with a BMI of 30 and a past medical history of hypertension controlled with drugs (Losartan 50mg daily) but no known history of coronary artery disease  diabetes mellitus  or hyperlipidemia. Her family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases  with her father dying of a myocardial infarction at the age of 69.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  Mrs. A was slightly tachycardic (heart rate of 98 beats per minute) with a blood pressure of 150/95 mmHg. She had an unremarkable physical examination except for slight discomfort on palpation of the chest wall.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Electrocardiography (ECG) showed marked T-wave inversions in the anterior leads  but no ST-segment elevations. Troponin levels were slightly elevated at 0.12 mg/L (normal < 0.04 mg/L)  patient underwent cardiac catheterization to rule out acute coronary syndrome. Coronary angiography was performed  revealing no obstructive coronary artery disease.   Further assessment of the left ventricular function reported a reduced ejection fraction of 40% with apical akinesis and relatively preserved basal function - a feature frequently associated with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).   Therapeutic Intervention:  Mrs. A was managed initially as a case of suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with Aspirin  Clopidogrel  subcutaneous Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)  and high-dose statins (Atorvastatin 80mg). Following the catheterization results  the aspirin and clopidogrel were discontinued  while LMWH and statins were continued for VTE prophylaxis and LDL operations  respectively.   Given the diagnosis of TCM  it was decided to relieve the patient's emotional stress; and as such  a psychiatrist was involved in her care. Medications were optimized  including beta-blockers (Metoprolol) and ACE inhibitors (Ramipril).  Follow up and Outcomes: On follow-up after eight weeks  the patient reported a significant reduction in her symptoms  her ECG returned to baseline  and her ejection fraction had improved to 55% on repeat echocardiography. Her bereavement and stress levels were managed effectively with the help of psychological therapy.  Informed Consent: The patient had given her informed consent in compliance with the ethical principles of confidentiality and patient privacy.  Discussion: This case report showcases the relevance of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often misdiagnosed as acute coronary syndrome  particularly in post-menopausal women exposed to significant emotional stress. This case report highlights the importance of the psychosocial aspect in the management of such conditions and the effectiveness of supportive therapy for TCM recovery.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,28,Title: Late-Onset Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Caucasian Female: A Case Report  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as ‘broken heart syndrome’  is characterized by transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome  often mimicking acute myocardial infarction. It predominantly affects postmenopausal women and is typically triggered by severe emotional or physical stress.  Case Report:  Patient Information: A 68-year-old Caucasian female presented to the hospital emergency department with sudden onset chest pain radiating to the left arm  sweating  and difficulty breathing after hearing about her son's severe accident. She resides in a rural region in Idaho  is a former smoker  and has no previous history of psychiatric disorders.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,29,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-menopausal woman: A Case Report  Patient Information:  A 68-year-old African American woman presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and discomfort in her upper body.  Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Other than these two conditions  the patient has maintained a moderate lifestyle participating in routine exercise and balanced diet. She is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol. She underwent menopause at the age of 51  following which hypertension was diagnosed.  Present Condition and Symptoms: On admission  she was conscious but appeared anxious and complained of a severe crushing chest pain radiating to her left arm and neck which had started a couple of hours earlier while she was attending a funeral. She reported feeling extremely stressed emotionally during the event. She also reported occasional episodes of shortness of breath but denied having any fever  cough  or cold.   Physical Evaluation and Diagnostic Assessment: On physical examination  her blood pressure was recorded as 165/90 mmHg  and her heart rate was 112/minute. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads consistent with acute myocardial infarction. Initial lab reports showed elevated troponin levels. However  a subsequent coronary angiography did not reveal any significant coronary artery disease.  To evaluate the reason for her symptoms  left ventriculography was performed  which showed apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the base - a characteristic feature consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). An echocardiogram further confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was also evaluated for pheochromocytoma  given her persistent hypertension  but testing was negative.  Treatment: The patient was managed with supportive care along with standard heart failure medical therapies including β-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and diuretics. Her condition improved significantly over the course of her hospital stay.  Conclusion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" is more frequently observed in post-menopausal women and is often precipitated by intense emotional or physical stress. This case emphasizes the importance of considering TTC in the differential diagnosis of post-menopausal women presenting with features of acute coronary syndrome  especially in the setting of severe emotional stress  even with co-existing other cardiovascular risk factors."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,30,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-year-old Female Post Emotional Stress  Introduction:  This case report documents the presentation  diagnosis  treatment  and recovery of Mrs. G  a 68-year-old Caucasian female who developed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  commonly known as broken heart syndrome  following a significant emotional event.   Case Presentation:  Mrs. G  a retired teacher with a past medical history of controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  nausea  and shortness of breath. She reported that these symptoms developed suddenly soon after she received news of her son’s unexpected death.   Findings:  Physical examination revealed a distressed and anxious female  slightly obese with a BMI of 32. She was tachycardic  with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and mildly hypertensive with a blood pressure of 150/80mmHg. Lung examination was normal. Initial labs showed an elevated troponin level of 2.8ng/ml. Her electrocardiogram demonstrated ST segment elevation in the precordial leads.   Intervention:  A presumptive diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was made  and she was urgently transferred to the catheterization lab for coronary angiography. Surprisingly  the study revealed no significant coronary artery disease. Left ventriculography  however  showed apical ballooning with preserved basal function  a pattern consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography confirmed these findings with a reduced ejection fraction of 30%.  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) for further management. She was placed on an ACE inhibitor for heart failure  a beta-blocker for blood pressure and heart rate control  and a statin as secondary prevention  given her transiently raised troponins.  Outcome and Follow-up:  Emotional support was provided to Mrs. G  who found it comforting to understand her physical symptoms in the context of her profound grief. She was discharged home on day 5 with outpatient cardiology follow up scheduled. On her four-week follow-up visit  her symptoms had completely resolved. A repeat echocardiogram now demonstrated the ejection fraction had returned to normal (55%).  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  occurs most often in post-menopausal women and can be triggered by severe emotional stress. In Mrs. G’s case  the unexpected death of her son was identified as the likely trigger. Despite presentation similar to an acute coronary syndrome  coronary angiography is typically normal or near-normal in TTC making it a diagnosis of exclusion. Treatment focuses on the symptomatic management and addressing the root cause of stress  with nearly all patients experiencing a complete recovery.  While the pathophysiology of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not entirely clear  it is thought to involve an excessive surge of catecholamines that stun the myocardium leading to characteristic left ventricular apical ballooning. This case highlights the importance of considering TTC in older women who present with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome  especially in the context of emotional stressors.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,31,Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy In a 65-Year-Old African American Female  Introduction: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as 'broken heart syndrome ' is a transient left ventricular dysfunction often associated with emotional or physical stress. TCM predominantly affects post-menopausal women. This case report presents a 65-year-old African American female who developed TCM following the sudden loss of her husband.   Case Description:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American woman  widow  retired teacher  with a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with crushing chest pain associated with dyspnea and diaphoresis  which started acutely after hearing the news of her husband's sudden passing. She denied any history of tobacco or alcohol use.  On arrival  she was tachycardic (heart rate 110 beats/min) and hypertensive (blood pressure 170/105 mmHg). The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-elevation in precordial leads suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. Her troponin levels were elevated  confirming myocardial injury.  She was immediately moved to the catheterization lab for possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Surprisingly  coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries  ruling out coronary artery disease as the cause of her symptoms. Left ventriculography then revealed apical ballooning with preserved basal function  a classic finding observed in TCM.  The patient was managed with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. She responded well to the treatment  with resolution of her heart failure symptoms over a few days. A repeat echocardiogram after four weeks showed complete resolution of the wall motion abnormality. Repeated ECG also normalized  and troponin levels returned to normal limits.   Discussion:  This case illuminates the significant impact of emotional stress on cardiovascular health. TCM is more prevalent in postmenopausal women  particularly among Asians  but it can occur in any ethnic group  as in our patient. The patient's quick regression of symptoms was typical for TCM. It underlines the significance of considering TCM in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chest pain  especially when there is a recent history of severe emotional stress.  Conclusion:   Management of TCM is mainly supportive  with most patients exhibiting complete recovery. This case serves as a reminder for physicians to consider takotsubo cardiomyopathy in older women presenting with chest pain following emotional stress  irrespective of their race or ethnicity. The relationship between emotional stress and heart health should be explored further in future medical research.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,32,Title: Recurrent Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman: A Case Report  Patient Information: Mrs. X  a 68-year-old African-American widow  presented at the hospital with a 3-day history of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She is a retired school teacher who lives alone but is well engaged socially. Her BMI is within the normal range  with no history of smoking  alcohol consumption  or illicit drug use.   Medical History: Her past medical history is remarkable for a similar episode of chest pain three years ago  subsequent cardiology evaluation was suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC). She has been on regular follow-up with cardiology since then and is compliant with her daily aspirin 75mg  a low salt diet  and structured exercise. She has no history of hypertension  diabetes  or familial premature heart disease. She reached menopause at age 52 and never took hormone replacement therapy.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination on admission revealed tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute and blood pressure of 165/95mmHg. The cardiovascular exam showed an S4 gallop but no murmur or rub. Lungs were clear  and the rest of the examination was unremarkable. EKG showed ST-elevation in anterolateral leads indicating possible acute coronary syndrome.   Diagnostic Assessment: Hospital labs revealed elevated cardiac enzymes: Troponin T of 0.78ng/ml (normal range up to 0.1ng/ml). An echocardiogram showed left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning and preserved function at the base  suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiography ruled out the presence of coronary artery disease.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was managed with beta-blockers (Metoprolol 25 mg twice daily) to control the heart rate and blood pressure  mild sedation to alleviate her anxiety  and supportive care for her heart failure. Over 48 hours  her symptoms gradually improved  and repeat echocardiogram revealed normalized contractility.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Upon discharge  the patient was advised to have a follow-up every six months with the cardiology team. She was prescribed daily aspirin and metoprolol. The patient was also referred to the psychiatric team for stress management and coping strategies.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed relief at knowing that her condition was not a heart attack and committed to routine check-ups and medications.  Informed Consent: Verbal informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.  Concluding Remarks: This case is a vivid reminder that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  often related to intense physical or emotional stress  can recur in susceptible individuals. Ongoing follow up with cardiology and stress management strategies are important for such patients. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,33,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 67-year-old Female Post Bereavement: A Case Report   Case Presentation:  A 67-year-old African-American female patient presented to the emergency department with severe central chest pain radiating to the left arm  accompanied by dyspnea which began approximately 2 hours prior to her visit. The patient noted that her symptoms started suddenly while she was at her spouse's funeral. She has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol only on social occasions. She does not have any known allergies. There is a family history of coronary artery disease  though no known history of cardiomyopathy or other heart conditions.  The patient's vital signs upon presentation were as follows: Blood pressure 155/98 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Neurologically  the patient was alert and oriented.  Investigations:  ECG performed on arrival revealed ST segment elevation in anterior leads (V2-V4)  suggestive of anterior wall myocardial infarction. Lab results showed a slightly elevated Troponin-I level of 1.56 ng/mL(normal range <0.04 ng/mL). Complete blood count  renal function  liver function  electrolytes  and lipid profile were within normal ranges.  Due to the findings  the patient was taken to the catheterization lab for an emergent angiogram to rule out an acute coronary syndrome. Surprisingly  the coronary angiogram showed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease. Left ventriculography showed """"apical ballooning"""" with impairment of the left ventricular systolic function  suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was admitted to the cardiac care unit and started on heart failure management  including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics. Over the following few days  the patient's chest pain resolved and her cardiac enzymes normalized. An echocardiogram repeated one week later showed resolution of the apical hypokinesis  and near normalization of the left ventricular function.  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome  often presents like an acute coronary syndrome. It is more common in postmenopausal women and can be triggered by emotional stress  as in our patient who was recently bereaved. Despite her African-American descent (as takotsubo is more common in Caucasians)  her clinical presentation  investigative findings  and subsequent recovery fit well with the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Conclusion:  This case report serves as a reminder that patients presenting with acute chest pain with ECG changes suggestive of myocardial infarction may not always have coronary artery disease. It is important to consider takotsubo cardiomyopathy in such patients  particularly if there is a recent history of severe emotional stress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,34,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman with A History of Major Depressive Disorder  Patient Presentation: The patient was a 78-year-old Caucasian female  non-smoker  with a known past medical history of major depressive disorder  hypertension  and mild asthma. She was post-menopausal and had no known allergies.  Clinical Findings: The patient presented with sudden onset of chest pain radiating to the left arm  dyspnea  and excessive diaphoresis. She had no prior history of cardiovascular diseases. Her vital signs on presentation were: blood pressure: 150/90 mmHg  heart rate: 108 bpm  respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation: 94% on room air  and temperature: 98.6°F.   Diagnostic Assessment: Electrocardiography showed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4  consistent with the acute anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction. Subsequent cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography  however  showed no significant epicardial coronary artery disease to account for the ECG changes. An echocardiogram demonstrated apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basal segments  findings consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). Cardiac enzymes were elevated  (Troponin 1: 4.0 ng/ml; Creatine Kinase-MB: 35 U/L).  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initially managed as acute coronary syndrome; however  once the diagnosis of TTC was established  she was managed conservatively with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and short-term anticoagulation.   Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient’s acute symptoms resolved with the instituted treatment regimen. A follow-up echocardiogram  performed six weeks later  showed complete resolution of the previous wall motion abnormalities. The patient was then advised to continue on the beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor indefinitely.   Clinical Importance: This case underlines the importance of TTC as a differential diagnosis in post-menopausal women presenting with acute coronary syndrome-like symptoms. Furthermore  the association between major depressive disorder and TTC needs further investigation.  Patient Perspective: The onset of the condition was sudden and alarming to the patient due to the severe chest pain and dyspnea. Despite initial worry over a heart attack  the diagnosis of TTC provided some relief to the patient as this condition often resolves with appropriate treatment. The patient noted the need for better stress management and ways to cope with her depressive disorder given the potential link between stress/depression and TTC.   Informed Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the case report publication.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,35,Title: An Unusual Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-menopausal African American Female  Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year-old African American female  a retired school teacher  who lives alone. She is active and carries out most of her daily activities independently. The patient is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol moderately during social gatherings. The patient's family history includes type II diabetes mellitus (father) and breast cancer (mother).  Clinical Findings: The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset  severe chest pain  radiating to the jaw. The pain began while she was receiving news about the sudden demise of a close friend. Associated symptoms included shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and nausea.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She has been taking amlodipine 5mg once daily and atorvastatin 20mg once daily. The patient also has an established psychiatric history of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  for which she is being treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Otherwise  she has no documented history of coronary artery disease  stroke  or diabetes mellitus.  Diagnostic Assessment: On physical examination  her blood pressure was 170/100 mm Hg  heart rate 115/minute (regular rhythm)  respiratory rate 20/minute  and oxygen saturation 96% ambient air. The cardiovascular exam revealed no murmurs  rubs or gallops  and her chest was clear on auscultation.   Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  suggestive of an anterior wall myocardial infarction. The cardiac biomarkers demonstrated a moderately raised Troponin I level (1.8 ng/mL)  but normal Creatine Kinase-MB (CK-MB) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels.   Coronary angiography  performed under the impression of an acute myocardial infarction  unexpectedly displayed no obstructive coronary lesions. Left ventriculography  however  showed apical ballooning with preserved basal function consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was treated with aspirin  low molecular weight heparin  and beta-blockers. Her angiotensin receptor blocker was changed to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Her anxiety was managed with benzodiazepines in addition to her existing SSRIs.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  Upon follow-up at eight weeks  the patient was symptom-free. Echocardiographic evaluation showed complete reversal of left ventricular dysfunction.  Patient Perspective: The patient was grateful for the care received and was able to cope significantly better with her emotional stress with the help of enhanced psychiatric support.  Conclusion: This case report potentiates the fact that stress cardiomyopathy can mimic acute coronary syndrome. It is essential to have a high index of suspicion for TCM in post-menopausal women presenting with chest pain following emotional stress  even in the presence of risk factors for coronary artery disease. The management of TCM consists of treating the symptoms  anxiety management  and supportive care.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,36,"Title: A Case Report: An Episode of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman with History of Depression  Introduction:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken-heart syndrome """" is an acute and usually reversible left ventricular dysfunction characterized by apical ballooning. TCM has a strong male-to-female predominance  often affecting postmenopausal women. This case illustrates an acute episode of TCM in a 65-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of depression.  Case Report:  Patient Information:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher  living with her daughter following her husband's recent demise. The patient has a medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and chronic depression. She has been compliant with medication for these conditions. The patient does not have any history of drug or alcohol abuse  nor any family history of heart disease.  Clinical Findings:  The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  radiating to the left arm  and associated with nausea and dyspnea. The chest pain was sudden in onset and not associated with physical exertion. Her depression had worsened after her spouse’s death  and she reported feeling extreme emotional stress.   Diagnostic Assessment:  Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  raising suspicions of acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. Laboratory tests showed troponin I levels peaked at 2.5 ng/mL  and other serum cardiac markers were also elevated. However  the timely performed coronary angiogram did not reveal any significant coronary artery disease – a common finding in TCM  differentiating it from myocardial infarction.  An echo-cardiogram displayed apical akinesis with preservation of the basal segments  a typical feature of TCM. Consequently  upon confirming the absence of pheochromocytoma and myocarditis via additional tests  these assessment results led to the diagnosis of TCM.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was treated conservatively with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and aspirin. For her depression  an adjustment of her current antidepressant was made in consultation with a psychiatrist.  Follow-up and Outcome:  The patient's symptoms significantly improved over the following week  and a repeat echo-cardiogram performed after four weeks showed complete resolution of the apical ballooning. The patient was counseled regarding stress management and the importance of regular follow-ups for both her cardiac and depressive symptoms.  Discussion:  This case highlights the association of emotional stress and depression with TCM in postmenopausal women. Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential role of estrogen loss increasing susceptibility to TCM.  Patient Perspective:  The patient expressed gratitude for the diagnosis and successful treatment. She acknowledges the need for proper stress management in her daily routine and has committed to regular follow-ups with her healthcare providers to monitor her heart condition and mental health.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the role of psychological factors  such as severe emotional stress associated with depression  in the pathogenesis of TCM. Hence  it is necessary to consider the psychological wellbeing of patients presenting with chest pain  especially postmenopausal women and those with a history of mental health disorders."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,37,Title: A Case Report on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who was brought to the emergency ward after experiencing sudden-onset chest pain and shortness of breath. She resides in Cleveland  Ohio  and lives alone. She is a retired schoolteacher and a widowed mother of three adult children. She has no history of alcoholism or substance abuse. The patient is a non-smoker and does not have a history of drug use.  Past Medical History: On further attention to the patient's previous medical records  she has a history of controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. Her last recorded blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg  and her diabetes has been well-controlled with metformin. She has no history of cardiac diseases  but she reported an intensely distressing event a week ago - death of her oldest sibling. She has been on a regimen of antihypertensive and anti-diabetic medication. She has reported no significant surgical history. No known allergies were reported.  Presenting Complaints: The patient reported severe chest pain that suddenly appeared while she was at rest  approximately 2 hours before presenting to the hospital. The pain was described as heavy and crushing  located in the midstural region and radiating to the left arm. Accompanying symptoms included shortness of breath  nausea  profuse sweating  and a feeling of impending doom.  Physical Examination: On examination  her vitals were stable except for slight tachypnea and tachycardia. Her heart sounds were normal  with no murmurs or gallops heard. A mild peripheral edema was observed. Chest examination revealed minor crepitations at both lung bases.  Investigations and Diagnosis:: An ECG showed findings consistent with an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. A troponin I test was positive. However  subsequent coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease  making a diagnosis of myocardial infarction less likely. An echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with basal hypercontractility  suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC). Based on these findings  the patient was finally diagnosed with TC.  Management and Outcome: The patient was admitted to the cardiology unit for close observation. The following treatment options were employed: beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and aspirin. In 48 hours  the patient's chest pain had significantly subsided. An echocardiogram taken a week later showed an improvement in her left ventricular function. She was discharged with prescriptions for her pre-existing medical conditions and advised to undergo cardiac rehabilitation and psychological therapy for stress management.  This case underscores the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in differential diagnosis when encountering a patient presenting with chest pain and ECG changes suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome  especially in the context of recent emotional stress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,38,Title: A Case Report of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Female Following Acute Emotional Stress  Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as broken heart syndrome  is an acute  transient and non-ischemic heart disease commonly precipitated by acute emotional or physical stress. The syndrome is more prevalent in postmenopausal women and is characterized by an acute reversible left ventricular dysfunction.  Patient Information: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian female  Mrs. A  presenting severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She recently experienced an emotional shock after the sudden death of her spouse. She lives alone in a suburban area and has been retired for 7 years. She is a non-smoker and reports moderate alcohol use. According to her  she has no known allergies.  Clinical Findings: On admission  Mrs. A's blood pressure was 145/95 mmHg  and her heart rate was 110 beats per minute. Clinical symptoms include severe retrosternal chest pain  dyspnea  palpitations  and slight dizziness. Focused cardiovascular examination revealed a significantly decreased ejection fraction with apical ballooning  and no murmurs  rubs or gallops. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion. Serial cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated.  Diagnosis: With the abnormal cardiac findings  a coronary angiogram was carried out  revealing no significant coronary artery disease. Given the apical ballooning appearance on left ventriculography  absence of obstructive coronary disease  and new ECG abnormalities  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This diagnosis was further supported with the backdrop of recent acute emotional stress.  Therapeutic Interventions and Outcomes: Treatment was supportive  and involved the administration of standard heart failure medication including beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and diuretics. Aspirin and clopidogrel were also temporarily administered due to the initial suspicion of acute coronary syndrome. Over the course of 4 weeks  symptoms substantially alleviated. Follow-up echocardiography performed after 8 weeks demonstrated complete normalization of the patient's left ventricular function.  Conclusions: This case highlights the critical role of emotional stress in precipitating Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in susceptible individuals  particularly post-menopausal women. Health care professionals should remain aware of this condition  as it mimics acute coronary syndrome  yet carries a vastly different treatment regimen and prognosis. Thus  early recognition and appropriate management are quintessential to prevent potential complications and ensure patients’ recovery.  Patient's Perspective: Mrs. A expressed anxiety regarding her prognosis and potential for recurrence. She was comforted by the reversibility of the condition and comprehensive explanation of her situation. Plans to provide psychological and emotional support were made  considering the role of emotional stress in the onset of her condition. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,39,Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Female Following a Severe Emotional Stress Event   Patient Information:   A 68-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath.   Medical History:  She has a past medical history of controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed well with Lisinopril and Simvastatin  respectively. The patient is also a non-smoker with a BMI of 27.2 (indicating an overweight status)  although routine checkups have shown normal lipid profiles. She had been in her usual state of well-being until the sudden demise of her long-term partner  causing severe emotional distress.   Clinical Findings:   Upon arrival  the patient showed signs of severe anxiety and exhibited signs of acute respiratory distress. She demonstrated tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm and slightly elevated blood pressure of 150/90mm Hg. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior wall segments  which usually suggests the patient is experiencing a myocardial infarct.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Upon ruling out acute coronary syndrome (ACS) based on negative serial cardiac enzyme measurements  and a comprehensive coronary angiography that showed no significant coronary artery disease  the diagnosis was then directed towards takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM). An echocardiogram revealed typical apical ballooning with preserved basal function – a characteristic feature of TCM. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was slightly depressed at 40%. The sudden onset of symptoms following the significant emotional stressor  in conjunction with the described imaging findings  confirmed the diagnosis.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was treated with supportive management  including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics to manage potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary edema.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  An echocardiogram repeated after 2 months showed complete recovery of the left ventricular function with an improved ejection fraction  confirming the transient nature of the condition. The patient reported feeling significantly better and more emotionally stable at her post-discharge follow-ups.  Patient Perspective:  The patient relates her symptoms to the severe emotional upheaval she experienced following her partner's death. She expresses gratitude for the medical intervention and appreciates the value of psychological support during this difficult period.  Learning Points/Discussion:  This case illustrates that TCM  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'  is commonly triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. It is most often seen in post-menopausal women and can closely mimic an acute coronary syndrome. It highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in the appropriate clinical context to prevent unnecessary invasive procedures. Additionally  it underscores the interplay between emotional stress and critical physical conditions  signifying the importance of comprehensive management including emotional support. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,40,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Presenting as Acute Coronary Syndrome in a Post-Menopausal Woman: A Case Report  Background: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome ' is an acute transient myocardial condition characterized by severe left ventricular dysfunction  often mimicking an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It predominantly affects post-menopausal women.  Patient Information: The patient is a 72-year-old African-American female  currently living in urban Colorado. She is a retired schoolteacher  a widow for 10 years with three grown-up children  and lives alone. The patient does not smoke or consume alcohol but has a history of mild hypertension managed with daily hydrochlorothiazide.   Clinical Findings: The patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. She described the pain as similar to her “usual heartburn ” but significantly more severe.  Diagnostic Assessment: Initial EKG suggested ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)  with significant ST elevations in anterior leads. However  coronary angiography demonstrated non-obstructive coronary arteries. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed decreased left ventricular systolic function with apical ballooning  characteristic of TTC. Serum cardiac biomarkers were elevated with the peak troponin I level at 2.32 ng/mL.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initially managed as ACS  with aspirin  clopidogrel  and low-molecular-weight heparin  alongside with high-flow oxygen. After the diagnosis of TTC  the treatment was de-escalated to supportive care  including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for left ventricular dysfunction.  Follow-Up: The patient showed significant improvement over the subsequent week  with resolution of chest pain and improvement in dyspnea. A repeat TTE performed six weeks later showed complete recovery of the left ventricular function.  Conclusion: This case report emphasizes the fact that TTC  though less common  should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute onset chest pain in post-menopausal women  particularly in the context of emotional stress or trauma. The absence of significant coronary artery disease on angiography  in the presence of symptomatic severe left ventricular dysfunction  is highly suggestive of TTC.  Patient Perspective: """"I never thought that stress could have such a profound effect on my heart. I've learnt to appreciate the importance of managing stress and will make sure to incorporate relaxation techniques into my daily routine.""""   Informed Consent: The patient was apprised of the case report and gave consent for her clinical details to be shared for the broader medical community's learning."

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,42,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-year-old Caucasian Woman with No Significant Cardiovascular History  Introduction:   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also recognized as stress cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome  is a form of transient myocardial contractile dysfunction with symptoms mimicking acute myocardial infarction. Although it was initially identified in Japan  affecting predominantly postmenopausal women  it has now been reported worldwide. This case report presents a 68-year-old Caucasian woman with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Case Report:  A 68-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency department with acute onset of retrosternal chest pain radiating to left arm. The pain started shortly after learning about the death of a close family friend. Prior to this episode  she had no significant past medical history; specifically  no cardiac history or risk factors such as diabetes  hyperlipidemia  hypertension  or family history of premature heart disease. She is a non-smoker and maintains an active lifestyle.   On admission  her blood pressure was 135/85 mmHg  heart rate was 90 beats/min  and respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed slight ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Initial blood tests showed slightly raised troponin levels (0.7 ng/mL)  while complete blood count  renal function tests and electrolytes were within normal ranges.  She was initially treated as an acute coronary syndrome (ACS)  given the ECG changes and raised cardiac enzymes. However  coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease. A left ventriculogram demonstrated basal hypercontractility and apical ballooning  which are typical findings in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  She was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy triggered by severe emotional stress. The patient was managed conservatively with beta-blockers (metoprolol)  ACE inhibitors (lisinopril)  and aspirin. Her recovery was uneventful  and she was discharged in stable condition on five days later.  Follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram after 8 weeks revealed normal left ventricular function with no residual wall motion abnormalities  confirming recovery from the episode of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  particularly in postmenopausal women under high emotional stress  as symptoms and initial investigations closely mimic ACS. Fortunately  the prognosis is generally favorable with proper identification and management. However  clinicians must remain vigilant for potential complications  such as severe left ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias  which might require aggressive management. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,43,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Female Following Emotional Stress Event: A Case Report  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  mimics acute coronary syndrome. Despite its acute onset  it usually resolves within weeks to months and has a relatively favourable prognosis.  Case Description:  Demographic Information: A 67-year-old Caucasian female presented to our emergency department. She lived alone and had recently retired from her job as a school teacher.  Medical History: The patient's medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  which were controlled with medication  and she was otherwise healthy. She was a non-smoker and consumed alcohol infrequently. Family history revealed that her father had a heart attack in his late 60s.   Presenting Complaint: The patient reported acute onset severe chest pain associated with shortness of breath and sweating. The pain had started after she received news of a sudden death in her close family circle  indicating a prominent emotional stressful event.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient looked anxious with a blood pressure of 170/90 mmHg and a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Pertinent laboratory findings included marginally elevated troponin levels and an EKG showed ST segment elevation in leads V2-V6  suggestive of an anterior wall myocardial infarction.  Hospital Course: Due to the suspicious nature of the EKG finding  the patient was taken for emergent coronary angiography  which surprisingly showed no significant coronary artery disease. A left ventriculogram  however  showed ‘apical ballooning’ and a severely reduced ejection fraction of 30%  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment and Outcome: The patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit where she was treated with standard heart failure medications including beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and anticoagulants. After a week of hospital stay with regular cardiological follow-ups  she showed a marked drop in troponin levels and was discharged in stable condition with scheduled outpatient cardiology follow-up appointments. At her 1-month follow-up visit  an echocardiogram showed the patient's ejection fraction had improved to 55%.  Conclusion: This case highlights the need for healthcare practitioners to be aware of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as differential diagnosis in elderly women presenting with signs of acute coronary syndrome  particularly in the context of recent emotional stress. Early diagnosis and supportive treatment can lead to a full recovery.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,44,Title: A Case Report of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Female  Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as broken-heart syndrome  is a transient cardiac syndrome that mimics acute coronary syndrome and often occurs following extreme emotional or physical stress. Although men are also susceptible  TCM is predominantly identified in post-menopausal women  making up more than 80% of reported cases.  Case Presentation:  Patient Information: A 68-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our emergency department (ED) with acute onset of chest pain and dyspnea. She was a non-smoker and had a past medical history of hypertension  which was controlled by amlodipine.   Clinical Findings: Upon evaluation  the patient was tachycardic  with a heart rate of 112 beats per minute and hypertensive with a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg. The physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.   Diagnostic Assessment: Her initial Troponin T level was elevated at 0.15 ng/mL (<0.1)  and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in precordial leads. Subsequent coronary angiogram demonstrated clean coronary arteries without any obstruction. Echocardiogram revealed hypokinesis of the left ventricular (LV) apical and mid-segments  with hyperkinesis of the basal segments  consistent with a diagnosis of TCM.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) and initiated on a regimen of aspirin  a beta-blocker (metoprolol)  an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril) and a statin (simvastatin)  in consideration of the initial suspicion for myocardial infarction.  Follow Up and Outcomes: Angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers were gradually optimized over her hospital stay. Repeat echocardiogram at one-week showed complete resolution of wall motion abnormalities and normalization of left ventricular ejection fraction. Troponin T levels also normalized. At one-month follow-up  the patient remained symptom-free.  Discussion:  The case exemplifies a typical presentation of TCM  triggered by significant emotional stress - in this instance  the sudden death of her pet. TCM diagnosis is one of exclusion  requiring clean coronary arteries on angiogram and distinctive wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram  both present in our patient. Interestingly  despite being a non-ischemic pathology  TCM frequently presents with elevated Troponin T levels due to myocardial stunning  explaining the initial elevation in our case.  Conclusion:   This case underscores the importance of considering TCM in the differential diagnosis in post-menopausal women presenting with chest pain and ECG changes suggestive of acute coronary syndrome  particularly in the context of recent emotional stress. Early recognition and management of TCM is crucial to prevent complications  and ensure complete recovery.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,45,"Title: An Atypical Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Middle-aged Caucasian Female  INTRODUCTION:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  is typically a transient left ventricular dysfunction  often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. Most commonly found in postmenopausal women  this syndrome mimics the symptoms of acute myocardial infarction and can cause severe heart failure or life-threatening arrhythmias.  CASE PRESENTATION:  We present the case of a 52-year-old Caucasian female  Mrs. S  who presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and general weakness. The patient works as a manager in a stressful corporate environment. She reported that these symptoms started suddenly while involved in a heated argument at work. The patient denied any history of cardiac illness  however mentioned she had been managing chronic anxiety and depression  for which she was currently taking escitalopram and cognitive behavioral therapy. She was a nonsmoker  consumed alcohol moderately  and had no known drug allergies. Her family history was unremarkable for genetic disease or cardiovascular illness.  CLINICAL FINDINGS:  Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  elevated respiratory rate and normal body temperature. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Initial cardiac biomarkers  including troponin  were significantly elevated. However  emergent coronary angiography  conducted to rule out acute myocardial infarction  revealed no significant coronary artery disease.  Based on the angiogram findings  echocardiography was conducted next  which revealed akinesis of the mid-segment and apical region with hyperkinesia of the basal walls  a typical finding in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to be about 40 percent  lower than the normal range (55-70 percent).  MANAGEMENT:  Considering the stress-induced onset of symptoms  absence of significant coronary artery disease  and the echo findings  a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made. Conservative management was initiated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor  beta-blocker  and stress management techniques.  FOLLOW-UP AND OUTCOME:  Over the course of 6 months  with medication and stress management techniques  the patient reported a significant reduction in chest pain and shortness of breath. Her depression and anxiety were well-managed  reflecting a reduction in her overall stress. Repeat echocardiography at the 6-month follow-up showed complete recovery of left ventricular systolic function.  CONCLUSION:  This case highlights the importance of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a potential differential in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome  where there is a clear history of emotional or physical stress. Proper diagnosis  early recognition  and management can lead to good prognosis in most patients. Additionally  managing mental health condition may play an important role for preventing this condition."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,46,"Title: A Case Report of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-Year-Old Caucasian Female  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome  is cardiac syndrome characterized by the transient left ventricular dysfunction  prompted by severe emotional or physical stress. The pathology typically mimics myocardial infarction  but is distinct due to the lack of obstructive coronary disease.  Patient Demographics: Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  residing in a suburban region in the northeast United States. She is a retired school teacher  lives with her husband  and non-smoker with a BMI of 24. She has a past medical history significant for hypertension controlled with medication  and also a history of anxiety for which she sought occasional counseling but was not taking regular medication.  Case Presentation: The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain  distress  and shortness of breath following the unexpected death of a close friend. The pain was described as crushing  located in the middle of the chest  and no radiation was reported.   The ECG on admission showed T wave inversions in the anterior and inferior leads. Initial troponin was mildly elevated at 0.06 ng/mL  peaked at 0.22 ng/mL  and slowly declined. Emergency coronary angiography demonstrated no significant stenosis in the coronary arteries.  An echocardiogram showed left ventricular apical ballooning with a severely reduced ejection fraction of 30%  consistent with TTC. Ventriculogram further confirmed the typical apical ballooning of TTC  with the base of the heart contracting normally or excessively while the remainder of the heart was dilated creating the appearance of a """"tako-tsubo"""" or """"octopus pot"""".  Management and Outcome: The patient was treated with a beta-blocker (metoprolol)  angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril)  and aspirin. She was also provided with advice from a mental health professional considering the emotional stress she had been experiencing.   The patient had an uneventful hospital course and was discharged after five days with significant improvement in her symptoms. Follow-up echocardiogram at a month following the event demonstrated complete resolution of the left ventricular dysfunction.  Conclusion: Despite the non-existent physical strain  the emotional distress can lead to acute cardiac problems  due to a surge of stress hormones. Clinicians should be mindful of TTC when diagnosing and treating elderly women presenting with chest pain after recent severe emotional stress.  This case emphasizes the importance of considering TTC in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain in post-menopausal women  particularly in the context of recent severe emotional stress  and demonstrates the rapid recovery and excellent prognosis typically associated with TTC when it is correctly diagnosed and appropriately managed."

The patient has a past medical history of hypertension controlled with medication and no history of coronary artery disease or diabetes. Her BMI is within the normal range  she does not smoke  and she consumes alcohol moderately. She has been recently bereaved following the death of her husband three weeks ago.   Clinical Findings:  Her initial physical examination showed an elevated heart rate (tachycardia) at 115 beats per minute  and her blood pressure was 150/90 mm Hg. An EKG revealed ST-segment elevation  suggesting myocardial infarction. Troponin levels were markedly elevated. She was stabilized on aspirin  nitroglycerin  and beta-blockers. An emergency coronary angiogram to rule out a suspected heart attack revealed no significant blockages.   Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  At this point  the patient was suspected to have takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome)  given her recent intense episodes of stress following the bereavement. An echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis  demonstrating apical ballooning and wall motion abnormalities typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%. Other relevant laboratory findings were unremarkable  including a complete blood count  kidney function  liver function  and thyroid function.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment:  The patient received supportive care  including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics for her heart failure. She was also referred to a counselor to help with her bereavement  as it was seen as a potential trigger for her current condition.   Follow-Up and Outcomes:  The patient exhibited substantial improvement in her symptoms over the following week. A follow-up echocardiogram four weeks later demonstrated a return to normal left ventricular function and wall motion  confirming the transient nature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Psychological support was continued. The patient was recommended to remain on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for the prevention of future episodes.   Patient Perspective:   The patient expressed relief at her recovery and gratitude for her health care team  which addressed both her physical and emotional needs. She acknowledged the significant impact the death of her husband had on her physical condition and was keen to continue with the psychological support.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain  particularly in postmenopausal women presenting with severe stressor. Moreover  it emphasizes the role of psycho-social support in managing the condition effectively.

The patient appeared anxious  expressing that she experienced these symptoms shortly after she learned of the sudden death of her son.  Past Medical History:  The patient is a non-smoker  exercises regularly  and follows a balanced diet. She has a history of moderate hypertension  which is well-managed with medication including a Calcium Channel Blocker (Amlodipine 5mg once daily). She has no history of diabetes mellitus or hyperlipidemia. There is no positive history of illicit drug use or cardiac disease. She was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder twenty years ago and has been on Setraline 50mg daily. She has not undergone any surgical procedures.  Family History:  Her family history includes an older brother diagnosed with prostate cancer and a father who had a cerebrovascular accident (stroke) at the age of 78. There is no documented history of heart disease in her family.  Presenting Problem:  Upon examination  she was sweating  with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure measured 185/105 mmHg  and oxygen saturation at 93% in room air. Her chest examination was clear on auscultation  while there were no significant peripheral edema  clubbing  or cyanosis noted.  Investigations:  Her EKG revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads suggestive of Anterior Wall Myocardial Infarction (AWMI). However  her Troponin levels  although increased  were not consistent with the amount typical for myocardial damage in AWMI. A subsequent echocardiogram showed reduced left ventricular function with apical ballooning but no evidence of clot or vegetation. Coronary angiography revealed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease to substantiate an acute myocardial infarction.  Based on her presentation and the investigations  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Management and Outcome:  She was managed with optimal heart failure medications including Beta Blockers  ACE Inhibitors  along with her antianxiety medications. Her chest pain gradually subsided  and her blood pressure and oxygen levels normalized within a few days. Her repeat echocardiogram after 4 weeks showed complete recovery of the cardiac function.   Summary:  This case highlights TCM  marked by severe emotional stress leading to symptoms mimicking an acute myocardial infarction. TCM tends to occur predominantly in postmenopausal women with a history of a recent highly stressful event. It emphasizes the role of emotional health in cardiovascular diseases  warranting further research. It is crucial to manage such patients with appropriate heart failure medications and psychological support. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,49,"Title: An Unexpected Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman: A Case Report  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or apical ballooning syndrome  typically occurs in post-menopausal women following an intense stress event. This condition  although reversible  can lead to severe and life-threatening complications if not identified and managed early.  Case Presentation: A 68-year-old African-American woman with a past medical history of hypertension and osteoarthritis presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain. The pain was described as pressure-like  located in the center of the chest  radiating to the jaw  and associated with shortness of breath  nausea  and diaphoresis. The patient had been under significant stress due to the recent bereavement of her husband.  Upon initial evaluation  her vital signs were stable. Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  raising suspicion for an acute myocardial infarction. This was further supported by a rise in troponin levels upon lab testing. The patient was immediately put under nitroglycerin infusion and was given aspirin and clopidogrel  as per the hospital's acute chest pain protocol.  An urgent coronarography was performed  which surprisingly showed no coronary artery occlusion  instead  confirmed the presence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy with apical ballooning of the left ventricle. Left ventriculogram showed akinesis of the apex with hyperkinesis of the basal segments mimicking the shape of a Japanese octopus trap  or """"takotsubo"""".  The management plan was shifted  focusing on resolving the patient's chest pain  controlling her blood pressure and supportive care. She was monitored closely in the coronary care unit  and her beta-blocker dosage was increased. Over the course of a few days  her symptoms resolved  and repeat echocardiogram showed improvement of the left ventricular function.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a part of differential diagnoses in post-menopausal females presenting with chest pain and evidence of myocardial ischemia  especially in context of recent emotional stress. Early diagnosis and appropriate management can result in complete recovery  as was observed in this patient.  Keywords: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  Stress cardiomyopathy  Chest pain  Coronarography."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,50,Title: A Rare Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 62-year-old Caucasian Male  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome ' is a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in which there is a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium. While this condition is most often seen in postmenopausal women  we report a rare instance where the syndrome was observed in a Caucasian male.  Case Presentation: A 62-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain and dyspnea. The patient's past medical history was significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He was a non-smoker and led a generally sedentary lifestyle with a moderately balanced diet. The patient had recently lost his wife to cancer  and it was two weeks post her passing that he started experiencing symptoms.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient appeared anxious and in distress. He had a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Cardiac examination revealed mild tachycardia. There were no signs of heart failure. Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ST-segment elevation in precordial leads. Laboratory investigation showed mildly raised troponin levels but no evidence of major cardiac enzyme elevation.  Diagnosis: Given the patient’s clinical presentation and ECG changes  an initial working diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome was considered. However  coronary angiography did not show any significant obstructive coronary disease. Left ventriculogram displayed the typical 'apical ballooning' characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The absence of occlusive coronary disease and presence of apical ballooning helped form the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment and Outcome: The patient was treated conservatively with supportive therapy including beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and aspirin. Over a period of several weeks  the patient reported improvement in symptoms and follow-up echocardiograms demonstrated complete recovery of left ventricular function.  Discussion: The stress-induced cardiomyopathy  or takotsubo syndrome  is usually associated with emotional or physical stress. The patient's recent bereavement acted as the precipitating factor for his condition. Despite its immediate severe presentation  the prognosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally excellent  with most patients making a full recovery when provided appropriate supportive therapy.  Conclusions: Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy predominantly affects postmenopausal women  it should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of male patients presenting with acute chest pain  especially in the setting of recent severe emotional stress. Timely diagnosis and management can lead to a good prognosis for these patients.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,51,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-year-old Caucasian Female Following the Death of a Loved-One: A Case Report  Abstract:  We present an uncommon case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress-induced or """"broken heart"""" syndrome  in a 68-year-old Caucasian woman  triggered by the death of a loved-one. Our case illustrates the characteristic features  clinical presentation  diagnostic criteria and management strategies for TTC.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female with a medical history that includes well-controlled hypertension  mild osteoarthritis and a history of depression but has no previously diagnosed heart conditions. She presented with typical symptoms of acute myocardial infarction  which occurred one day after the death of her son.  Subjective:  The patient attended the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  shortness of breath  and excessive sweating — all of which initiated about 6 hours before presentation.   Objective:  The patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. Initial vitals provided evidence of moderate tachycardia (heartrate: 110 beats/min) and slightly elevated blood pressure (140/90 mmHg). Electrocardiogram (ECG) examination revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads and T-wave inversions. Laboratory findings identified a transient increase in cardiac troponin levels. However  a coronary angiogram found normal coronary arteries ruling out a typical myocardial infarction.  Assessment:  The patient's history  clinical presentation  and diagnostic tests were consistent with TTC and not a typical myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram reinforced the diagnosis  evidencing apical ballooning and reduced contraction of the left ventricle — characteristics of TTC. The precipitating factor  in this case  was considered to be the emotional stress caused by the loss of her son.  Plan:  The patient was managed conservatively with aspirin  beta-blockers  and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. She was kept under observation in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) for three days during acute management and followed up with after three weeks for further echocardiographic assessment and therapy adjustment. Regular psychiatric follow-ups were also arranged for grief counseling and addressing her history of depression.  Conclusion:  TTC is a transient heart condition often precipitated by intense emotional or physical stress. Early recognition and appropriate supportive management can assure a promising prognosis. This case demonstrates that profound emotional distress  such as bereavement  can result in TTC  even in individuals with no prior history of cardiac disease. Therefore  in patients presenting with cardiac symptoms following severe stress  TTC should be a differential diagnosis."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,52,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman Following Sudden Emotional Stress   Case Report:  Patient Information:   The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher  living in Austin  Texas USA. She is a widow and lives alone. She has been a non-smoker for over 20 years  and a light social drinker. She has no history of substance abuse.   Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension which has been well-managed using medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily). She is also on Levothyroxine  75 mcg daily for a longstanding hypothyroid issue. There is no known allergy to any medication. She has no history of heart disease nor any immediate family history of cardiac disorders. She had an uneventful menopause transition at age 52.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath that had started suddenly about an hour earlier when she received news of her brother's sudden death. The pain was described as a sharp  severe central chest pain that radiated to her jaw and left arm. She also reported feeling excessively fatigued  sweaty  and nauseated.   Clinical Findings:   Upon presentation  the patient’s blood pressure was 155/95 mmHg  pulse rate 110 beats/min  and her oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. The physical examination was unremarkable except for the cardiac examination which revealed tachycardia with no murmurs. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST elevation in the anterior leads  raising suspicion of anterior wall myocardial infarction.   Diagnostic Assessment:  Blood tests showed elevated troponin levels. However  subsequent coronary angiography depicted no significant coronary artery disease to account for the suspected myocardial infarction. Left ventriculogram showed apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesis  typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).   Management:  The patient was managed conservatively with bed rest  aspirin  beta-blockers  and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE) in conjunction with her pre-existing medication. She was closely monitored in the hospital for complications such as heart failure  arrhythmia  and thrombo-embolism.   Outcome and Follow-up:   The patient responded well to the treatment  with a gradual resolution of her symptoms over the course of a week. Follow-up echocardiogram at 6 weeks showed complete resolution of the ventricular dysfunction characteristic of TCM. She was connected with a grief counselor and recommended regular follow-up with her primary care physician and cardiologist.   Conclusion:  This case reinforces the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis for acute coronary syndrome  particularly in post-menopausal women with sudden emotional stress. Early recognition and appropriate management can result in good prognosis for these patients. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,53,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-Year-Old Asian Female Following Emotional Stress: A Case Report  Case Presentation:  A 68-year-old Asian female presented to the emergency department with chest pains  palpitations  and shortness of breath following the sudden death of her spouse. Examination revealed moderate distress  pulse rate of 120 beats per minute  blood pressure of 134/80 mmHg  respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Medical history showed no evidence of cardiovascular diseases or risk factors like hypertension  diabetes  or hyperlipidemia. She had no history of smoking or alcohol consumption.  Clinical Findings:  Cardiac enzymes: Troponin-I was significantly elevated at 2.5 ng/ml (normal: 0-0.04 ng/ml) Electrocardiogram (ECG): ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion were found in precordial leads V2-V6 and lateral limb leads I and aVL which was suggestive for ischemic heart disease. Chest radiograph: No signs of congestive heart failure or lung diseases. Blood laboratories: Otherwise unremarkable with normal lipids  liver  renal functions and complete blood cell count.  Diagnosis and treatment:  A presumptive diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome was made based on the clinical presentation and admitted to the coronary care unit. During the second day  a coronary angiography was performed which showed no significant obstructive lesions. A left ventriculogram revealed a typical apical ballooning pattern with a hyper-contractile base  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as broken heart syndrome.  She was commenced on a low dose of metoprolol (beta-blocker)  ramipril (ACE-inhibitor)  and a low-dose of aspirin. The patient was also advised for bereavement counselling due to the suspected emotional trigger.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  Follow-up echocardiography  performed 8 weeks later  demonstrated the resolution of the wall motion abnormality  with an estimated ejection fraction of 55-60%  suggesting substantial recovery.  Discussion:  This case report highlights an uncommon cardiomyopathy that is predominantly found in post-menopausal women often triggered by severe emotional stress. The clinical presentation often mimics an acute coronary syndrome but is devoid of any significant coronary artery disease. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by echocardiography or angiography demonstrating a typical pattern of ventricular weakening. Management is supportive with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and address the trigger event if possible.  Conclusion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be considered in differential diagnosis in patients  especially in post-menopausal women  presenting with cardiac-sounding chest pain after significant emotional stress  in the absence of significant coronary artery disease. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,54,Title: A Case Report on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman   Abstract: This case report presents the development and management of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) in a 70-year-old female. We aim to discuss her diagnosis  treatment  and recovery process given her unique case history  which dwells on the psychological stress aspect of TC  particularly after significant emotional stress events.  Case Presentation: Mrs. X is a 70-year-old Caucasian woman  non-smoker  with a medical history suggestive of hypertension and well-managed Type II diabetes mellitus. Five days after the sudden death of her dear husband  Mrs. X presented at the Emergency Department with severe chest pain  simulating an acute myocardial infarction.  Evaluation & Diagnosis: On examination  she had a high blood pressure of 170/80 mmHg and a tachycardia of 108 bpm. Initial ECG showed ST segment elevation in the anterior leads suggestive of an anterior wall myocardial infarction. The patient was initially treated based on the ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) protocol. Troponin levels were mildly elevated. However  coronary angiography revealed non-diseased coronary arteries inconsistent with the initial working diagnosis of STEMI. Conversely  left ventriculography showed apical ballooning with hyperdynamic basal segments  fulfilling the Mayo Clinic criteria for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management & Outcome: Mrs. X was managed conservatively with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and aspirin. She was admitted to the cardiac care unit and closely monitored. Over the next three days  her symptoms improved markedly also as she received supportive therapy for grieving. Her ejection fraction improved from 35% to 60% within two weeks. She was discharged home with follow-up appointments and extensive counseling about lifestyle modifications and stress management.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome often triggered by acute emotional or physical stress. This case illustrates the impact of significant psychological stress  such as bereavement  as a trigger for TC. Special attention should be given to elderly post-menopausal women who have experienced severe emotional stress as they are particularly vulnerable to this condition.  Conclusions: Prompt recognition and diagnosis of TC are essential due to its similar presentation to acute coronary syndromes. A proper understanding of the pathophysiology and management of this disease can aid in optimizing patient outcomes. Moreover  healthcare providers should not overlook the role of psychological stressors in cardiovascular diseases  particularly in high-risk populations  such as older post-menopausal women.

Often misdiagnosed as acute coronary syndrome  it has a female predominance  commonly noted in post-menopausal women.  Patient Information: The subject is a 65-year-old African-American woman  living in an urban setting  retired from her job as a schoolteacher. She lives with her eldest daughter and her grandchildren. She is a widower  with her husband passing away a year ago. She has no known drug allergies.  Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension for which she is on amlodipine. She is slightly overweight with a BMI of 27  non-smoker  and infrequent alcohol drinker. She maintains a moderately active lifestyle aided by frequent walks and gardening work. The patient's family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with her father having suffered from myocardial infarction at age 59.  Presenting Complaints: The patient was brought to the emergency department with intense chest pain and shortness of breath. She reported that she had experienced an intense emotional stressor earlier in the day when she entered into a heated argument with her daughter. The pain  described as """"sharp and heavy""""  was located in the center of her chest.  Clinical Findings: The patient's vital signs revealed a heart rate of 110 BPM and blood pressure of 180/90 mmHg. An EKG showed ST-segment elevation. Lab results revealed elevated troponin I levels  but angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease that could possibly induce the infarction. The left ventricular angiogram  however  revealed typical apical ballooning  leading to suspected diagnosis of TCM.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was admitted to the hospital's cardiac care unit and treated with beta-blockers  aspirin  and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The patient was closely monitored with consecutive echocardiograms to track cardiac function.  Follow-Up and Outcome: On the follow-up visit 2 months later  the patient's symptoms resolved completely  her EKG was normalized  and an echocardiogram showed improved contractility with no residual wall motion abnormalities — confirming the diagnosis of TCM. She was educated about stress management and coping strategies  considering the recurrence rate of TCM.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of considering TCM as a differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with chest pain  especially in the context of emotional stress.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,56,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman: A Case Report  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome""""  is a transient cardiac syndrome characterized by the left ventricular dysfunction  mimicking myocardial infarction. Although it's considered less common  it predominantly affects postmenopausal women.  Case Presentation: A 68-year-old Asian woman presented to the emergency department with sharp chest pain  radiating to the left shoulder. She described the pain as sudden in onset and constant. Her medical history was significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a high level of psychosocial stress due to the recent loss of her spouse.  Past Medical History: The patient has a 10-year history of hypertension controlled with losartan and a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia managed with atorvastatin. She has no prior history of cardiovascular disease  smoking  or alcohol use. She has no known drug allergies. Her only surgical history includes a hysterectomy for benign disease 20 years ago.  Investigations: Upon examination  the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. Vital signs included blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg  a heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Physical examination was largely unremarkable except for mild tachycardia.   An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Initial troponin level was elevated at 2.5 ng/ml. Complete blood count  comprehensive metabolic panel  and coagulation profile were within normal ranges. Given her ECG findings and troponin level  a working diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was made.  Management and Outcome: The patient was urgently referred for coronary angiography due to the presumptive diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. However  her evaluation did not reveal obstructive coronary artery disease. Left ventricular angiography demonstrated apical ballooning with basal hypercontractility consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   She was started on carvedilol and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors along with her other medications. After a week of hospitalization  the patient was discharged in a stable condition. At her 1-month follow-up visit  she had no recurrent chest pain and an ECG showed the resolution of prior changes. Repeat echocardiogram at that time showed complete resolution of the left ventricular dysfunction  further confirming the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Discussion: This case highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome  particularly in the context of recent emotional stress. Increased awareness and recognition of this condition are essential for appropriate management and prevention of potential complications.   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy despite being a reversible condition may have serious acute phase complications that might require supportive treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment is crucial in ensuring a swift recovery. Furthermore  addressing any underlying emotional or psychological stressors can aid in the management and prevention of this condition.   This case aligns with previous evidence suggesting that takotsubo cardiomyopathy is predominantly observed in postmenopausal women under high emotional stress. Thus  this demographic should be specifically screened for symptoms compatible with this condition. The inclusion of psychosocial evaluation alongside medical approaches is recommended to provide optimal care for these patients."

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,58,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman  Introduction Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or stress cardiomyopathy is a transient left ventricular dysfunction often triggered by acute emotional or physical stress. This condition mimics the symptoms of acute coronary syndrome  but the coronary arteries often appear normal  with no signs of significant stenosis. The disease disproportionately affects postmenopausal women  with a reported prevalence of 90%.  Patient Information  The patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian female who presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and lightheadedness. She originates from a rural region and lives alone. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension  for which she has been on medication (lisinopril 20 mg/day)  and type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin (1000 mg twice daily). She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.  Clinical Findings Physical examination reveals tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and elevated blood pressure at 160/100 mmHg. Auscultation of the lungs and heart is normal. Cardiovascular examination does not show jugular venous distention or peripheral edema. An initial EKG shows ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  suspecting an anterior wall myocardial infarction.   Diagnostic Assessment Lab findings reveal a Troponin T level elevated at 2.4 ng/ml (normal range: 0.00 - 0.10 ng/ml). A toxicology screen is negative. The patient undergoes an emergency coronary angiography  which surprisingly shows no significant obstructions or stenosis. The left ventricle appears apical ballooning and hypokinesis  which induces a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Therapeutic Intervention Standard heart failure treatment is initiated  including withholding her ACE inhibitor given the potential for hypotension. Medication includes aspirin  a beta-blocker (metoprolol)  a diuretic (furosemide)  and a statin. The patient’s symptoms steadily improve over the following days with supportive care and resolution of the cardiogenic shock.   Follow-up and Outcomes The patient is discharged with a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist. An echocardiograph obtained at the follow-up appointment three weeks later shows complete resolution of the ventricular dysfunction  confirming the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She is advised to continue medication  control risk factors  manage stress  and schedule regular follow-ups.   Conclusion This case highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in postmenopausal females presenting with chest pain and EKG changes mimicking a myocardial infarction. This rare syndrome necessitates careful clinical evaluation and is especially significant as its management varies from that of acute coronary syndrome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,59,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following Emotional Distress: A Case Report  Introduction:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a transient cardiac syndrome that mimics acute coronary syndrome. It is characterized by left ventricular apical ballooning due to severe systolic dysfunction. Recognized triggers include physical stress or emotional stress.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old Asian woman  a retired school teacher  who presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain. The pain started suddenly while she was attending the funeral of a close relative. She described it as a """"heavy"""" feeling in the center of her chest spreading to the left arm. There was no history of nausea  vomiting  or palpitations. She had a past medical history of hypertension and was allergic to penicillin.  On admission  her blood pressure was 150/90mmHg and pulse rate was 100 beats per minute. The ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Laboratory investigations showed elevated troponin T levels at 0.6ng/mL (normal range: <0.1ng/mL).  An echocardiogram demonstrated apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basal walls  characteristic of TTC. Coronary angiography was subsequently conducted  which showed no significant obstructive coronaries.  The patient was managed as a case of TTC based on the Mayo Clinic criteria. Her management included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and aspirin. She was also recommended a follow-up counseling appointment to manage emotional distress.  During her hospital stay  her chest symptoms improved  and she was discharged home on the fifth day. Her troponin T trends normalized slowly over the course of 2 weeks. Follow-up echocardiogram conducted after a month indicated a resolution of the previously seen apical ballooning  confirming the diagnosis of TTC.  Discussion:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  the phenomenon of reversible left ventricular apical ballooning presumably secondary to psychological stress  is more frequently reported among post-menopausal Asian women. The exact pathophysiology is unclear but is thought to involve catecholamine-induced myocardial stunning.  Conclusion:  It's important to consider TTC in differential diagnosis of acute chest pain  especially in post-menopausal women with recent emotional stressors  even in the absence of significant obstructive coronary artery disease. Timely diagnosis and management can lead to a complete recovery.  This case emphasizes the need for increased awareness among clinicians to identify and treat TTC promptly. It also underscores the role of psychological stress management in the prevention and management of TTC."

Patient Information:  Demographic Information: The patient is from a middle-class background  unmarried  retired school teacher  lives with her two adult daughters and is a non-smoker.   Clinical History: The patient has a 'controlled' history of hypertension for the last ten years and is on regular medication (Losartan 50mg/day). There is no known history of diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  recent infections  or family history of heart disease. She has reported no prior episodes of chest pain or ischemic heart disease events.  Examination and Investigations:  On examination  the patient appeared anxious and distressed. She was normotensive (BP: 130/80 mmHg) but tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. The ECG showed slight ST-T changes in the precordial leads  while the chest X-ray was normal.   Biochemical investigations revealed slightly elevated creatine kinase-MB and troponin levels. Her fasting blood sugar  lipid profile  and other blood indices were within the normal range.  An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning with a significantly reduced ejection fraction (35%) and no evidence of any significant valvular disease. Importantly  coronary angiography showed no significant atheromatous disease  particularly ruling out acute coronary syndrome.  Diagnosis and Managing:  Based on her clinical presentation  lab results and imaging findings  the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as broken heart syndrome.  The patient was managed conservatively with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers  as well as symptomatic relief measures. She was also referred to a psychologist considering her recent emotional upset as the potential trigger point.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates typical Takotsubo cardiomyopathy often associated with intense emotional or physical stress  commonly seen in post-menopausal women. It signifies the importance of considering TTC in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain in elderly women irrespective of their cardiovascular risk profile. The role of emotional distress in this condition is significant  highlighting an essential aspect of cardiology that reaches beyond the physical heart alone.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,61,"Title: Acute Distress Triggered Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman: A Case Report.   Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" is a transient cardiovascular condition frequently associated with emotional or physical distress. Though the disorder affects individuals across gender and age lines  post-menopausal women tend to exhibit higher susceptibility. This case report recounts the course of a 68-year-old Caucasian woman who developed TC after enduring a significant emotional event.  Patient Information: The patient is a Caucasian female  68-years-old  with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled with medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively). She has no tobacco  alcohol or illicit substance use history  and she lives a moderately active lifestyle  with a regular walking regimen. Prior to the event  her BMI was 27. She presented with no family history of cardiomyopathy or other significant heart diseases.  Clinical findings:  The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe chest pain  radiating to her left shoulder  reminiscent of cardiac etiology. On admission  her blood pressure was elevated at 150/90 despite her anti-hypertensive medication  with a slightly elevated heart rate of 100 beats per minute. ECG revealed ST-segment elevation suggestive of an ischemic event. Troponin levels were also slightly elevated.   Timeline:  Earlier that day before the chest pain started  the patient had received distressing news regarding the death of a close friend. Her symptoms occurred within a few hours after the event. Following the assessment and initial troponin result at the ED  an emergency coronary angiography was performed within two hours according to hospital procedure for suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS).  Diagnostic Assessment:  Coronary angiography rendered normal coronary arteries  negating ACS. An echocardiogram performed showed typical apical ballooning with systolic dysfunction - a hallmark of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The left ventricular ejection fraction was drastically reduced to 35 percent (normal >55%) with apical hypokinesia. These findings  coupled with her recent extreme emotional stress  made a classic case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was treated with standard heart failure regimen  composed of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker  under regular cardiology follow-ups. She received psychological counseling for her bereavement.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Repeat echocardiography  after three months  showed significant improvement in left ventricular function with ejection fraction restored to 58 percent.   Discussion: This case illustrates the strong emotional trigger often associated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition which is more prevalent in post-menopausal women. This highlights the importance of considering TC in the differential diagnosis of older women presenting with symptoms of ACS  especially following any major stress event.  Patient’s perspective: In hindsight  the patient reflected on the intense emotional distress and its potential role in triggering her cardiac event. She shared that her recovery sparked a newfound interest in stress management and mind-heart health.  Informed Consent: Obtained.  Conclusion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  though reversible  can present acutely mimicking ACS and requires rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment to ensure good clinical outcomes. Clinicians should maintain high suspicion in the right context  especially when treating post-menopausal women presenting with potential acute cardiac symptoms."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,62,Title: An Insight into Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome) in an Elderly Caucasian Female  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  frequently recognized as 'broken heart syndrome'  is a condition in which severe  sudden emotional stress or physical trauma causes a non-ischemic  transient  and left ventricular malfunction. This case report elucidates on Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a 68-year-old Caucasian female  whose condition was prompted by the sudden death of her spouse.  Case Presentation: A 68-year-old Caucasian female was rushed to the emergency department with complaints of severe chest pain  nausea  and shortness of breath. The symptoms resembled a myocardial infarction and had occurred abruptly following the death of her husband.  Patient’s medical history disclosed controlled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and no alcohol or tobacco use. Her family history included her mother’s ischemic heart disease. The patient's regular medication regimen contained a beta-blocker (Bisoprolol  5 mg daily) and a statin (Atorvastatin  20 mg daily). She reported non-compliance with medication for two days due to stress and grief over her husband's death.   Clinical Examination and Investigations: On physical examination  the temperature was 98.2°F  blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg  heart rate was 103 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation was 97% while breathing room air. ECG showed sinus tachycardia and ST-segment elevations in precordial leads. Troponin I level was elevated at 1.3 ng/mL.  An urgent echocardiogram revealed left ventricular apical akinesia with preserved basal function  and the estimated ejection fraction was 35-40%. Emergency cardiac catheterization displayed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease  consistent with the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment and Outcome: Immediately  she received treatment with a beta-blocker (Metoprolol  50 mg daily) and an ACE inhibitor (Lisinopril  10 mg daily). After four days  the patient reported significant relief from chest pain and dyspnea.   A repeat echocardiogram demonstrated improvement in left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 50%. The patient was discharged with complete cardiovascular medication management  including adherence to previous medication. A follow-up was planned in four weeks with frequent monitoring of electrolytes and renal function due to the new ACE inhibitor therapy.  Discussion: This case report underscores the profound physiological effects of emotional stress. The incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is higher in post-menopausal women  particularly 58-75 years old  and is often triggered by severe emotional stress. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain this  including catecholamine-mediated myocardial stunning.  The patient's health improved with appropriate medical management  emphasizing the reversibility of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Despite the benign course in most patients  potential complications like heart failure  arrhythmias  and thromboembolism require vigilant monitoring and appropriate treatment measures.  Conclusion: It is crucial for clinicians to consider Takotsubo cardiomyopathy when evaluating older women presenting with chest pain  particularly in the context of a recent emotional stressor. This case also highlights the necessity of patient education for medication compliance  particularly during stressful times. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,63,"Title: A Case Report on a Middle-Aged Caucasian Female with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Presentation:  Mrs. E  a 54-year-old Caucasian woman  presented in the ER with severe chest pain. Standing at a height of 5'5""""  she had an estimated weight of 70 kilograms. She worked as an elementary school teacher and lived with her husband with no children. She came from the Midwest with no familial medical history available at the time of diagnosis.  Medical History:  The patient was known to have well-controlled hypertension  diagnosed six years prior and was regularly taking hydrochlorothiazide. No known allergies were recorded. She was a non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption (occasional glass of red wine). Her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer) and father with type 2 diabetes  but the patient had neither condition. She was previously diagnosed with depression after the loss of her parents two years ago. She had no previous hospitalizations and had an otherwise healthy medical history.  Current Status:  The chest pain was sudden onset  severe  and radiating towards the left shoulder. It was described as """"sharp"""" and """"crushing"""" in nature but with no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath  dizziness  or syncope. The pain started within an hour while confronting an extremely stressful situation at home  which caused an emotional outburst.  Investigations and Results:  Initial ECG revealed ST-elevation indicative of an acute myocardial injury. Cardiac markers such as Troponins were significantly elevated. Further evaluation with echocardiography showed characteristic findings consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with apical ballooning and hypokinesis seen. Coronary angiography  performed to rule out acute coronary syndrome  showed no significant coronary artery disease.  Treatment and Outcome:  The patient was immediately started on treatment with guideline-directed heart failure treatment options including Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. Her clinical course was monitored  with symptomatic improvement noted in the following 72 hours. She was discharged with instructions for close outpatient follow-up and stress management strategies. She has been following up regularly in the outpatient cardiology clinic for the last six months  managing well  and showing no signs of repeat episodes.   Conclusion:  This case illustrates the typical presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as Broken Heart Syndrome. A diagnostic challenge to differentiate from acute coronary syndrome  it primarily affects post-menopausal women triggered by severe stress  both physical and emotional. The importance of stress management in dealing with this condition is highlighted  as is the indispensable role of a prompt and accurate diagnosis for effective symptom management. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,64,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in an Elderly Caucasian Female following the Death of Significant Other  Abstract: The following case report discusses an incidence of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" in a 75-year-old Caucasian female. TTC is typically found in post-menopausal women  in a population ratio of 9:1 (female:male)  and prevalence in the Caucasian demographic. The patient presented with left ventricular dysfunction following acute emotional stress  which is an established triggering event for TTC.  Case Description: Mrs. P  a 75-year-old woman of Caucasian descent  visited the emergency room with complaints of chest pain and difficulty breathing. She had no prior history of coronary artery diseases or any significant cardiac disorders. Her medical background includes controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes. The symptoms began shortly after Mrs. P learned about her husband's sudden death  signifying acute emotional stress contributed to the clinical scenario.  Examination & Investigations: In the emergency room  her blood pressure was recorded as 160/90mmHg  and her pulse rate was 110 beats per minute. An electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. However  coronary angiography showed no significant obstruction in her coronary arteries  contrary to typical myocardial infarction symptoms. An echocardiogram displayed a dilated and hypokinetic left ventricle apex  a feature of TTC.  Treatment & Follow-Up: Mrs. P was treated with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and diuretics for the TTC. After stabilization  she was started on a combination of antidepressants and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to manage the grief stress. An echocardiogram repeated after six weeks showed normalization of the left ventricular function  confirming the diagnosis of TTC. In the next few months  regular psychiatric evaluations and cardiac check-ups stabilized her emotional and physical health.  Discussion: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  often linked to emotional or physical stress  presents like an acute coronary syndrome but usually occurs in the absence of any significant coronary artery disease. The patient presented in this case report had similar features. High index of suspicion is needed for diagnosis in the right demographic  as it may offer better means of management and prevent complications.  Conclusion: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is a condition that requires a multidisciplinary approach for comprehensive care  including psychiatrists and cardiologists. Early diagnosis and management can lead to full recovery and prevention of subsequent heart failure.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,65,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Hispanic Female: A Case Report  Introduction:   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a transient left ventricular dysfunction usually precipitated by severely stressful events. While it primarily affects post-menopausal women  its occurrence presents as an intriguing phenomenon in discussions of diverse demographic representation in the medical field.  Case Description:  The patient is a 62-year-old Hispanic female who presented to our emergency department with severe retrosternal chest pain radiating to her left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath. She reported no previously documented cardiac history and was a nonsmoker with regulated type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  The pain started precipitously after she learned about the sudden demise of her younger brother an hour prior to the start of her symptoms. Her physical exam showed faint bibasilar lung crackles and elevated blood pressure (165/95 mmHg). Her heart rate was 110 bpm  and she appeared in apparent distress. Initial electrocardiogram (EKG) findings demonstrated ST-segment elevation in precordial leads V2–V5  suggestive of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.  Prompt administration of aspirin  sublingual nitroglycerin and intravenous access was facilitated. Cardiology was consulted immediately. She was admitted to the coronary care unit. Troponin levels were found to be elevated at 3.78 ng/ml (normal: <0.04 ng/ml) during her initial lab workup.  Given the patient's EKG changes  she underwent coronary angiography  which surprisingly showed no significant stenosis or occlusions to explain her presenting symptoms. Left ventriculography  however  revealed a classic finding of apical ballooning with preserved basal function of the heart  leading to a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Patient was managed conservatively with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers and her usual antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications were optimized. Gradually  her pain alleviated  and her vitals stabilized.  After seven days of hospital care  the patient was discharged with a scheduled follow-up. A repeat echocardiogram at her 3-month follow-up indicated complete resolution of her left ventricular dysfunction  further confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Conclusions:  This case underscores the critical importance of recognizing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in post-menopausal women  particularly among the Hispanic population who present with chest pain following severally stressful events. It also brings attention to the importance of the biopsychosocial model in the assessment and management of such patients.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,66,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following Severe Emotional Stress: A Case Study  Introduction: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCC)  also known as Broken Heart Syndrome  is a transient condition characterized by severe reduction in left ventricular function (LVF) following exposure to intense physical or emotional stress. This significant clinical condition can pose serious implications if not immediately diagnosed and managed.  Herein  we describe a case of a 72-year-old Asian female who suffered from TCC following severe emotional distress.  Case Presentation: A 72-year-old Asian woman presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain. She reported that the pain started abruptly and was associated with shortness of breath and lightheadedness. She had no significant past medical history  although she was noted to be grieving her spouse  who passed away just a week before.  Physical examination on presentation suggested acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Vital signs were Blood Pressure: 120/80 mmHg  Heart Rate: 95 beats per minute  Temperature: 98.6 F  and Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads  further suggesting an AMI.  However  coronary angiography performed to confirm the suspected AMI showed no evidence of significant coronary artery disease. Instead  the left ventriculography exhibited apical ballooning of ventricular segments - a classic imaging feature of TCC  leading to the diagnosis.  The patient's troponin level peaked at 2.0 ng/mL eighteen hours after the onset of chest pain and gradually declined thereafter. Echocardiography performed after 48 hours showed significant recovery of left ventricular function. The ventricular ejection fraction (EF) that was reduced to about 35% on presentation improved to 60%  strengthening the diagnosis of TCC.  Discussion: This case represents an important prototype presentation of TCC in an older woman following a severe emotional stressor. The exact pathophysiology of the condition is unclear  but it is related to sudden emotional stress leading to excessive sympathetic stimulation  thereby causing myocardial stunning.  Although TCC is usually benign  it can lead to severe complications such as heart failure  arrhythmia  and thromboembolism  emphasizing the need for early recognition and appropriate management.  Conclusion: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy should be considered as a differential diagnosis in older women presenting with symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome  especially in the context of recent emotional stress. Early identification and appropriate management are critical to prevent lethal complications and assure a good prognosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,67,Title: Transient Left Ventricular Dysfunction (Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy) Triggered by Acute Emotional Stress: A Case Report   Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome is a transient cardiac syndrome that involves left ventricular apical akinesis. This condition mimics acute coronary syndrome and is often preceded by severe emotional or physical stress. The condition's mechanism is thought to be related to excessive catecholamine release.   Patient Information:  A 74-year old Asian female from the Midwest United States presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to her left shoulder. The patient lives alone and recently experienced a traumatic event  the sudden death of her life-long partner. She is a non-smoker and doesn't drink alcohol. She previously managed her hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus with regular medications. She has a known history of hyperlipidemia and mild osteoarthritis.  Clinical Findings:  The patient was conscious but looked distressed. Her vital signs were recorded as- blood pressure of 150/80 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Cardiac examination showed tachycardia with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Lung fields were clear  and no peripheral edema was noted.   Timeline: The patient was rushed into the emergency room after the onset of acute chest pain. Electrocardiography (ECG) was performed immediately  showing ST-segment elevation in the anteroseptal leads (V1-V4). Subsequently  coronary angiography was ordered to rule out acute coronary syndrome.   Diagnostic Assessment: Laboratory tests showed mildly raised cardiac enzymes - Troponin T was elevated at 0.4 ng/mL. Other serum lab results  including levels of blood glucose  cholesterol levels  creatinine  liver enzymes  and complete blood count  were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed apical ballooning with systolic apical ballooning and contraction of the base of the heart  suggesting Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient's coronary angiography showed no significant obstructive coronary disease.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was immediately treated with aspirin  beta-blockers  and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Her chest pain reduced  and she became hemodynamically stable over the next few hours.   Follow Up and Outcome:  Over the next five days  the patient's condition improved significantly. Repeat echocardiography after five days demonstrated complete resolution of ventricular dysfunction. The patient was discharged on the 7th day with medications including a beta-blocker  an ACE inhibitor  and low-dose aspirin.  Patient Perspective:  The patient was initially frightened due to the sudden onset of chest pain but felt reassured after the doctor's explanation of her condition. She felt she had received good care and plans to consult with her doctor about possible interventions to manage her stress and grief.   Informed Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.  Conclusion:  This case augments the understanding of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis among older adults presenting with chest pain  particularly in those who have recently experienced severe stress. This condition  despite mimicking an acute coronary syndrome  often resolves spontaneously with supportive care.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,68,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy following Emotional Stress: A Case Report  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also commonly known as Broken Heart Syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy  is a distinct type of acute heart failure typically precipitated by intense emotional or physical strain. It is predominantly reported in postmenopausal women.  Case Presentation: We report a case of a 69-year-old African-American female with a history of well-controlled hypertension  who presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  shortness of breath that started almost immediately after receiving the news of her eldest daughter's sudden death. The pain was described as crushing in nature  located at the center of her chest  with no radiation  and did not improve with rest or nitroglycerin.  Physical examination revealed a well-nourished elderly  distressed female  with pallor and diaphoresis  blood pressure of 165/95 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  and respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular rhythm  there were no murmurs  rubs or gallops  lung fields were clear  and there was no peripheral edema.  Investigations: The electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated diffuse ST-segment elevation. Subsequent laboratory results showed elevated cardiac troponin I levels. However  an urgent coronary angiography revealed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease  a typical feature of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. An echocardiogram portrayed a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 35%  with akinesis of the mid-apical segments  and basal hyperkinesis suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Management and Outcome: The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit and managed for acute heart failure. Her regimen included beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics  which resulted in significant improvement of her symptoms. Repeat echocardiographic examination at six weeks follow-up showed normalization of the heart function  with an EF of 55%.  Discussion: Our patient's demographic  clinical presentation  and precipitating emotional stress are typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is reported more in post-menopausal women (average age 67 years) and notably after a severe emotional stressor. Paradoxically  despite the acute presentation  the overall prognosis is generally good with appropriate management.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of recognizing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as an important differential among elderly women presenting with acute chest pain  particularly following intense emotional stress. Early recognition and appropriate management of this condition are essential to prevent severe complications.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,69,Title: An Unusual Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following Emotional Stress  Patient Information:  A 67-year-old Caucasian female  resident of rural Iowa  USA  living alone in her property. She has a known history of hypertension and anxiety disorder  controlled with lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) and sertraline respectively. The patient denies smoking or drinking alcohol. There is no known history of illicit drug use. Her family history is significant for ischemic heart disease in her paternal side.  Clinical Findings:  The patient presented to the rural area clinic with acute onset chest pain  characterized as heavy and radiating to her left arm. The pain started a few hours after receiving news of her younger brother’s sudden demise.  Associated symptoms include shortness of breath  palpitations  profuse sweating  and dizziness. She has no history of similar symptoms in the past.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Her initial blood pressure was 158/90 mmHg  with a heart rate of 115 beats per minute. An EKG showed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V5 but no Q waves or loss of R wave progression  which together with the timeline of the symptoms raised a suspicion for takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Labs showed slightly elevated Troponin I levels. Normal complete blood count  lipid profile  and mildly elevated blood glucose levels were noted.  A coronary angiogram demonstrated no significant obstructive coronary artery disease  which ruled out the initial suspicion of myocardial infarction. Echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesis consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was managed in the intensive care unit for close monitoring. She was started on beta-blockers to slow down the heart rate and relieve the symptoms. Lisinopril dosage was adjusted to optimize blood pressure control. Low dose aspirin was incorporated in her regimen for its cardioprotective effect.   Follow-up and Outcome:  The patient had an uncomplicated course in the hospital. There was a substantial improvement in her symptoms. A repeat echocardiogram after a month showed a normalization of the left ventricular function.  Patient Perspective:  The news of her brother's death was extremely traumatic for the patient  contributing to emotional stress which likely precipitated the takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She expressed her commitment to continue psychological therapy to better handle her emotions.  Informed Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.  Conclusion:  This is a classical case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  typically observed in postmenopausal women following a severe emotional distress  with complete recovery of cardiac function achieved by conservative management. Medical history  presentation  and examination should guide towards takotsubo cardiomyopathy when circumstances align  and decision towards invasive procedure should be guided by patient's condition  symptomatology  and potential benefits.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,70,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman Following a Period of Intense Emotional Stress   Introduction:   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy  is a syndrome characterized by transient and reversible left ventricular dysfunction. This condition mimics acute coronary syndrome but unlike it  coronary angiography is generally unremarkable. It predominantly affects postmenopausal women and it is often preceded by emotional or physical stress. This case report is about a postmenopausal woman presenting with chest pain after severe emotional stress who was found to have takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Patient Information:  The patient  Mrs. X  is a 67-year-old Caucasian woman living in San Diego  California. Her primary language is English  and she is retired after spending most of her life as a school teacher.   Mrs. X has a past medical history significant for hypertension  controlled by a regimen of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide  and hypothyroidism  managed with Levothyroxine. There is no family history of any cardiac conditions. She is a non-smoker  consumes alcohol occasionally in moderation  and leads a physically active lifestyle.   Clinical Findings:  Mrs. X presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain that started a few hours following the sudden death of her husband. The pain was described as 'crushing' in nature radiating to the left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath and diaphoresis.   In the emergency department  her blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  pulse was 110 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads V1-V4. Initial blood work revealed elevated troponin levels.   Diagnosis:  Given the patient's presenting symptoms  ECG changes  and raised troponin  an initial diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome was made. An emergent coronary angiography was performed which showed no significant coronary artery disease. Subsequently  a left ventriculography was performed which revealed apical ballooning and hyperkinesis of the basal walls  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment:  She was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit and treated with heart failure regimen including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. Her symptoms improved over days and a repeat echocardiography revealed normalization of left ventricular function a week later  further confirming the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""" is a relatively rare condition  seen predominantly in postmenopausal women. It often follows an episode of severe emotional or physiological stress. The mechanism of the syndrome is still a subject of research  though one hypothesis proposes that it might be due to a surge of stress hormones stunning the heart. In this case  the severe emotional stress of sudden spousal loss likely triggered the condition in the patient. The case reinforces the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis when a postmenopausal female presents with symptoms and signs mimicking acute coronary syndrome.  Conclusion:  Although rare  takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be considered  especially in postmenopausal women under intense stress. Early recognition is crucial to ensure appropriate treatment and favorable prognosis."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,71,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman Following an Emotional Event: A Case Report  Patient Profile: A 68-year-old Asian woman who presented to the Emergency Department. The patient was a widow who lived with her daughter and her son-in-law and was retired from her work as a school teacher. She had no history of smoking or alcohol use  and she had been following a vegetarian diet for nearly 20 years.   Past Medical History: The patient had been diagnosed with hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  both of which were under control with oral medications. Approximately 10 years prior to the current clinical presentation  the patient had been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder  for which she had been receiving counseling and medication. She did not have a family or personal history of cardiac disease. Her medication included a beta-blocker for hypertension  metformin for diabetes  and an SSRI for anxiety.  Presenting Complaint: At the time of admission  she complained of severe chest pain that had started suddenly a few hours before arriving at the hospital. The pain was described as ‘crushing’ and radiating to the neck and arms. The onset of symptoms was shortly following an intense emotional event – the sudden death of her pet dog.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient was in obvious distress  with diaphoresis and she looked pale. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 170/95mmHg  pulse rate 110bpm  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  and SpO2 of 92% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed no obvious abnormalities. There was no history of trauma.  Investigations: An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads suggestive of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. Cardiac biomarkers showed minimal elevation in troponin I levels. Coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease which failed to explain the ECG changes. Echocardiogram showed an impaired left ventricular function with apical ballooning and hypercontractile basal segments consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC).  Management and Outcome: The patient was started on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor  beta-blocker  and a statin. Due to the traumatic event preceding the TT attack  the patient was also referred to a psychologist. After a week  a repeat echocardiogram showed significant improvement in left ventricular function. The patient was discharged home and followed up in the cardiology outpatient clinic after a week. The patient was symptom-free at the one-month  six-month  and one-year follow-ups.  Conclusion: This case illustrates how an acute emotional event can precipitate takotsubo cardiomyopathy  even in the absence of overt cardiac disease. Adequate diagnosis and management can lead to a full recovery  but it underscores the necessity of considering psychosocial factors in cardiovascular health. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,72,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following Emotional Stress in a Postmenopausal Woman  Patient Profile:   Mrs. X is a 68-year-old Caucasian postmenopausal woman  living independently in Milwaukee  Wisconsin  USA. She has a history of well-controlled hypertension  which she manages with lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril).  Presenting Complaint:  Mrs. X presented to our emergency department reporting ongoing severe chest pain accompanied by shortness of breath. Notably  she had experienced the sudden loss of her husband approximately one week prior  leading to an intense emotional stress period.  Clinical Findings:  The patient had an elevated heart rate of 105 beats per minute  blood pressure was 155/95 mmHg  and respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ST-segment elevation in anterior leads  suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.   Diagnostic Assessment:  Blood test results revealed a mild increase in troponin levels. An echocardiogram and subsequent coronary angiogram were performed. The former revealed left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome (LVABS)  otherwise known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy  with preserved basal function. The latter showed no evidence of occlusive coronary artery disease  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  already suspected given the clinical and echocardiographic findings.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Given the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  Mrs. X received supportive care  including beta-blockers (Metoprolol) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as part of her therapeutic regime. She was also counselled on stress management techniques and directed towards bereavement supports.  Follow-Up:  A follow-up echocardiogram after four weeks showed significant improvement of left ventricular function. There were no reported episodes of chest pain  and her blood pressure was well controlled. A repeat echocardiogram at 8 weeks demonstrated complete resolution of wall motion abnormalities.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the need for physicians to consider takotsubo cardiomyopathy in postmenopausal women presenting with acute chest pain  especially when recent emotional stress is evident. Early recognition and management provide an excellent prognosis for takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It also highlights the judicious use of coronary angiography for differential diagnosis from acute coronary syndrome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,73,Title: A Case Report on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman   Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often referred to as 'stress-induced cardiomyopathy' or 'broken heart syndrome ' is a syndrome characterized by transient apical ballooning of the left ventricle (LV) in the absence of coronary artery disease that could justify transitory LV dysfunction. Despite being initially described in Japan in 1990  this condition is recognized worldwide affecting predominantly postmenopausal women.   Patient Information: A 67-year-old Caucasian female patient with no substantial past medical history presented to the emergency department complaining of chest pain and difficulty in breathing. The patient was a retired elementary school teacher  a non-smoker  and reported occasional consumption of alcohol. There was no known cardiac disease in the family.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  her blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  pulse rate was 110 beats/min  and respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min. Cardiac auscultation was normal  without any murmur observed. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4  and chest X-ray did not reveal pulmonary congestion or any other abnormalities.  Diagnosis & Treatment: Based on the initial presentation  the patient was diagnosed with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)  and immediate percutaneous coronary intervention was carried out. However  the angiogram revealed no significant coronary artery disease. The echocardiogram done subsequently showed apical and mid-ventricular dyskinesis with hyperkinesis of the basal walls  known as apical ballooning  a typical feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced (36%). Troponin I level was elevated at 10 ng/ml (normal range 0-0.04 ng/ml).   Hospital course: The patient was managed with supportive care  which includes beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and aspirin. She was also given medications to control her blood pressure. Progress was uneventful  and the patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the hospital stay. An echocardiogram repeated six weeks later showed complete normalization of left ventricular function.  Discussion: Despite its often dramatic initial presentation  takotsubo cardiomyopathy is significantly reversible  which was reflected in this patient’s case. Prompt recognition and management of this syndrome is essential given its potential adverse outcomes  including severe left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure. The physical and emotional triggers leading to takotsubo cardiomyopathy in this patient could not be identified.  Conclusion:  This case report emphasizes potential misdiagnosis as acute coronary syndrome and highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in postmenopausal woman presenting with chest pain and transient apical ballooning. Though the triggers couldn't be identified in this case  it's often found that emotional or physical stress precedes the onset of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Future exploration into this patient population could provide better understanding and eventual prevention of this disease.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,74,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-Year-Old Caucasian Female: A Case Report   Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome """" is an acute  reversible condition characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction  most frequently affecting postmenopausal women. It mimics the symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS)  often triggered by physical or emotional stress. Here  we report a case of TCM in a 68-year-old Caucasian woman triggered by the sudden death of her husband.  Case Presentation: Patient Information: Ms. A is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  a widow for about a week  presented to our hospital with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. She is a retired school teacher with no history of smoking  alcohol  or drug abuse. She lives alone and has been in a state of emotional distress since her husband's sudden death due to motor vehicular accident seven days ago.  Medical History: Ms. A has a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension (on thiazide diuretic) and hyperlipidemia. She has no history of ischemic heart disease  diabetes mellitus  or any other significant chronic illnesses. There is no history of significant psychological disorders.  Clinical Findings: On examination  she had a blood pressure 150/92 mmHg  pulse rate 110 bpm  respiratory rate 20/min  with cold peripheries. No cardiac murmurs were detected. The ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  and her Troponin I level was elevated.  Diagnostic Assessment: The patient received immediate care under the suspicion of ACS. However  coronary angiography showed no significant obstruction  which  coupled with the triggering stress event  led to the consideration of TCM. A subsequent echocardiogram displayed apical ballooning with hyperkinesia of the basal walls  a typical hallmark of TCM.  Therapeutic intervention: The patient was managed initially with aspirin  clopidogrel  and unfractionated heparin based on the suspected diagnosis of ACS. After the definitive diagnosis of TCM  she was maintained on beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and her regular antihypertensive medication. Psychological support was incorporated alongside the pharmacological treatment due to the underlying emotional stressor.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: Ms. A showed progressive improvement in her symptoms over the next several days  with complete resolution of chest pain and normalization of cardiac enzyme levels. Repeat echocardiography after four weeks exhibited resolution of the left ventricular function  consistent with TCM's reversible nature.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the relevance of recognizing TCM as a differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with symptoms mimicking ACS  especially when precipitated by significant emotional stressors. It underscores the critical role of comprehensive assessment  including advanced cardiac imaging modalities and understanding the pathobiological role of stress in managing these patients."

She is a retired school teacher and has been living alone since her husband's death five years ago. She has no known allergies and is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She has no known family history of heart disease.  III. Current Illness and Assessment: Mrs. X presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain that had developed suddenly during a stressful argument earlier in the day. The initial physical examination showed a mildly distressed woman with a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The electrocardiogram (ECG) performed immediately upon arrival showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Initial Troponin level was elevated.  IV. Diagnostic Assessment: Coronary angiogram revealed no significant coronary artery stenosis  and left ventriculogram showed classic """"octopus-pot"""" appearance characteristic of TTC with apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesis. The echocardiography showed reduced ejection fraction of 35% along with left ventricular apical akinesis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not demonstrate any late gadolinium enhancement  ruling out myocardial infarction.  V. Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was treated conservatively with aspirin  beta-blockers  and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The symptoms of chest pain alleviated  and repeated echocardiography after four weeks showed significant improvement in left ventricular function  with the ejection fraction returned to normal.   VI. Follow-Up and Outcomes: The patient was discharged from the hospital after one week and advised to continue medications and regular cardiac follow-ups. Stress management and cardiac rehabilitation were also advised. On subsequent follow-ups  the patient has not reported any further chest pain episodes.  VII. Take-Away Message: This case highlights the importance of considering TTC in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain  especially in postmenopausal women after a stressful event. Though TTC often mimics myocardial infarction  coronary angiography assists in distinguishing between the two. This case also underscores the significance of lifestyle modifications  especially managing psychosocial stressors in preventing recurrent episodes of TTC.     VIII. Patient Consent: Informed patient consent was obtained for the publication of the details pertaining to this case. No personal identification information has been provided in the case."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,76,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Female: A Case Report  Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female  who is a non-smoker and maintains a moderate alcohol consumption pattern. She is a retired teacher and lives with her husband. There is no information available regarding her family history of cardiovascular disease. Her past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia.  Clinical findings: The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  rated 8/10  radiating to the left arm. Accompanying symptoms were nausea and cold sweats. She reported feeling severe emotional stress after the sudden death of her brother three days ago. Measurement of vital functions showed blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg  heart rate of 120 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with slightly labored breathing.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior-lateral leads. Serum troponin I level was significantly elevated (3.5 ng/mL; reference <0.04 ng/mL). Echocardiography showed hypokinesia of the apical and mid segments of the left ventricle  with preserved function in the basal segments creating the typical 'apical ballooning' appearance  characteristic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome'. Coronary angiogram showed mild atherosclerosis without significant stenosis.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment: The patient was admitted to the cardiology intensive care unit where she was treated with aspirin  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. Her symptoms markedly improved over the next few days with normalization of ECG changes. Repeat echocardiography after a week showed recovery of the left ventricular function.  Follow-up and outcomes: Over a course of six months  the patient has attended monthly follow-up visits and reports no recurrent chest pain or other cardiovascular symptoms. She also consulted with a psychologist for coping strategies to manage emotional stress.  Patient Perspective: The patient reported that she was initially frightened by the diagnosis but felt reassured by the normal recovery and the regular follow-ups. The loss of her brother was a major life event for her and she felt her chest pains were a 'manifestation of her broken heart'.  Key Learning Points: This case illustrates that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can mimic an acute coronary syndrome and is often triggered by severe emotional stressors. It is more frequently seen in postmenopausal women and is typically associated with a favorable prognosis with appropriate management and supportive care. It emphasizes the significant impact of emotional stress on cardiovascular health. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,77,Title: A Case Report on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman Following a Severe Emotional Stressor  Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC)  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is a condition characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction often associated with emotional or physical stress. While the exact pathophysiology is unclear  hyperactivity of the autonomic nervous system plays a significant role. The condition is most common in post-menopausal women  mirroring the case under discussion.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency room with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  accompanied by nausea and shortness of breath. Her symptoms began suddenly earlier that morning shortly after she received news of her sister's untimely death. She denied any history of chest pain  dyspnea  or syncope.   Past Medical History:  Her past medical history included well-controlled type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension  for which she took Metformin and Lisinopril respectively. She had no history of cardiovascular disease  smoking  or alcohol abuse.  Clinical Examination:  Physical examination revealed an anxious female patient with a blood pressure of 165/90 mm Hg and a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Her body mass index was within the normal range. Lung auscultation revealed clear breath sounds bilaterally and the cardiac exam showed no abnormal sounds.  Investigations:  An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation in precordial leads V2 - V5 and Troponin was significantly elevated  creating an initial impression of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However  emergency coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease to support a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.  The patient was further evaluated with an echocardiogram that demonstrated apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved basal function  a hallmark of TC. The ejection fraction was reduced to 35%.  Management:  The patient was initially managed as an acute coronary syndrome with aspirin  clopidogrel  and low molecular weight heparin. Once diagnosed with TC  management involved beta-blockers  an ACE inhibitor  and supportive care. Psychiatry was involved for management of her grief and associated stress.  Outcome and Follow-up:  Within the following week  the patient’s symptoms resolved completely. A repeat echocardiogram performed four weeks later showed the complete reversal of the left ventricular dysfunction. The patient’s medications were gradually withdrawn  and she was advised to avoid extreme emotional and physical stress.  Discussion:  This case illustrates a typical presentation of TC  which has a strong predilection for post-menopausal women (up to 90% of cases)  contrasting to the low incidence (1.2 per 100 000) among the general population. The emotional stressor  her sister's death in this case  is often seen as a trigger.  Conclusion:  A high index of suspicion  the discerning application of diagnostic modalities  and a thorough understanding of the pathophysiological differences from acute coronary syndrome are key for the timely diagnosis and management of TC. Adequate support  including psychiatric help  is crucial for recovery and prevention of recurrence.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,78,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Female Following Emotional Stress: A Case Report   Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy  is a syndrome characterized by temporary  reversible left ventricular dysfunction in response to severe psychological or physical stress. This condition predominantly affects postmenopausal women  accounting for about 90% of all reported cases.  Case Description: Patient's Profile: A 68-year-old African-American woman was presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain that radiated to her left arm  palpitations  and mild dyspnea which started around three hours earlier. She reported having experienced a significant emotional stressor - the recent loss of her husband  after a prolonged battle with a terminal illness. The patient had a past medical history of hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  controlled with pharmacotherapy. She denied any allergies and had no family history of heart disease. Her body mass index (BMI) was 24.5 kg/m2  thus she was not overweight. She was a non-smoker and abstained from alcohol.  Clinical Investigations: Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ST Segment elevation in leads V2 to V6  suggestive of acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  her cardiac biomarkers  such as troponin  were only mildly elevated. Emergency coronary angiogram revealed no significant coronary artery disease  contrasting the initial ECG abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed apical and mid-ventricular akinesis with preserved basal function  also termed as 'apical ballooning ' which is the classic feature of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management: The patient was managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers  along with guideline-directed medical therapy for chronic heart failure  including diuretics and anticoagulation. She was admitted to a Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) for close monitoring.  Outcome: During her hospital stay  the patient remained stable with a gradual reduction in her chest pain. Serial ECGs noted a resolution of the prior ST-segment changes. Repeat echocardiography after ten days demonstrated significant improvement in her prior wall motion abnormalities. She was discharged in a stable condition with a plan for outpatient follow-up.  Conclusion: This case demonstrates Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a postmenopausal woman triggered by severe emotional stress. Given the misleading initial ECG changes mimicking acute myocardial infarction  the recognition of TTC can be challenging. This condition usually leads to a favorable outcome with appropriate management and cessation of the stressor  highlighting the importance of early detection and precise diagnosis.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,79,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following Emotional Stress: An Unusual Presentation  Case Report:  A 68-year-old African American woman presented to the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary hospital with complaints of severe chest pain. The chest pain was sudden in onset  described as crushing in nature  localized at the center of the chest  and radiating to the left arm. Accompanying symptoms included blurring of vision  shortness of breath  and significant perspiration.   The patient has a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  and was on regular medication with a complete adherence history. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. She had recently faced the unexpected death of her husband  which was a significant emotional stressor.  In the ED  her blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  pulse 100 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was promptly performed  showing ST-elevation in the anterior leads  mimicking an acute coronary syndrome.  Given the patient’s symptomatology and ECG changes  she was immediately administered dual antiplatelet therapy  beta-blockers  and high-intensity statins  in line with the current guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndrome.  Serum troponin-I was significantly elevated  further raising suspicion of acute coronary syndrome. However  a coronary angiogram revealed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease. Further evaluation with transthoracic echocardiography showed apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesis consistent with the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  She was shifted to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic monitoring and treated conservatively. The patient remained hemodynamically stable  and her chest pain gradually subsided over the next 48 hours. A repeat echocardiography was then performed  which showed substantial normalization of the left ventricular function.  During her stay  the patient was counseled regarding the nature of her condition. She was provided a stress management plan  which included referral to a therapist. Upon discharge  her home medications for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes were optimized. Furthermore  the patient was also started on low-dose aspirin and statins as secondary prophylaxis.  This case underlines the importance of recognizing takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in older women presenting with chest pain  especially in the context of recent emotional stress. Moreover  it highlights the necessity of a comprehensive and supportive approach towards patient care  acknowledging and addressing significant emotional stressors that may precipitate such conditions.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,80,Title: A Case Report on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-year-old African American Female  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is a transient cardiac syndrome that involves left ventricular apical akinesia. Often triggered by severe stress  TCM typically occurs in postmenopausal women. The following case report describes a TCM occurrence in a 68-year-old African American female.  Case Presentation: The patient  Mrs. L  is a 68-year-old African American female  a retired teacher  with a history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension. She presented to the Emergency Department with severe chest pain and dyspnea that had started suddenly earlier in the day. The onset of these symptoms coincided with the news of her brother’s sudden death. With a Body Mass Index of 27 and being a non-smoker  Mrs. L maintained a balanced diet and regularly light physical activity.  Mrs. L's blood pressure on arrival was elevated (170/90 mmHg). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  and her initial troponin level was found to be significantly increased (3.2 ng/mL). Given these findings  she was initially diagnosed with an Acute Anterior ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)  and immediate coronary angiography was performed.  The angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease to attribute to her condition. Consequently  a left ventriculogram was performed  and it demonstrated apical ballooning with basal hypercontraction – typical findings in TCM.  Her prior control medications for hypertension and diabetes included Metformin and Lisinopril. After her diagnosis  the regimen was continued with the addition of Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors to manage her TCM. Due to the nature of her trigger - the sudden death of her brother  a psychiatrist was consulted  who diagnosed her with acute stress reaction and recommended support and brief psychotherapy.  Discussion: TCM is commonly mistaken initially for acute coronary syndrome due to similar presenting symptoms and ECG changes but is typically diagnosed after performing coronary angiography or ventriculogram. Stress appears to be a predominant precipitant  similar to the case of Mrs. L.  Conclusion: This case highlights the significance of comprehensive clinical evaluation in acute chest pain settings and the critical role of emotional stressors in triggering TCM  especially among postmenopausal African American women who represent an important demographic risk category for this disorder. Further multidisciplinary management  involving cardiology and psychiatric consultation  seems integral to the management of such conditions.  
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,81,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-menopausal Female following Death of her Spouse: A Case Report  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a form of acute  reversible left ventricular dysfunction primarily affecting post-menopausal women.  Case Presentation: A 68-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history that includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of acute chest pain radiating to her left arm 3 days following the death of her husband. Her symptoms were associated with shortness of breath  nausea  and profuse sweating. With no history of smoking or substance abuse  the patient has been compliant with her medications and adopts a balanced diet. The patient reports a stressful event - the death of her husband - that occurred 3 days prior to the onset of these symptoms.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  the patient was pale and mildly diaphoretic  with blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg  heart rate at 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed a normal S1 and S2 with no audible murmurs  rubs  or gallops. There were no significant findings on the physical examination or laboratory and radiology results  except electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads  indicating possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS).  Diagnostic Assessment: After her initial workup  coronary angiography was done which showed no significant stenosis to suggest ACS. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of around 40%  with apical hypokinesia and hyperkinesia of the basilar segments  giving the impression of a 'takotsubo'  hence confirming the diagnosis of TTC.  Therapeutics: The patient started on a regimen of beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for her TTC. Her hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia were managed appropriately.   Outcome and Follow-up: Short-term follow-up after six weeks demonstrated an improvement with her symptoms. Repeat echocardiography showed complete recovery of left ventricular function with normalization of LVEF. A complete cardiac rehabilitation program was recommended to prevent further episodes.   Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome  especially in post-menopausal women experiencing severe emotional distress. The primary focus should be on reducing the risk of long-term complications with early recognition and appropriate management.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,82,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy following Severe Emotional Stress in a 68-Year-Old Female Patient  Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  characteristically presents with symptoms mimicking an acute myocardial infarction in the absence of any significant coronary artery disease. It is a transient cardiac syndrome predominantly affecting postmenopausal women.   Case Report:  - Demographic Information: The patient was a 68-year-old African-American female  retired primary school teacher  who was widowed 4 years ago. - Presenting Complaint: She presented to the emergency room (ER) with acute chest pain  associated with difficulty in breathing. The patient had been suffering from acute emotional stress following the sudden death of her close friend. - Past Medical History: The patient was known to have hypertension and was on medication (calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics). Other past medical history included hyperlipidemia for which she took statins  and a history of anxiety and depression  treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  Physical Examination:  - Vital Signs: On physical examination  she was found to have a blood pressure of 170/95 mmHg  pulse of 110 beats per minute  a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  temperature of 98.4 °F (36.9 °C)  and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. - General Inspection: She appeared anxious and in distress. - No signs of heart failure were initially evident.  Investigations:  - ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.  - Blood tests revealed a mildly elevated troponin level. - Coronary angiography was performed  which showed no significant coronary artery disease to explain the clinical presentation. - Echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved basal function  hence the diagnosis of TTC was made.  Treatment and Follow-up:  - The patient was started on beta-blocker therapy  ACE inhibitors  and was given aspirin to prevent cardiac remodeling and aspirin for prevention of thromboembolic events respectively.  - Along with this  the SSRIs she was using for her anxiety and depression were continued. - After a week  a repeat echocardiogram showed improvement in her left ventricular function.  - Subsequent follow-up visits over the next three months showed further improvement of the cardiomyopathy and resolution of her symptoms.  Conclusion:  This case reminds us that despite being less common  TTC should always be considered in the differential diagnosis for women  especially post-menopausal  presenting with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome  especially in the context of recent severe emotional stress. Appropriate investigations  diagnosis  and management can prevent complications and improve prognosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,83,Title: A Case Report: Post-menopausal Woman with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Induced by Acute Emotional Distress  Patient Profile The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian female residing in a suburban neighborhood in Chicago  Illinois. She is a widow  lives alone  and is retired  with a previous career as a primary school teacher. She is a non-smoker with a history of hypertension  for which she is on medication (Losartan 50mg daily). She does not have any known history of cardiac disease  and there are no known allergies. Her BMI is within the healthy range.  Clinical Presentation The patient was brought to the emergency room (ER) by her daughter  presenting with chest pain described as severe and crushing  rated 8/10  which started abruptly about two hours prior to her arrival. The pain radiated to her left arm  did not resolve with rest  and was accompanied by a sensation of tightness  mild difficulty in breathing  and nausea. There was no accompanying diaphoresis  palpitations  or syncope. She reported an episode of severe emotional stress a few hours before the onset of pain as she had learned about the sudden death of her close friend.  Clinical Examination and Diagnostics On presentation  patient’s vitals were stable. Physical examination was unremarkable except for mild discomfort. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST- elevations in the precordial leads (V2-V4). Blood test revealed elevated Troponin I levels at 4.3 ng/ml  and a slightly elevated white blood cell count. A transthoracic echocardiography and coronary angiography were performed. The echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning with preserved basal function  typical of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiography showed no significant occlusion or stenosis  ruling out coronary artery disease.  Diagnosis Based on the clinical presentation  ECG findings suggestive of acute myocardial infarction  echocardiographic findings of apical ballooning  negative coronary angiography  and the preceding emotional stress  the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome).  Treatment and Progress Given the diagnosis  the patient was managed conservatively with supportive care including beta blockers (Metoprolol). Within a week  the patient showed significant improvement; her chest pain resolved  troponin levels normalized  and a repeat echocardiogram showed resolution of the apical ballooning with improved left ventricular function. After a brief admission period  she was discharged in stable condition with a prescription for Metoprolol  and follow-up appointments with a cardiologist were scheduled.  Conclusion This case exemplifies how emotional stress can trigger Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  especially in post-menopausal women. Health providers should have a high index of suspicion in this demographic presenting with chest pain emerging after emotional stress  even with no history of cardiac disease. This timely intervention can facilitate appropriate treatment and prevent complications.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,84,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-Year Old Female: A Case Report  Introduction: This report describes the case of a 68-year old African American female with a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  a codition also often referred to as """"broken heart syndrome.”  Case Presentation: The patient presented to the emergency department of our university hospital with complaints of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. She was a non-smoker  mild occasional drinker  with a past medical history significant only for hypertension which was controlled with lisinopril.  Symptom onset was sudden and occurred while she was attending her granddaughter's funeral  a highly emotional event for her. Initial examination and vitals showed blood pressure at 150/95 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed an alert  anxious woman with profuse sweating. No significant abnormalities were noted on cardiovascular  respiratory and abdominal examination.  Electrocardiogram on admittance showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads which raised suspicion for acute myocardial infarction. However  cardiac biomarkers (troponin levels) were only moderately elevated  not typical for a myocardial infarction. A transthoracic echocardiogram was immediately performed which showed apical balooning with preserved basal function  characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management and Outcome: The patient was initially treated as an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) case with dual antiplatelet therapy  statins and beta-blockers. After the diagnosis was clarified to be takotsubo cardiomyopathy  her management was revisited. Her heart failure symptoms were managed with diuretics. Ongoing emotional distress and anxiety were addressed with a consultation to the hospital physician and psychologist.  The patient remained stable throughout hospitalization and demonstrated improvement in symptoms over the next 5 days. A follow-up echocardiogram performed 10 days later showed complete resolution of the previous apical ballooning.   Conclusion: The present case illustrates a typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy induced by emotional stress and coexisting hypertension  which is more common in postmenopausal women. Clinicians should be aware of TCM as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain  especially in the context of recent emotional stress.  Key Learning Points: Severe emotional stress can trigger Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition mimicking myocardial infarction  with regards to symptomatology and ECG changes but lacking the degree of cardiac enzyme elevation typically seen in acute MI. Management primarily involves treatment of heart failure symptoms and addressing any potential triggers such as ongoing emotional distress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,85,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in an Elderly Female Following Emotional Stress: A Case Report  Abstract: This case report outlines an instance of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a 78-year-old Hispanic female following an episode of extreme emotional stress. Her presentation  diagnostic findings  treatment  and outcomes are presented and discussed with reference to the medical literature.  Case Presentation:  The patient  a 78-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of type II diabetes and hypertension  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain (8/10 on the pain scale)  shortness of breath  and nausea. Her symptoms started following the news of her grandchild being involved in a severe motor vehicle accident.  On examination  the patient appeared anxious and sweaty  and her vital signs showed a blood pressure of 170/90 mmHg  heart rate of 115 beats/min  respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The remainder of the physical exam was non-contributory. Given the suspicion for myocardial ischemia  an electrocardiogram (ECG) was immediately obtained  revealing ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads  suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome.  Initial blood work revealed slightly elevated troponin levels at 0.9 ng/mL (normal range = 0.00-0.04 ng/mL)  but normal complete blood count  electrolytes  and coagulation parameters. An emergency coronary angiography was undertaken to further investigate the suspected acute coronary syndrome. The angiography exhibited no obstructive coronary artery disease but showed a strikingly abnormal left ventricular contraction pattern; there appeared to be apical ballooning with hypercontraction of the cardiac base  a pattern characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  The patient was admitted for close monitoring and supportive care  including beta-blocker therapy  ACE inhibitors  and anti-anxiety medication  as there is no specific treatment for takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient experienced a stable hospital course and reported significant alleviation of symptoms over the ensuing 48 hours. A repeat echocardiogram prior to discharge demonstrated significant improvement in left ventricular function.  Discussion and Conclusion: This case represents an instance of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome """" a condition typically triggered by severe emotional stress and predominantly affecting post-menopausal women. The etiology of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not well-understood  but proposed mechanisms include catecholamine-induced myocardial stunning and coronary artery spasm.   Our patient's case echoes the demographic trends reported in the literature with the disorder chiefly affecting older women and frequently precipitated by stress. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care  with most patients demonstrating substantial improvement in cardiac function within weeks. This case emphasizes the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome  particularly in the context of recent severe emotional stress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,86,Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 57-year-old Female Patient Following a Severe Emotional Event  Patient Information: A 57-year-old Caucasian female presented to the Emergency Department with severe chest pain and dyspnea.  Medical History: The patient had a history of hypertension controlled with lisinopril 20 mg daily. She has never smoked  and there is no known history of illicit drug use or alcohol misuse. She had no known allergies. Her family history was negative for cardiovascular diseases  but her mother had died of lung cancer at the age of 62.  Presenting Complaint: The patient described the chest pain as a severe  crushing sensation  which began following a heated argument with her son. The pain was radiating to her left arm and was associated with intense sweating and palpitations. She had never experienced such pain before.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. She was hemodynamically stable  blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  but she had tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm. Cardiac auscultation revealed no murmurs  rubs or gallops. Her respiratory rate was slightly elevated at 24 breaths per minute  but her lungs were clear on auscultation.  Diagnostic Assessment: Her initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads  raising concerns for an acute coronary syndrome. But her cardiac biomarkers were only slightly elevated. An emergent coronary angiogram did not show any significant obstructive coronary artery disease. Left ventriculogram  however  showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with basal hyperkinesis  consistent with a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM). Echocardiogram confirmed reduced ejection fraction (40%)  with hypo- to akinesia of the apical and middle segments of the left ventricle.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit where she was managed conservatively with aspirin  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and statins. She was also referred to a clinical psychologist for management of her stress and anxiety.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  During a one-month follow-up visit  the patient reported a significant improvement in her symptoms. A repeat echocardiogram showed restoration of her left ventricular function  with an ejection fraction of 58%  with no significant segmental wall motion abnormalities. She was encouraged to continue with her antihypertensive treatment and psychological counselling.  Conclusion: This case illustrates that TCM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any postmenopausal woman presenting with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome after an intense emotional or physical stressor. The absence of coronary artery disease on angiography and the presence of transient left ventricular apical ballooning are key to establishing the diagnosis. Early recognition and supportive treatment are crucial for optimal patient outcomes.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,87,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Introduction:  The patient is a 68-year-old Latino woman named Mrs. Garcia  originating from Mexico  now living in the United States. She was admitted to Saint Alexander Hospital for chest pains mimicking a heart attack. Her medical history was significant for hypertension and type II diabetes. Her familial history includes her mother  who died of ischemic heart disease at the age of 71  and her sister who was diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia.   Presentation:  Mrs. Garcia presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain occurring after an intense argument with her neighbor. Symptomatically  she described the pain as sharp  8 out of 10  radiating to her left arm and jaw  associated with shortness of breath  and cold sweats. She denied any other neurological  gastrointestinal  or respiratory symptoms. There was no recent travel  significant trauma or interpersonal violence.  Investigation:  Her initial vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 170/94 mmHg  heart rate of 88 beats/minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute  oxygen saturation of 97% on room air  and temperature of 98.6 °F. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior and inferolateral leads. Her chest X-ray was within normal limits  and reduced left ventricular systolic function with apical ballooning with hyperkinesia of the basal walls was observed through Echocardiography - findings consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Cardiac biomarkers were increased with troponin T at 1.8 ng/mL (normal: <0.1 ng/mL) and creatine kinase-MB of 56 U/L (normal: <5 U/L). Other laboratory tests  including full blood count  electrolyte panel  and liver function tests were within normal ranges.   Management:  Given the patient's clinical presentation and significant cardiovascular risk factors  a treatment regimen of aspirin  beta-blocker  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and statins was initiated immediately. Through the course of management  her blood pressure normalized and her chest pain subsided.  Outcome and Follow-Up:  After intensive treatment and careful monitoring  the patient's symptoms had shown significant improvement by the third day of admission. Mrs. Garcia was discharged under the care of her daughter with instructions for close outpatient follow-up. A follow-up echocardiogram 8 weeks later reported normalized left ventricular function  indicating good recovery.  Conclusion:  This case highlights that TCM  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" has a clinical presentation that is strikingly similar to acute coronary syndrome  and it is usually associated with emotional or physical stressors. Given its increasing incidence  it is crucial for clinicians to recognize and manage this acute heart failure syndrome to improve patient outcomes. The suspected etiology in Mrs. Garcia's case is extreme emotional stress  caused by a heated argument with her neighbor. Prompt recognition and supportive care has led to good recovery in Mrs. Garcia's case."

Medical and Family History: The patient’s medical history showed a controlled type II diabetes mellitus and mild hypertension  being monitored with medication. She had a negative history for coronary artery disease or any prior heart conditions. The patient is post-menopausal and had a family history of heart disease in her late father. She reported no recent stressful or emotional events.  Diagnostic Assessment: The high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I level was significantly increased; however  the ECG suggested non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The coronary angiogram did not reveal any significant stenosis  ruling out acute coronary syndrome. Importantly  the left ventriculography exhibited a typical apical ballooning of the heart with decreased ejection fraction  resembling the shape of a “takotsubo” that confirmed Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and managed conservatively with supportive therapy consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I)  beta-blockers  and anticoagulants. Close monitoring of cardiac telemetry was maintained to prevent arrhythmias.  Outcome: The patient experienced an uneventful hospital recovery and was discharged with outpatient follow-up plans with the cardiology department. The follow-up echocardiogram showed improvement in the left ventricular function and normalization of the cardiac biomarkers.  Discussion:  This case emphasizes that TCM should be contemplated as a possible differential diagnosis in a menopausal  African-American woman presenting with acute chest pain and dyspnea. Even though TCM is often caused by intense emotional stress  it could present spontaneously  as in our case report. Despite the lack of epidemiological data on racial predominance  this case highlights the occurrence of TCM in the African-American population  which is under-represented in the current literature.  Key Learning Points: - TCM can mimic acute coronary syndrome and can present even in patients with no recent stressful events. - Even though TCM is commonly found in post-menopausal women  it can occur in an under-represented demographic cohort  such as African American women. - In patients presenting with symptoms indicative of acute NSTEMI with a negative angiogram  TCM should be contemplated as a differential diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,89,Title: Acute Onset of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Female: A Case Report  Presentation:  A 65-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department (ED) experiencing severe chest pain. On the onset of symptoms  the patient described the pain as a sudden 'crushing' sensation in the center of her chest  which radiated to her left arm and jaw. The patient was in apparent distress  agitated  and profusely sweating. She also reported a feeling of shortness of breath.   Background:  The patient is a retired teacher  a widow living alone  and a nonsmoker. She has three adult children. She has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both controlled with medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin  respectively). She also has a history of anxiety disorder  for which she is currently not taking any medication. She does not have any known drug allergies. She consumes alcohol sparingly and has no history of substance abuse. Several weeks before her ED admission  her son revealed he was moving abroad  a situation the patient described as deeply distressing.  Investigations and Clinical Findings:  Upon arrival  a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was promptly performed showing T-wave inversion and ST-segment elevation  mimicking an acute myocardial infarction. However  the patient's Troponin levels were only mildly elevated. Urgent coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery stenosis  but ventriculography depicted apical ballooning  a hallmark of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). A later echocardiogram confirmed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesia of the apical segments and hyperkinesia of the basal segments  consistent with TTC.  Diagnosis:  The patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome)  a rare form of temporary heart condition often triggered by excessive stress. The classic signs of TTC  coupled with the patient's emotional stressor (her son moving overseas)  confirmed the diagnosis.  Management and Follow-up:  The patient was managed in the acute phase with standard heart failure medication  including an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor  beta-blocker  and aspirin. Once stable  she was offered counseling to help cope with her emotional stress. At 4-week follow-up  the patient reported diminished chest pain and anxiety levels. Repeat echocardiography showed complete resolution of the previous wall motion abnormalities  and ECG changes were normalizing.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the relevance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in postmenopausal women presenting with chest pain in the setting of emotional stress. Early recognition  an appropriate diagnosis of TTC followed by prompt treatment can significantly improve prognosis and outcomes in these patients.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,90,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-menopausal African-American Female: A Case Study  Patient Introduction: The patient  a 64-year-old postmenopausal African-American female  presented at the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath followed by sporadic chest pain. Detailed medical history revealed that the patient was a lifelong non-smoker and had been struggling  albeit sporadically  with Hypertension for the past eight years. The patient did not have a family or personal history of cardiac disease and was not taking any specific medication for her hypertension  maintaining her blood pressure mainly through dietary modifications and regular exercise. This presentation was an isolated episode  with the patient never having experienced such symptoms before.  Clinical Findings: Upon admission  the patient appeared anxious with pain over the left sternal border. The EKG imaging showed ST-segment elevation which seconds myocardial Infarction. However  the Troponin-I level was relatively low considering the EKG changes  which showed 0.7 ng/mL (normal range is up to 0.04 ng/mL). Further Hematology panel findings showed Hemoglobin at 12.5 g/dL  WBC at 7200 cells/mm3  Platelets at 258 X 109/L  and a Na/K ratio of 137/3.9 mEq/L. Additionally  the fasting lipid profile was noted to be within normal limits.   Diagnosis: Considering the patient's clinical presentation and investigation findings  an urgent coronary angiogram was performed  which showed no atherosclerotic coronary artery disease  ruling out myocardial infarction. Left ventriculography  however  showed apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basal walls – findings indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC).   Treatment and Progress: The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) under the presumptive diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). She was immediately started on supportive treatment  including oxygen via a nasal cannula  nitrates  low dose beta-blockers  aspirin  and clopidogrel. Her chest pain and dyspnea improved significantly over the next 48-hour period.  During her stay  she was fully educated on the nature of her disease and that emotional stress could be a potential trigger for the same. On enquiring  she mentioned that she had recently lost her elder sister  which had left her emotionally distressed.   In light of the new findings  the need for psychiatric counseling was stressed and arrangements were done for follow-ups. On the third day of admission  she was discharged in stable condition with a prescription for low-dose beta-blockers and was scheduled for an outpatient follow-up after a week.  Conclusion: This case highlights TTC as a significant differential in post-menopausal women presenting with chest pain and marked EKG changes  especially in the absence of significant coronary occlusion. It also underscores the importance of awareness of stress-induced cardiomyopathy among healthcare providers. Effective management comprises of early diagnosis  supportive treatment  and addressing emotional stress if any.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,91,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman Following Emotional Stress  Case Introduction: A 68-year-old African American woman presented to our emergency department with severe chest pain. She described the pain as a sudden sharp  pressing sensation in her chest that started a few hours earlier.  Patient Information: The patient is a retired teacher  widowed  and lives alone. She has been previously healthy  with a past medical history suggestive of hypertension and osteoporosis  controlled well with Amlodipine and Alendronate  respectively. She has regular follow-ups with her primary care physician every six months and is compliant with her medications.  Clinical Findings: She was in significant distress  perspiring profusely but oriented towards time place and person. Her vitals on presentation were: Blood pressure 145/85 mmHg  Pulse 110 beats per minute  Respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  Temperature 36.8°C  and Oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal S1 and S2 but no additional heart sounds or murmurs were detected. Pulmonary auscultation was unremarkable  and the remainder of the physical examination was essentially normal.  Timeline: The patient complained about a sudden immense emotional stress she experienced a day before due to the death of her close friend. Since then  she had been feeling anxious and restless  followed by the onset of the chest pain.  Diagnostic Assessment: The EKG showed marked ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads. Cardiac markers (troponin) were significantly elevated. Echocardiogram revealed an akinetic apical and mid segments with hyperkinesis of the basal segments  also known as 'apical ballooning'. Coronary angiography was performed  which showed no significant coronary artery disease  ruling out a myocardial infarction.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was treated with supportive management including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and anxiolytics  reflecting a similar approach to that used in managing patients with acute coronary syndrome.  Follow-up and Outcome: Over a course of a week  the patient's chest pain resolved completely with the normalization of cardiac markers. A repeat echocardiogram showed a normalization of left ventricular function with no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was discharged in stable condition.  Discussion: This case demonstrates an instance of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'Broken Heart Syndrome'  often triggered by severe stress. The syndrome typically presents in postmenopausal women  reflecting the demographics of our patient.  Conclusion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  although infrequent  should be considered in differential diagnoses in patients  particularly postmenopausal women presenting with chest pain following periods of significant emotional stress. Early identification and supportive management can lead to complete recovery.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,92,Title: Atypical Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Middle-Aged African American Male With No Prior Cardiac History  Abstract: An unexpected case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  or broken-heart syndrome  presented in an otherwise healthy 52-year-old African American male with no prior cardiac history. The case underlines the importance of considering TTC in the diagnostic process concerning acute chest pain  even in the absence of typical triggers.   Case Report:  A 52-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department complaining of acute onset chest pain  dyspnea  and diaphoresis. He described the pain as “tearing” and scored it 8/10 on the pain scale  with the discomfort radiating to his left arm. The pain came on suddenly whilst he was at rest. The patient’s past medical history was significant for controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He had no known history of cardiac disease  no recent surgeries  no known drug allergies  and his only medications were metformin and lisinopril.  Upon physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and was diaphoretic but was not in acute respiratory distress. Initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respirations of 20 per minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rhythm with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.   Laboratory results showed a slightly elevated troponin level of 0.06 ng/mL (normal: <0.02 ng/mL)  a normal complete blood count  electrolytes  and renal function. Electrocardiogram displayed sinus tachycardia with minor ST-elevation in the anterior leads  prompting concern for an acute coronary syndrome.  Further investigation via coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease. However  left ventriculogram portrayed a clear apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesis  consistent with the diagnosis of TTC. The patient was admitted to our cardiology unit for closer monitoring. A beta-blocker was initiated  and his angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was continued. The patient was counseled on stress management techniques.  At the one-week follow-up  he reported the complete resolution of chest pain and his ECG showed a normalized ST-segment. An echo performed at the three-month follow-up also depicted complete restoration of the left ventricular function. The patient has since remained asymptomatic and continues to engage in therapeutic stress management practices.  Conclusion: This case report serves to underscore the importance of recognizing TTC as a potential differential in patients presenting with chest pain  even in the absence of typical triggers or populations. This is pertinent  particularly in populations such as middle-aged African American males  where such presentations may not be as common or well-studied  thereby potentially leading to under-diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,93,Title: Late-Onset Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Hispanic Female Patient   Patient Description: The patient is a 75-year-old Hispanic female from Southern California referred to the emergency department due to severe chest pain following distressing news about her daughter's health. She resides alone and is a retired elementary school teacher. Her weight and height measurements are within normal ranges  although she self-reports a history of intermittent hypertension  for which she takes Lisinopril (10mg daily)  and She has no noteworthy allergies  immunizations are up-to-date  and has a moderate exercise routine.  Past Medical History: The patient has no prior history of cardiovascular disease or psychiatric disorders. She battled and successfully overcame breast cancer 15 years ago and has remained cancer-free since then. The patient is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She maintains a balanced diet  exercises regularly and reports no illicit drug use. Her mother passed away from a heart attack at age 79.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient presented absolutely intense chest pain following an emotionally distressing phone call regarding her daughter's health. She described her pain as a heavy  crushing pressure in her chest radiating to her left arm. She also reported shortness of breath  extreme fatigue  light-headedness  and anxiety.  Clinical Findings: On examination  patient was conscious  but visibly distressed. Vital signs included a pulse of 110 bpm  respirations at 18 breaths/minute  blood pressure at 165/90 mm/Hg  and oxygen saturation at 95% on room air. Initial bloodwork showed slightly elevated troponin levels. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevations. An echocardiogram showed apical ballooning and depressed ejection fraction (40%) suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM).   Diagnosis: Given her clinical presentation  past medical history and the emotional stress preceding her chest pain  patient was diagnosed with TCM  commonly known as Broken Heart Syndrome  a condition frequently triggered by severe stress and causing dysfunction of the heart's left ventricle.  Treatment and Follow-Up: She was initially managed with aspirin  beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. Therapeutic relaxation techniques were also incorporated into her plan of care to manage her stress levels. At discharge  the patient's medications included Lisinopril (10mg)  Metoprolol (50mg) and a daily baby aspirin. She was referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation  treatment  and follow-up. After 3 months  she returned for a follow-up visit and reported significant improvement with no recurring chest pain episodes. Repeat Echocardiogram showed improved ejection fraction (55%).  This case underscores the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of postmenopausal women presenting with chest pain  particularly in stressful situations. The involvement of a specialist and supportive therapies can prove significant in the patient's recovery and overall health outcomes.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,94,Title: Acute Onset of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-Year-Old Female Following Emotional Turmoil  Case Report:  Patient Information:  We present a case of a 68-year-old Caucasian female  a retired school teacher  with a high level of daily stress due to the recent unexpected death of her husband. She lives alone and has two daughters who live out of state. She denies any alcohol  tobacco  or recreational drug use. Her BMI is within normal ranges  and she has no history of sudden weight changes.  Presenting Problem: Patient arrived at the emergency department manifesting symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. The symptoms had been developing over the course of two days following her husband's funeral. She also reported anxiousness  aches  generalized weakness  and lightheadedness.  No history of trauma or injury was reported.  Past Medical History: Patient's past medical history reveals well-controlled hypertension  under management for the past 10 years. She has been consistent with her antihypertensive medication  Lisinopril 20 mg once daily. No other known illnesses  surgeries  or injuries were reported. She is not under any other prescription or over-the-counter medications  and she has no known drug allergies. Her family history revealed no cardiovascular or congenital conditions.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination displayed elevated blood pressure (160/95 mmHg)  tachycardia (115 bpm)  normal temperature  and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Initial Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed non-specific ST-segment elevation  suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. The echocardiogram reported significantly reduced ejection fraction of 35%  with apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesis  the classic 'octopus pot' sign. Blood laboratory results displayed a slight increase in cardiac troponin level  which is unusual for a suspected myocardial infarction.   Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical findings and the aspect of emotional stress trigger  a strong suspicion for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome) was considered. Coronary angiography confirmed the diagnosis by ruling out obstructive coronary artery disease.  Therapeutic Intervention: She was initiated on β-blockers  angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and moderate doses of an anxiety-reducing medication  as a part of the conservative management. The patient was admitted to the cardiac unit for monitoring.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: Following a week of hospital stay  she reported improvements in symptoms. Repeat echocardiogram revealed normalization of the left ventricle function  with the ejection fraction improving to 55%. She was advised to continue medications and seek counseling for dealing with emotional stress. Regular cardiac follow-ups were scheduled.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed relief upon knowing that her heart condition was transient and possibly reversible. She consented to engage with a psychologist to manage her emotional stress and grief better.  Take-Away: This case underscores the importance of recognizing Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  often mimicking a heart attack  especially in postmenopausal women following significant emotional stress. Emotional stress management and counseling should be considered an integral part of the treatment regimen in such cases.  Full Ethical Approval: The report was prepared following all ethical guidelines  with informed patient consent for data utilization for academic and teaching purposes while maintaining her anonymity.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,95,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy following Emotional Stress in a 68-Year-Old Female Patient   Case Report:  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome  is an acute and usually reversible heart condition that mimics acute coronary syndrome. We report a case of a 68-year-old woman who presented with symptoms identical to myocardial infarction following a highly stressful event but was eventually diagnosed with TTC.  Patient Information: The patient  Mrs. A  is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  widowed with two adult children. She has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  medicated with amlodipine and atorvastatin respectively.  Clinical Findings: Mrs. A presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe substernal chest pain radiating to her left arm. The symptoms began after she received news of her son being critically injured in a car accident. She also reported accompanying symptoms of shortness of breath  nausea  and palpitations.  Diagnostic Assessment: Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation  suggesting an acute coronary syndrome  and elevated troponin levels were found. However  the patient's coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries  not consistent with the initial diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Her echocardiogram showed a reduced ejection fraction of 35% and apical ballooning of the left ventricle  which are indicative of TTC.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was provided with supportive care  including beta-blockers and an ACE inhibitor  to manage heart failure. Anxiolytic treatment was also given to help reduce anxiety.  Follow Up and Outcomes: With proper medical management and supportive counseling  Mrs. A's cardiac function improved significantly over 2 months – the ejection fraction returned to 60% and the ventricular-ballooning pattern disappeared. Her symptoms of chest pain and breathlessness also resolved. Subsequent follow-ups every three months have shown the patient is maintaining good cardiac function and overall health.  Conclusion: This case demonstrates the classic presentation of TTC  emphasizing that emotional stress can act as a trigger  and its diagnostic features closely mimic those of acute coronary syndrome. Early recognition  efficient diagnosis  and appropriate treatment with psychological support can improve clinical outcomes in patients presenting with TTC.  Note: This case study is simulated and doesn't portray a real patient or event.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,96,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following Emotional Stress: A Case Report  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) also known as stress cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome)  is a transient left ventricular dysfunction associated with severe emotional or physical stress. Predominantly affecting postmenopausal women  its key feature is an apical ballooning pattern on ventriculogram. TTC is typically reversible and the prognosis is usually favorable  however  complications can occur.  Case Presentation:  Patient Information:  A 72-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain following the sudden loss of her spouse. She lived alone and was retired after a long career as a primary school teacher. She was a non-smoker and had limited alcohol use.  Clinical Findings: Upon presentation  the patient had severe chest pain  described as 'crushing'. Vital signs were stable with blood pressure of 142/88mmHg  heart rate of 96bpm  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Cardiovascular examination was normal with no murmur  rub or gallop.  Past Medical History:  The patient’s past medical history included hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which were managed with hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin  respectively. She had experienced occasional episodes of palpitations for a few years  but workups  including stress tests and echocardiography  had previously returned normal.  Diagnostic Assessment: The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads I  II  and avL. Initial cardiac biomarkers showed elevated troponin I level at 2.5ng/ml (normal <0.04ng/ml). A Coronary angiography was performed which ruled out significant coronary artery disease. Left ventriculogram revealed 'apical ballooning' with hyperdynamic basal segments and hypokinesis of mid and apical segments. The patient's symptoms  ECG changes  elevated cardiac biomarkers  and characteristic ventriculogram led to the diagnosis of TTC.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was treated with aspirin  low molecular weight heparin  and a beta-blocker (metoprolol). Physical and emotional stress management strategies were also provided.   Follow-up Outcome: Repeat cardiac imaging after two months showed complete resolution of ventricular dysfunction and normalization of cardiac biomarkers. The patient reported no subsequent chest pain and confirmed successful coping strategies to manage stress.  Conclusion:  This case highlights takotsubo cardiomyopathy's association with emotional stress. It is important for clinicians to recognize TTC  especially in elderly women presenting with chest pain following a significant emotional stressor  as the management differs significantly from the standard treatment of acute coronary syndrome. Stress management strategies alongside appropriate cardiac medication should be considered in these patients to prevent recurrence of the event.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,97,CASE REPORT: TAKOTSUBO CARDIOMYOPATHY  Patient Information: A 68 year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher  married  residing in the suburban town of Vermont presented with severe chest pain in the emergency department of our tertiary care hospital.  Medical History: The patient's past medical history revealed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  well managed with Metformin and diet control for the past 8 years. The patient was on regular yearly cardiology check-ups  with reports of normal cardiac health. She has no previous history of cardiac disease or heart attack but has familial history of heart diseases. The patient is a non-smoker and maintained moderate weekly alcohol use.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  she had elevated blood pressure (155/85 mmHg)  tachycardia with a heart rate of around 110 beats per minute  and respiration was slightly labored. There was no loss of consciousness  no radiating pain  and no tingling sensation in her extremities. During the examination  she revealed that she had experienced sudden  intense emotional stress related to the unexpected death of her husband.  Diagnostic Focus  Assessment  and Plan: Electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed immediately  which exhibited ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  mimicking the symptoms of myocardial infarction. However  no significant cardiac enzyme elevation was found. An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe hypokinesis of the apical and mid segments of the left ventricle with systolic apical ballooning and hypercontractility of the basal segments  which are typical features of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management: The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit and was treated conservatively with beta-blockers (Metoprolol)  ACE inhibitors (Lisinopril)  and diuretics (Lasix). She was also provided with supportive care  which included bed rest  oxygenation  and nutrition.   Follow-up and Outcome: Following treatment  the patient reported a significant reduction in chest pain. After a one-week hospital stay  a follow-up echocardiogram indicated near-normalization of the left ventricular function. Counselling for stress management was also conducted. She was advised to continue her medications and regular monitoring.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed a great deal of surprise upon knowing that intense emotional stress could result in such a severe cardiac event. She is now recovering and is gracious for the early diagnosis and treatment.  Informed Consent: Patient’s consent was taken for publication about the case with assurance of anonymity.  CONCLUDING REMARKS:  This case highlights the fact that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can often be misdiagnosed as Acute Coronary Syndrome due to its similar symptomology. Prompt diagnosis and management can lead to rapid recovery in most cases. It also emphasizes that emotional stress can be a potent trigger for cardiac incidents in patients with predisposing factors  thus making psychosocial support an important aspect of holistic patient care.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,98,Patient Description  A 67-year-old African American female presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain  fatigue  and shortness of breath. The patient was in her usual state of health until these symptoms started suddenly earlier in the day.  Medical History  The patient's past medical history includes hypertension  which has been under control with medication  and type 2 diabetes  managed with diet and oral hypoglycemic agents. The patient also is post-menopausal with no current hormone replacement therapy. She does not smoke  drinks alcohol occasionally  and has no family history of heart disease. The patient is a retired school teacher who lives with her husband and is relatively active in her community.  Clinical Presentation  Physical examination revealed normal BP of 130/82  heart rate 110/min  temperature 98.6°F  and respiratory rate 30/min. Her oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed regular rhythm with no audible murmurs. Lungs were clear to auscultation  and other examinations were normal.  Diagnosis and Treatment  Initial EKG demonstrated ST-segment elevation on anterior leads. Troponin-T was elevated at 1.5 ng/ ml. With suspicion of an acute myocardial infarction (MI)  the patient was immediately referred for a coronary angiography. Unexpectedly  the coronary angiogram showed normal coronary arteries.   The left ventriculography showed apical ballooning with preserved basal function  characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as broken heart syndrome. Brain natriuretic peptide was also raised at 1300 pg/mL (normal range <100 pg/mL)  confirming the presence of heart failure.  Notably  the patient had experienced a major stressful event recently. Just two days before her admission  she had the sudden death of her close friend.   The patient was managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics. Within four days of treatment  her symptoms improved significantly.   Discussion  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a transient cardiac syndrome that involves left ventricular apical akinesis and mimics acute coronary syndrome. It predominantly affects postmenopausal women and is often preceded by a stressful event. Despite the striking changes in cardiac structure and function  the prognosis is generally favorable with appropriate therapy.  In this case  the history of emotional stress  clinical presentation of chest pain  ST-segment elevation on EKG  absence of obstructive coronary disease  and the characteristic finding of left ventricular apical ballooning on ventriculography confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  This case still presents a knowledge gap about the pathophysiology and treatment of this disease. Therefore  we encourage further research to improve the patient's management and bridge this gap in future care.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,99,Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Female: Clinical Presentation and Therapeutic Management   Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium. This condition often affects post-menopausal women and is commonly triggered by severe emotional distress.  Case Presentation:   Patient Information and Clinical Findings  A 62-year old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations  symptoms that were suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient began experiencing these symptoms around two hours prior to arrival at the ED. She reported a significant stressful event happened the previous day. She has a history of hypertension  controlled by medication  with no history of cardiovascular disease  smoking  illicit drug usage  or alcohol misuse.   Diagnostic Assessment  An electrocardiogram (ECG) was immediately conducted  showing ST-segment elevations in the anterior precordial leads (V2 through V4). Cardiac enzyme studies showed slightly elevated troponin levels  inconsistent with the observed ECG changes. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed left ventricular ballooning with hypokinesis in the apical and mid-ventricular segments  but hyperkinesis in the basal segments  a presentation typical of TTC rather than myocardial infarction.   Coronary angiography was performed to rule out ACS  which revealed patent coronary arteries with no significant stenosis. The left ventriculography confirmed the earlier findings from the TTE.   With clinical  ECG  and imaging findings  and after excluding ACS  the patient was consequently diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Therapeutic Interventions and Follow-Up  The patient was managed supportively with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers  in addition to psychological support to help alleviate the stressor. Over the course of several days  her symptoms alleviated gradually. A follow-up echocardiography after three weeks showed near-complete resolution of the previously noted wall motion abnormalities. Continuation of medical therapy and regular close follow-ups were advised.  Conclusion  TTC often poses a diagnostic challenge  given its mimicry of ACS. Careful consideration of demographic details  circumstantial stressors  and an atypical mismatch of ECG changes and cardiac enzymes can provide vital clues. Early recognition  appropriate diagnostic workup  and supportive therapeutic intervention can considerably improve outcomes in such cases.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,7,100,"Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal African American Woman  Patient Description:   The patient is a 68-year-old African American woman  presenting to the emergency department complaining of severe stabbing chest pain since the previous night. She lives alone and is a retired schoolteacher. She is a known case of hypertension  managed with medication for the last 15 years. She also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents for 8 years. She is a non-smoker  consumes alcohol occasionally  and denies illicit drug use.  Background Information:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as apical ballooning syndrome or """"broken heart syndrome""""  is a transient cardiac syndrome characterized by severe left ventricular dysfunction. This condition mimics the coronary artery disease and is often precipitated by severe stress. It predominantly affects postmenopausal women.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  her blood pressure was 155/95 mm Hg  pulse rate was regular at 105 bpm  and responsible to stress. Her respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. An initial EKG showed ST segment elevation in the anterior precordial leads (V1-V4). The cardiac troponin level was significantly elevated (2.34ng/mL  0-0.4ng/mL). Given these findings  the patient was initially suspected of having an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However  coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery stenosis.  Treatment Course:  The patient was subsequently diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy based on the distinctive finding of apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesis on left ventriculography. She was commenced on beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors  and her symptom of chest pain subsided gradually over the following days. Over the course of a week  cardiac functions improved to almost normal  confirmed by repeat echocardiography.  Follow-up and Prognosis:  During her follow-up visits  the patient remained asymptomatic and her cardiac function remained stable. Despite the severe initial presentation  takotsubo cardiomyopathy often has a favorable prognosis with appropriate management and close monitoring.   Concluding Remarks:  This case highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis in patients  especially postmenopausal women  presenting with chest pain and EKG changes suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. Despite its dramatic initial presentation  the recovery from takotsubo cardiomyopathy is usually rapid and complete with appropriate medical therapy. "

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,1,Case Presentation:  Patient Information:  The patient is a 59-year-old Caucasian female named Jane Franklin who is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She is widowed  lives alone  and has a bachelor's degree. She is employed as a high-school teacher and is currently living in Manhattan  New York.  Presenting Complaint:  Jane presented in the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain  similar to 'heartburn'  together with shortness of breath. These symptoms started suddenly when she was at her son's wedding.  Medical History:  Jane has a history of well-controlled hypertension. She also has an 8-year history of major depressive disorder. Her only medication is Lisinopril for hypertension. There is no history of diabetes  asthma  or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Family History:  Her father passed away at the age of 65 due to myocardial infarction. Her mother (aged 83  alive) suffers from osteoporosis. There is no known familial cardiac disorder.  Investigations: Her EKG showed a ST-elevation in the precordial leads suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome  but her troponin levels were within normal limits. An emergency angiognam displayed no obstructive coronary artery disease. However  echocardiography revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal walls  leading to the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Hospital Course:  Her blood pressure and heart rate were stabilized. She was started on a beta-blocker (Metoprolol) and ACE inhibitor therapy. Her chest pain gradually subsided over the next few days.  Conclusion and Follow-Up: Jane was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome' instigated  possibly  by the emotional stress of her son's wedding. Regular follow-ups were scheduled to monitor her condition. Further counseling was advised for her major depressive disorder.  Case Discussion: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is known as a cardiac response to acute emotional stress. Jane's major depressive disorder and the emotional stress at her son's wedding may have precipitated this condition. Her case highlights the importance of considering TCM in differential diagnosis of acute chest pain  particularly in post-menopausal women with a recent history of emotional stress. It also emphasizes the potential need for added psychological support for patients with TCM.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,2,Patient Presentation:  Ms. J is a 78-year-old Caucasian woman  recently admitted to our cardiology center with complains of severe chest pain  fatigue  and shortness of breath. She has no significant past medical history of heart disease. Her medical record includes hypertension managed by beta-blockers and type II diabetes mellitus under control with Metformin. She is a non-smoker but does have a reported history of moderate alcohol consumption. There's no history of illicit drug use. Ms. J lives alone  her husband having passed away just a year ago; her two children live in another state. She recently nearly suffered an accidental house fire  which she found profoundly stressful.  Family history is significant for coronary artery disease in her late father and her mother died of a cerebrovascular accident (stroke).  Vital signs at presentation were within normal range although blood pressure was slightly elevated at 142/88 mmHg.  Examination  Diagnosis and Treatment:  Electrocardiography (EKG) revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads and moderate QT prolongation. The troponin-I levels were significantly high. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed apical ballooning with a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction at 35% suggesting a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken-heart syndrome)  commonly triggered by extreme emotional or physical stress.  To confirm the diagnosis  a coronary angiography was performed  which showed no significant coronary artery disease  notably ruling out an acute myocardial infarction. The diagnosis was finalized as takotsubo cardiomyopathy based on her symptoms  the EKG and echocardiogram findings  and the lack of significant coronary artery disease.  The patient was immediately given aspirin for its antiplatelet effects and started on an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to help minimize the effect on the heart's pumping ability. In addition  she was placed on a beta-blocker to help manage her blood pressure and reduce her heart rate. A psychiatrist consulted on her case to manage her grief and anxiety  as takotsubo cardiomyopathy is often triggered by acute emotional stress.  Follow-up and Prognosis:  Ms. J tolerated her treatment well and her symptoms improved significantly over the following week. She was discharged with a close follow-up plan. She would have frequent outpatient appointments  including sessions with a psychiatrist and a cardiologist  and an echocardiogram repeated after four weeks. She was also prescribed physical therapy to aid in her recovery and improve her overall physical health.  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically has a good prognosis with appropriate management  although it is crucial to monitor closely as the condition can occasionally lead to serious complications such as heart failure  arrhythmia  and stroke. With the continuing support of her children and an allocated home healthcare worker  Ms. J has a support system in place to help manage her physical and emotional wellbeing. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,3,Patient Case Presentation  Demographic Information:  Patient is a 68-year-old  post-menopausal African-American female. She lives with her husband of 45 years and is a retired school teacher. They reside in New York  United States. Her socio-economic status is average  as she and her husband live off their retirement savings and social security benefits.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension for which she takes Lisinopril 10 mg daily. Her blood pressure has been maintained between 120/65 and 130/70 for the past 5 years. She's also been monitoring her cholesterol levels and following a healthy diet. She is non-diabetic  has a BMI of 24  and does not smoke or consume alcohol.  Recent Medical History/ Present Illness:  The patient presented to the emergency room with acute onset of substernal chest pain and shortness of breath which began early in the morning. These symptoms followed an intense emotional discussion with her sibling the previous night. On arrival  her vitals were stable but she had a slightly raised troponin level. An emergency echocardiogram and cardiac angiogram were conducted to rule out a myocardial infarction.  Radiographic Findings:  The echocardiogram illustrated a moderate reduction in left ventricular systolic function  but cardiac angiogram did not show any signs of coronary artery disease. The absence of coronary artery disease  in combination with her triggering event  raised suspicions of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Family History:  The patient's father passed away at the age of 76 due to a myocardial infarction  and her mother  who is 88 years old  has a history of hypertension but is otherwise healthy. She has two older brothers  one of whom has Type II diabetes but no cardiovascular issues.  Diagnosis:  Considering her clinical picture  the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome. This diagnosis was supported by her recent emotionally stressful event and the absence of significant coronary artery disease.   Treatment:  The patient was started on a beta-blocker medication (metoprolol) and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor)  alongside her current prescriptions. She was also referred to a cardiologist for follow up  and a psychologist to help manage her emotional stress.   Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is typically triggered by extreme emotional and physical stress. It has been found to have a higher prevalence in post-menopausal women. There is no definitive treatment for this condition; rather  focus is placed on management of symptoms  underlying triggers  and prevention of recurrence. High-risk patients might benefit from long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers.   Prognosis:  The prognosis is generally favorable  with most patients experiencing complete recovery within weeks. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,4,Patient Profile:  Ms. D is a 68-year-old African American female who presented at the emergency clinic with a two-day history of severe  sharp  and radiating chest pain with dyspnea. She has a past medical history of hypertension that has been well managed with Lisinopril for past 6 years and a family history genus of type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has no significant history of smoking  alcohol use  respiratory disease  or mental health issues.   Case Presentation:  Approximately 72 hours prior to her ER visit  Ms. D experienced an emotionally traumatic event as she lost her younger sister to a prolonged battle with Multiple Sclerosis. The patient initially brushed off the chest pain attributing it to the stress and emotional turmoil she was facing. However  the increasing severity of the chest pain and onset of exhaustion and shortness of breath caused her to seek medical attention.  On presentation  her blood pressure was slightly elevated at 160/100 and cardiogram revealed ST-segment elevation  initially raising the suspicion of acute myocardial infarction. Laboratory tests showed moderately elevated cardiac troponin levels but her lipid profile was unremarkable.   She underwent an immediate coronary angiography which did not reveal any significant obstruction which ruled out coronary artery disease. Subsequent Echocardiography and ventriculography highlighted a reduced ejection fraction with apical 'ballooning' and basal hypercontractility. These findings were consistent with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  commonly known as Broken Heart Syndrome.   Ms. D was introduced to heart failure management including initiation on a beta-blocker  aspirin  ACE-inhibitors  and necessary psychotherapy support for her emotional health.  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a transient left ventricular dysfunction previously disregarded due to its rare occurrence. However  recent studies show that postmenopausal women  particularly those who are in the middle age group or older  are the most affected demographic  like Ms. D. This condition is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress  which in Ms. D's case was the grief she experienced with the loss of her sister.   Takotsubo's can easily be misdiagnosed as acute coronary syndrome but their distinct features often come out during cardiac imaging tests. Recovery from Takotsubo's is usually excellent with proper medical and psychological management. However  it's worth noting that recurrence is common  with stress management and emotional health being important aspects in the long-term care of these patients.  This case emphasizes the importance of considering Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis  particularly in postmenopausal women presenting with acute chest pain following physical or emotional stress. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,5,"Patient Profile: Patient's Name: Ms. Smith Age: 65 years Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired  Medical History: Ms. Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian female  presents to the emergency department experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath. She has a past medical history of hypertension managed by medications and anxiety disorder. She quit smoking twenty years ago and consumes alcohol socially.  Her mother had a MI at age 75. The patient is otherwise healthy  takes balanced nutrition  and exercises regularly.  Presenting Symptoms: The onset of signs and symptoms was sudden where she first felt a severe squeezing chest pain which extended to her left arm. Accompanying this pain  she became increasingly short of breath and started feeling nauseous.  Examination: On examination  the patient appeared distressed  with cold sweat. Her heart rate was recorded at 110 and blood pressure at 160/95. However  her BMI was within the normal range.  Investigations and Results: The ECG showed ST-elevation in anterior leads that mimicked an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). However  subsequent cardiac angiography ruled out any significant coronary artery disease. Echocardiogram showed apical ballooning with hyper contraction of the basal walls  findings consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken-heart syndrome).  Management Plan: Given the absence of significant coronary artery disease  the patient was managed conservatively with heart failure medications including ACE inhibitors  beta blockers  and diuretics. She was also placed on anxiolytics for her anxiety.  Outcome: After receiving treatment  the patient's condition stabilized  and her symptoms improved. A follow-up echocardiogram done eight weeks later demonstrated complete normalization of the left ventricular function. She was referred to a psychologist to better manage her anxiety.  Teaching Points: This case illustrates Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which predominantly affects postmenopausal women and is often precipitated by emotional or physical stress. This condition is thought to be related to coronary artery spasms or surge in catecholamines (stress hormones) that """"stun"""" the heart. The syndrome gets its name from """"Takotsubo""""  a Japanese term for octopus trap  because the heart takes on a shape resembling the trap  with a narrow neck and round bottom. The prognosis is generally good with supportive treatment  but further research is needed to establish definitive guidelines."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,6,Patient Case Presentation  Patient Information: The patient is a 72 year-old Caucasian female named Mrs. Jones.  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Jones was brought to the emergency department following complaints of severe chest pain and shortness of breath within 24 hours.   Past Medical History: She has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes which are well controlled with medication. She also has a history of anxiety and depression  and her husband recently passed away.  Family History: Her father passed away at an early age from a heart attack  and her mother has a history of stroke. Her siblings are alive with no known heart diseases.  Social History: Mrs. Jones is a retired teacher  who lives alone and is not alcohol or tobacco dependent. She has been under considerable stress due to her husband's recent passing.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  she appeared acutely distressed. Her blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  heart rate was 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate was 25 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation was 92% on room air  and body temperature was normal. Her cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia but no murmurs. Her lungs were clear to auscultation.   Investigations: Her initial electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  suggestive of an acute myocardial injury. Her troponin levels were mildly elevated. In light of her symptoms  an emergent coronary angiography was performed to rule out a heart attack. The angiogram showed no significant coronary artery disease  which usually indicates a heart attack. However  her subsequent echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning and systolic dysfunction in the left ventricle  which are suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often known as broken heart syndrome.  Diagnosis: Based on her clinical presentation  investigations  and recent stressful life event  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management: Mrs. Jones was started on an ACE inhibitor  beta-blocker and a statin also in view of her hypertension and diabetes. She also received counselling to handle her stress and anxiety.   Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is usually precipitated by intense emotional or physical stress which causes left ventricular dysfunction. Though the mechanism isn't understood completely  it is thought to be due to catecholamine-mediated myocardial stunning. It commonly affects post-menopausal women and people with a history of neurological disorders or psychiatric illnesses. Prognosis is usually good  with most people experiencing complete recovery with appropriate management.   This case illustrates Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which may mimic the presentation of an acute myocardial infarction. It underscores the importance of considering this diagnosis in patients  especially older women with acute cardiac symptoms following significant stress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,7,"Patient's Presentation  Ms. Sasaki is a 63-year-old Japanese female with a past medical history of hypertension and anxiety. She has no known allergies and isn't currently engaged in any substance use. Her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease and stroke in her mother and father  respectively. She was brought to the emergency department following an emotional stressor--the death of her husband.   History of Present Illness  Ms. Sasaki was found in her home experiencing severe chest pain that radiated to her left arm. On questioning  she reported that the pain began suddenly after receiving the news of her husband's demise. She also complained of shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and palpitations.  Examination  On physical examination  she seemed anxious  and her blood pressure was elevated at 158/98 mmHg. The electrocardiogram (ECG) displayed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads  and troponin levels were significantly increased  suggestive of myocardial injury.  Hospital Course  Ms. Sasaki was initially diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS)  but coronary angiography found no obstructive coronary disease. Left ventriculography showed mid and apical segments of the left ventricle appearing akinetic with basal hyperkinesis  giving a shape reminiscent of a takotsubo (Japanese octopus pot).   Diagnosis  Based on her symptoms  lab findings  absence of a significant coronary artery disease  and characteristic findings on the left ventriculography  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as stress or """"broken heart"""" syndrome.  Treatment  Ms. Sasaki was treated with supportive care that included aspirin  a beta-blocker  and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. She was also counseled and started on an anti-anxiety medication for her anxiety disorder  considering the role of emotional stress in TCM.   Outcome  On follow-up after three months  echocardiography showed resolution of the ventricular wall motion abnormalities  and Ms. Sasaki reported feeling better with significant resolution of her symptoms.  Conclusion  In conclusion  this case highlights takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition that commonly affects postmenopausal women and is often triggered by acute emotional or physical stress. An understanding of the different presentation of TCM compared to ACS is crucial in avoiding unnecessary interventions and ensuring the provision of appropriate treatment."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,8,Patient Details: Ms. A  a 63-year-old Caucasian female  was recently diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Medical History: The patient has a known medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and depression  all diagnosed 5 years ago and regularly managed by medications. She has been adherent to her medications  which include an ACE inhibitor for hypertension  statin for hyperlipidemia  and SSRI for her depressive condition. The patient also had a past surgical history of a hysterectomy due to uterine fibroids 10 years ago. She has no known allergies.  Presenting Complaints: Ms. A was brought to the ER with sudden onset chest pain radiating to the neck and right arm. She described the pain as similar to 'an elephant sitting on the chest'  which started abruptly while she was at home grieving over the sudden death of her husband that happened a week ago. She also mentioned associated symptoms like dyspnea  palpitations  and excessive sweating but denied any syncope or pre-syncope.  Family History: She has a family history of cardiovascular diseases. Her father died of myocardial infarction at 72 and her elder brother was diagnosed with heart failure at the age of 75.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient was anxious  and in acute distress  her vitals revealed a blood pressure of 165/90 mmHg  pulse 110 bpm  and respiratory rate 22 per minute. Her body mass index (BMI) was 29  thus indicating overweight.  Investigations & Diagnosis: The ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads which raised a suspicion of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). But the consequent coronary angiogram was normal without any significant blockages ruling out ACS. The echocardiogram reported left ventricular dysfunction with hypokinesis of the apical parts in contrast to the basal parts  along with the absence of other physical causes for such discrepancies. All these findings led to a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The blood tests revealed slightly elevated cardiac biomarkers.  Given her presentation  recent stressor  ECG  echocardiogram results  and the absence of coronary artery disease  Ms. A was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  often referred to as broken-heart syndrome.   Clinical Course & Management: In the hospital  the patient was managed with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors and was closely monitored for any potential complications. She was also referred to a grief counselor  given the recent personal loss considered contributing to her condition.  This case illustrates the typical presentation of TCM  which can mimic ACS  often diagnosed in postmenopausal women with a recent history of severe emotional stress. Prompt recognition and supportive care play a crucial role in managing patients with TCM. Also  coordinating care with mental health professionals may prove beneficial. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,9,"Patient Presentation  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian female  Helen  who presented to the Emergency Department with chief complaints of dyspnea and chest pain. Her symptoms started two hours prior to arrival. She described the pain as a constant  intense pressure sensation  centered in the chest. Helen was visibly distressed and reported feeling weak  with a rated pain scale of 8 out of 10.  Medical History  Helen has a previous history of hypertension  well-controlled with Lisinopril 20mg daily. She also suffers from osteoarthritis  for which she takes over-the-counter NSAIDs. She denies any history of ischemic heart disease  diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia. She has had no prior surgeries and maintains an active lifestyle  walking approximately two miles a day. She quit smoking 20 years ago and drinks alcohol socially.  Recently Helen endured the loss of her husband three weeks ago – a stressful experience that might have played a role in her current hospital visit. She reports having feelings of extreme grief and despair but thought it to be normal after suffering such a significant loss.  Family History  Helen's mother had a history of coronary artery disease and her father was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. There's no family history of sudden cardiac deaths  arrhythmias  or genetic disorders.  Clinical Assessment and Diagnosis  Examination revealed slight pallor and tachypnea  pulse was 112 beats per minute  blood pressure 160/98 mmHg  ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. She was initially treated for acute myocardial infarction (AMI)  however  coronary angiogram showed no significant blockages.  Initially  her cardiac biomarkers were found elevated (Troponin I: 1.6 ng/ml) but later began to decrease. Echocardiography showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction of 39%  thus  suggesting Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an acute myocardial syndrome  primarily affecting postmenopausal women  and is often triggered by acute physical or emotional stressors. In this case  the loss of Helen's husband may have acted as an emotional stressor.  Management Plan  Helen was admitted to the Cardiology unit for close monitoring. She was started on beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and conservative management with a diuretic to help manage her symptoms. Mental health services were also engaged to help her cope with her recent significant loss  as it is thought to be a strong contributing factor to her current diagnosis.  Long-term management of her condition would include follow-up visits with her cardiologist to monitor her heart function and continuity of care with a mental health professional. Further treatment adjustments may be needed based on her recovery progression.   Patient Education and Prognosis  Educating Helen about the importance of stress management and providing the necessary mental health resources is a crucial component of her recovery. It's also essential to explain her condition  anticipated recovery process  and future management plans.  Although Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is typically reversible  long-term prognosis can vary  and recurrence is possible  especially in individuals under continuous stress. Monitoring  regular follow-ups  and a multidisciplinary approach combining both physical and emotional care are important for successful long-term management of this condition."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,10,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  Mrs. Harper Davis  who was presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm and difficulty in breathing.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Davis has a known history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both of which are currently being well-managed with medication. She was also diagnosed with depression and mild anxiety around ten years ago  and has been on consistent psychiatric treatment since then.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient's symptoms started suddenly while she was under a considerable amount of emotional stress following the death of her husband. The symptoms include chest discomfort  shortness of breath  and fatigue. No reported history of palpitations  dizziness  or loss of consciousness.  Family History:   The patient's father died of myocardial infarction at a young age (52 years) and her mother had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). No family history of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was reported.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination reveals an anxious patient in respiratory distress with a mild diaphoresis. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 145/95 mmHg and she has a tachycardia of 110 bpm. Examination of the cardiovascular system reveals mild dual heart sounds with no murmurs. Respiratory system examination is normal with clear lung fields.   Investigations:  Full blood count  renal function  and liver function tests were largely unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevations in leads II  III  aVF  and V4-V6. Troponin level was significantly elevated  confirming myocardial injury. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was then promptly conducted  which showed left ventricular apical ballooning without significant coronary artery disease  consistent with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress and can mimic symptoms of a heart attack. It predominantly affects post-menopausal women and is characterized by a transient left ventricular dysfunction despite the patients’ coronary arteries remaining largely patent. This condition is typically reversible  however  the patient would need to be managed appropriately  and her significant stress hurdles would need to be effectively addressed. In Mrs. Davis’ case  her family history of myocardial infarction may have made her more susceptible to cardiac conditions. Her previous history of psychiatric disorder also fits the typical medical history of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients.   Given her presentation and findings  this case is a classical representation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  occurring in a post-menopausal woman during a period of acute emotional stress. She must be carefully managed not only with the cardiomyopathy but also her emotional distress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,11,"Patient Presentation  The patient is a 70-year-old African American female known as Ms. Johnson. She presented at the E.R. complaining of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm for the past six hours. The patient described the pain as persistent  crushing pain that started while she was at a relative's funeral. She has a medical history significant for hypertension and depression for which she has been on treatment for years. She is non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She has no past surgeries. She is currently medicated with Lisinopril 20mg once daily and sertraline 50 mg once daily.   She lives alone after her husband died three years ago. On the family history front  her father had a myocardial infarction and died at the age of 68  and her mother died at the age of 88 from a stroke.  Clinical Examination and Investigation   On clinical exam  her blood pressure was found to be 168/92 and heart rate 110. EKG revealed ST-elevation in the anterior leads. Lab results showed a troponin I level of 2.2 ng/mL. Given the symptoms  clinical presentation  and investigations  an acute coronary syndrome was suspected  so she was rushed to the cath lab for a coronary angiography.  Upon coronary angiography  no significant coronary artery disease was observed. Left ventriculography  however  displayed apical akinesia with preserved basal function  which is classically known as """"apical ballooning.""""   Diagnosis  Based on the patient's clinical presentation  the lack of significant coronary disease on angiography  and the distinctive image of apical ballooning  she was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or “broken heart syndrome”.  Management  Ms. Johnson was managed with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and closely monitored in the cardiac care unit. With the course of several days  the patient's chest pain resolved. An echocardiogram performed one week later showed marked improvement in left ventricular function. She was then referred for cardiac rehabilitation. Mental health resources and grief counseling were also recommended owing to her recent loss.  Discussion  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is commonly triggered by intense emotional or physical stress  as was the case for this patient dealing with the death of a loved one. Though TCM is more common in postmenopausal women and those with a history of neurologic or psychiatric disorders  which correspond to our patient's profile  it can occur in patients of any demographic. In conclusion  it is crucial for clinicians to consider TCM as a differential diagnosis in patients  especially older women  presenting with chest pain  especially in the setting of recent significant emotional stress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,12,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. Gina Fernandez is a 69-year-old Hispanic female presenting to the Emergency Department for chest pain that started after she heard of her son's sudden death in an accident. She has a past medical history of hypothyroidism and osteoarthritis but no prior cardiac history. Her only cardiovascular risk factor includes her age  with no history of smoking  diabetes  or high cholesterol. She lives independently at home with her younger daughter.  Family history reveals her mother had a myocardial infarction at the age of 72. Her father  deceased at 78  had Alzheimer's. Ms. Fernandez is widowed and recently retired after a long career as a high school teacher.  On physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and complained about dyspnea. Her blood pressure was 145/90 mm Hg  heart rate was 102 beats per minute  respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia but no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. EKG showed ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads (V2-V6). Initial lab results revealed modest troponin elevation.  The patient was immediately taken for cardiac catheterization considering myocardial infarction  which revealed normal coronary arteries but apical ballooning of the left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction (EF 40%). Left ventriculogram findings  along with the patient's symptoms and EKG changes  were consistent with a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome.""""  The sudden emotional stress of her son's tragic passing appeared to have triggered Ms. Fernandez's TCM. The patient was treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and supportive care  including anxiety management. During the follow-up visit two weeks later  the patient reported a reduction in symptoms  and repeat echocardiogram showed improved cardiac function with EF of 55%.  Teaching Point:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy often manifests following severe emotional or physical stress  resulting in transient left ventricular dysfunction. Although it frequently presents similarly to myocardial infarction  it is characterized by minimal myocardial necrosis and often normal coronary arteries. Management generally involves treating the symptom acutely and addressing the stressor. Most cases improve substantially with supportive treatment.  This case is a reminder of the significant influence stress can have on physiological functioning  particularly in older adults who may have less physiological reserve to manage such events. Furthermore  while TCM is more common in postmenopausal women  it can occur in anyone  regardless of age  gender  or race."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,13,Patient Introduction: A 68-year-old African American woman presents to the emergency department (ED) with acute chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations. The patient lives alone and has been somewhat socially isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both under satisfactory control with antihypertensives (enalapril) and oral hypoglycemics (metformin) respectively. She has a BMI of 29  which categorizes her as overweight. She has been smoking 10 cigarettes a day for the past 35 years. There is no known allergy to medications.  Family History: Her father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 62  and her mother has a history of stroke and type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is no known familial record of cardiomyopathy or other heart diseases.  Patient Encounter: A week before presenting to the ED  she experienced the unexpected death of her only son. Given her symptoms and the severe stressor  the ED considered Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) or an acute coronary syndrome (ACS)  with differential diagnoses including acute heart failure  arrhythmias  or aortic dissection.   Investigation and Diagnosis: Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. Troponin I levels were elevated. Echocardiogram showed apical ballooning with a strongly contracting base  a classic appearance of TC  and left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated at 35%. Coronary angiogram was performed to distinguish between TC and ACS  which revealed no significant coronary artery disease. The diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was confirmed based on the Mayo Clinic criteria  encompassing transient hypokinesis  akinesis  or dyskinesis in the left ventricular mid segments leading to apical ballooning; absence of obstructive coronary disease or angiographic evidence of acute plaque rupture; and new ECG abnormalities or modest elevation in cardiac troponin level.  Treatment and Prognosis: The patient was managed conservatively with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics to manage heart failure symptoms. Her symptoms gradually improved over the next few days and she was discharged on the 7th hospital day with outpatient cardiology follow-up.  Discussion：  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome) is estimated to represent about 1–2% of all acute coronary syndromes. Although it occurs more frequently in postmenopausal women  it has been reported in all ages  races  and genders. The pathogenesis of TC is not clearly understood but is associated with severe emotional or physiological stress that produces a surge of catecholamines  leading to acute heart failure  lethal arrhythmias  or cardiogenic shock. The case underscores TC's association with acute emotional stress and the importance of including it in differential diagnoses when presented with typical cardio symptoms following a major life stressor.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,14,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old widowed Caucasian female who presented with severe chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  nausea  and profuse sweating. The onset of symptoms started abruptly two days ago following bad news about the sudden death of her only son. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension for 25 years  for which she has been regularly taking medication (amlodipine 5mg once daily). She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. She has no known allergies.   Demographics:  The patient's details are consistent with the demographic characteristics often associated with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as broken heart syndrome  which is more frequently found in post-menopausal women in the age group of 58-75 years  especially Caucasians or those of European descent. The condition is often precipitated by a significant emotional or physical stressor. In this case  the death of her son.  Family History:  The patient's family history revealed that her parents had a history of cardiovascular disease. Her mother was diagnosed with coronary artery disease at the age of 72 years and her father succumbed to myocardial infarction at 78.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and in acute distress. The blood pressure was slightly elevated (145/90)  pulse irregular (110bpm)  respiratory rate increased (22 breaths per minute)  and saturation was 94% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reported tachycardia  no murmurs  rubs  or gallop.   Diagnostic Assessment:  An urgent ECG revealed ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion  suggestive of myocardial ischemia. Detailed cardiac biomarker tests revealed slightly elevated troponin I levels. The patient underwent echocardiography  which showed significant apical ballooning and reduced systolic function suggestive of TCM.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Medical management started immediately with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors to reduce the myocardial oxygen demand and manage the hypertension. The patient's condition was closely monitored for potential complications of TCM like ventricular rupture  thrombus formation  or heart failure.  Discussion:  The patient's demographic  clinical signs  underlying physical condition  and triggering emotional stress event are typical of TCM patients. Although her troponin I levels were slightly elevated  which is a typical finding with TCM  ST-segment changes might be mistaken for acute coronary syndrome  which ruled out after coronary angiography confirmed TCM.  TCM is generally reversible with suitable treatment and emotional support. The patient's prognosis is usually favorable  but care must be taken to monitor and manage potential complications. Since the patient has hypertension  continued management of this condition is necessary to prevent further episodes of TCM.   References:  - Templin  C. et al. (2015).

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,15,Patient Profile: Name: Jane Doe Age: 68 Years Old Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Teacher  Introduction: Jane Doe is our patient  a 68 years old Caucasian female  retired teacher  recently diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC). Prior to this diagnosis  Jane enjoyed a generally healthy lifestyle; she does not smoke  drinks alcohol minimally  and moderate exercises a few times a week.  Presenting Symptom: Jane initially sought help when she began experiencing severe chest pain and shortness of breath  symptoms typically associated with myocardial infarction. ECG showed significant ST elevation in the anterior leads  and cardiac troponin levels were found to be elevated.  Medical History: Jane has been treated previously for essential hypertension which has been controlled with medication over the past 5 years. This condition  along with her age and gender  put her at a slightly higher risk for TTC. Other than hypertension  Jane has no significant medical history  a nonsmoker with no known allergies.   Family History: Her mother died of heart failure at age 75  and her father died of cancer at age 77. Genetic influence on TTC remains largely speculative  but given her mother's history of heart disease  her TTC might have some genetic factors.  Diagnosis and Investigations: Her initial diagnostic tests suggested an Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)  however  subsequent coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease. An echocardiogram was performed which displayed hypokinesia of the left ventricle with apical ballooning  typical of TTC. Cardiac MRI also confirmed the absence of significant atherosclerosis or evidence of myocardial infarction.  Treatment: Jane was initiated on oral beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. She was also advised to limit stress  as extreme emotional stress is often linked to the onset of TTC  suggesting that a stress management plan should be incorporated into her health management strategies.  Social History: She is a widow living alone since her husband passed away 3 years ago. Her two adult children visit regularly. As a retired teacher  Jane is well-educated and possesses good health literacy  which will aid in her understanding and management of her condition.   Conclusion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is increasingly recognized as an important differential diagnosis in women presenting with chest pain and ECG changes suggestive of an anterior myocardial infarction. Jane’s case is typical as the majority of people diagnosed with TTC are postmenopausal women. Jane's case highlights the necessity of considering TTC as a potential diagnosis in similar patients  and illustrates the important role of non-invasive imaging in diagnosing and managing this condition. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,16,"Patient Profile: Ms. A  a 67-year-old Caucasian female from Denver  CO comes to the hospital complaining of chest pain  similar to that of a heart attack. She's a retired school teacher  divorced  living with her adult daughter and her family. She's a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. However  she's been dealing with noticeable emotional stress for the last few months due to the recent death of her eldest son.   Past Medical History: Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  well-controlled under medication for the past ten years. She has no past history of heart disease or any other serious chronic illnesses. Regular follow-ups were maintained.   Presenting Complaints: Ms. A was experiencing severe chest pain  accompanied by shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Her symptoms had suddenly worsened over the past few hours.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Upon electrocardiogram (EKG)  ST-segment elevation was noticed but blood tests showed no hardened blockages typically seen in heart attacks. An echocardiogram showed a significant reduction in left ventricular function with apical ballooning  a typical feature suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"Broken Heart Syndrome"""". Coronary Angiography done afterward confirmed the absence of any significant coronary artery disease  solidifying the diagnosis further.   Family History: She has a paternal family history of coronary artery disease. Her father passed away at the age of 73 due to a myocardial infarction. Her mother  now deceased  had diabetes. Ms. A's only sibling  a 69-year-old brother  has a history of hypertension.  Social History: Ms. A is divorced with 3 children. Her eldest son died recently in a car accident  which has had a profound emotional impact on Ms. A. She's a non-smoker and drinks alcohol only occasionally. She leads an active lifestyle  regularly going for walks with her dog.  Treatment and Response: Ms. A was administered beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors to reduce the load on her heart and to improve her ventricular function. Emotional support and counseling were recommended considering her recent emotional trauma.   Uniqueness of the Case: The case brings into light the unique correlation between emotional stress and heart health. Ms. A's recent emotional distress appears to have translated into physical disease  demonstrating the rare  but real  occurrence of 'Broken Heart Syndrome'.  Follow-up: Regular follow-ups were scheduled to monitor her cardiac function  check her blood pressure  and evaluate her response to medications. Ms. A was advised to continue her current medications for her hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Prognosis: While takotsubo cardiomyopathy can potentially be life-threatening  most people recover completely with appropriate medical treatment and stress management. The overall prognosis for Ms. A appears to be good considering her previously controlled comorbid conditions and her active lifestyle."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,17,Patient Presentation:  Patient Identity: Mrs. Rebecca Jones  a 58-year-old African American female.  Demographic Information: She is a widower residing in Detroit  with two adult children. She is a retired school teacher and is occasionally engaged in volunteering activities at a local community center.  Reason for visit: The patient presented at the emergency department with acute chest pain and shortness of breath  mimicking heart attack symptoms.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Jones has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. She keeps up with her appointments and takes prescribed medications consistently. She has no history of heart disease but has experienced periodic bouts of depression since her husband's death two years ago.  Family History: Her mother suffered from hypertension and myocardial infarction  leading to her death at 70. Her father was diabetic and died at the age of 76 due to complications of diabetes. Her older brother  aged 63  is currently living with a diagnosis of heart failure.  Symptoms: Mrs. Jones was experiencing severe chest pain  shortness of breath  sweatiness  and a sense of impending doom. The event occurred after she received news of her best friend's sudden death. Separate from these symptoms  she reported episodes of lightheadedness in the past two weeks. She denies any history of substance abuse  addiction  or harmful behavioral tendencies.  Clinical Examination: On physical exam  she was found to be tachycardic and hypertensive. An ECG showed ST-segment elevation  which initially suggested a myocardial infarction. However  a coronary angiogram showed no significant coronary artery disease which could explain her symptoms.  Diagnosis: Taken together  her symptoms  the immediate temporal link with an emotionally stressful event  and findings of apical ballooning on cardiac echocardiogram led to a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome.  Plan:  Considering her diagnosis  Mrs. Jones was initiated on ACE inhibitors to manage her blood pressure and beta-blockers to address her tachycardia. She was also referred to a psychologist to help manage her emotional stressors. Patient education is planned to outline the need for stress management in preventing future events.  This case outlines a classic presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is commonly triggered by significant psychosocial stress and often mimics an acute coronary syndrome event. The condition is more common in postmenopausal women and may have a higher incidence in patients with a history of neurologic or psychiatric illness.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,18,Subject: Male Patient Age 62  suffering from Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Demographics: Our patient  Mr. J  is a Caucasian male  aged 62  a retired high-school teacher who resides in suburban USA. He lives alone  is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. J. was admitted to the emergency department (ED) reporting acute chest pain and breathlessness following a heated confrontation during a local community meeting. He described the pain as severe  crushing  and radiating to his left arm.  Past Medical History: Mr. J’s past medical history includes mild hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been managing these conditions through diet modification  exercise regime and medication (Lisinopril 10mg once a day for Hypertension; Simvastatin 20mg at nights for Hyperlipidemia).  Family History: His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 65 and his mother had a history of stroke. He has one older sibling who is healthy.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  his blood pressure was elevated (160/95mmHg) and his heart rate was slightly increased (110 beats per minute). There were no significant findings on lung or abdominal examination. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads and his troponin levels were slightly elevated.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Due to ECG changes and troponin elevation  acute coronary syndrome was suspected  and he was sent for an emergent coronary angiography  which surprisingly was normal. Echocardiogram revealed a reduced ejection fraction with apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesis  findings consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as “broken heart syndrome”. These investigations led to the diagnosis of TCM  which was confirmed by running a Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Stress and anxiety due to the confrontation likely acted as a trigger for the TCM.  Treatment and Prognosis: Mr. J was treated with aspirin  beta-blockers  and ACE inhibitors  coupled with close observation in the cardiac care unit. As is typical with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  complete recovery of left ventricular function was expected within weeks following appropriate medical management and stress reduction.  The plan includes close outpatient follow-up with his primary care provider and a referral for psychological interventions aimed at stress management. In addition  reiteration of the importance of adherence to his hypertension and hyperlipidemia medications  a low-sodium diet  and routine exercise was undertaken.  This case is typical for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which predominantly affects postmenopausal women but can also occur in men  particularly during periods of extreme emotional stress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,19,Patient Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Background: The patient  a 68-year-old Asian female  presented complaints of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. This was her first instance of such a complaint. She is a law-abiding citizen  retired  living alone in suburban area with adequate social support. She is a widow and has two adult children with no history of cardiac diseases.   Her past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypothyroidism  which were well controlled with antihypertensives and thyroid hormone replacement therapy. She denied alcohol  tobacco  or illicit drug use. She has a family history of hypertension but no diagnosed cardiac diseases.  Clinical Presentation: The patient presented with symptoms typical of acute myocardial infarction  including acute  severe chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw  alongside shortness of breath. On exam  BP was 150/90 mmHg  pulse 105 bpm  and she appeared in mild distress.  Investigations: An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an ST-segment elevation suggestive of anterolateral myocardial ischemia without Q waves. Cardiac bio-markers were elevated - Troponin-T was 2.5 ng/mL (normal limits = 0-0.1 ng/mL).  On hospital Day 2  a coronary angiogram revealed no significant coronary artery disease. The diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was pointed out on further evaluation by echocardiogram that demonstrated hypokinesis of the mid and apical segments with hyperkinesis of the basal segments typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (‘octopus pot’ sign).  Management: She was treated conservatively with ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  diuretics to relieve congestive symptoms  and reassurance. On Day 5  the patient's symptomatology had much improved. She was discharged with caution to avoid severe emotional stress and with the direction to continue her regimen of medications and regular follow-ups.  Prognosis and Follow-up: Given the lack of recurrent chest pain and the beneficial effect of early conservative management  her prognosis is generally good.  She was monitored closely with a 2-week follow-up to ensure regression of cardiographic changes and again after 3 months. She was advised on the potential complications such as arrhythmia  heart failure and rupture and told to take immediate help if symptoms recur.   Summary: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy often presents similarly to an acute coronary syndrome  but it is an entirely different condition usually induced by extreme stress  more common in post-menopausal women. Despite its dramatic onset  this syndrome generally has a good prognosis  provided it is identified and managed in a timely manner.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,20,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: Ms. A is a 65-year-old African American female who presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. She is a long-standing resident of Washington  DC  living alone after being widowed 5 years ago. She has two living children who also reside in other states. She's a retired teacher and has an active lifestyle consisting of frequent walks and yoga sessions.  Past Medical History: Ms. A was previously healthy with no chronic conditions such as hypertension  diabetes or asthma. She had a full menopause at 50 years with no postmenopausal complication or hormone replacement therapy. Ms. A is a lifelong non-smoker and she consumes alcohol occasionally.   Family History: Her mother died at an older age due to Alzheimer’s disease  and her father died from a stroke at the age of 70. One of her siblings was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 55. There is no documented history of cardiac disease in the immediate family.  Presenting Complaints: Ms. A experienced sudden and intense chest pain radiating to the back and described it to be like 'a heavy vest'. Accompanying shortness of breath exacerbated the panic she was in.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  Ms. A appeared distressed but her vital signs on admission were stable: blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg  heart rate 95 beats per min  temperature 37.0°C  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Heart and lung examinations were unremarkable. There was no palpable peripheral oedema.  Investigations: Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in anterior leads suggesting an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. Her initial troponin level was significantly elevated. However  coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries  not typical of myocardial infarction.  Diagnosis and Progress: Given her presenting symptoms  ECG changes  elevated cardiac enzymes  and the lack of coronary artery disease on angiogram  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) or 'broken-heart syndrome'. She was also having an anniversary of her husband's death  pointing towards the psychological stress event that precipitated the TCM.  Management and Follow-up: Ms. A was started on a conservative heart failure regimen  including beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. She responded well to the medication  and her symptoms started to improve within a week. Three months follow-up echocardiography showed completely normal left ventricular function.  This case highlights the importance of considering Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy when treating postmenopausal women with sudden-onset chest pain and stress. It also emphasizes the need for a high degree of suspicion and a comprehensive diagnostic approach  considering that this condition can easily be mistaken for acute coronary syndrome.  
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,21,"Patient Presentation: Ms. Santiago  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She reported the sudden onset of these symptoms while attending her husband's funeral earlier in the day  with radiating left arm pain and feelings of faintness.  Past Medical History: In evaluation of her past medical history  we note that Ms. Santiago had been previously diagnosed with hypertension. However  she has been showing compliance to prescribed antihypertensives. She has no history of diabetes  stroke  or ischemic heart disease. She has a documented allergic reaction to penicillin where she broke out in a rash.  Family History: Her family history reveals that her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 72 and her father had a stroke at 76. She has a younger sister who has type 2 diabetes. There is no reported incidence of cardiomyopathies in her close family circle.  Social History: Ms. Santiago is retired. She quit smoking 20 years ago and drinks alcohol occasionally. She lives alone  as her only child is out of state.  Physical Examination & Investigation Findings: Upon examination  Ms. Santiago was in distress. Risk factors comprised her age  female gender  post-menopause state  and the intense psychological stress due to her husband’s sudden demise. Physical exam showed a blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  and she was afebrile. ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Lab results showed marginally elevated troponin levels and normal cholesterol levels. Echocardiogram showed left ventricular apical ballooning with a low ejection fraction of 45%. Coronary angiography did not reveal any significant blockages that would validate ischemic heart disease.  Diagnosis: Combining the information given by the patient's history  physical examination and investigations  Ms. Santiago was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Management and Patient Education: Ms. Santiago was admitted to the cardiology unit. Management included an ACE inhibitor  beta-blocker  and aspirin. Psychotherapy was also advised to manage stress.   She was educated about her condition  the significance of medication adherence  and scheduled for follow-ups. She was further educated about early recognition of heart failure symptoms and advised to revise her lifestyle  incorporating a balanced diet  regular exercise  and stress management.  Ms. Santiago was referred to a local support group for individuals having lost loved ones  and arrangements were made for her son to be more involved in her care. She was scheduled for follow-up in a cardiomyopathy clinic in 3-6 months to assess the regression of her cardiac changes."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,22,Patient Profile: Ms. MG  is a 69-year-old African American woman who resides in Miami  Florida. She works as a retired school teacher and lives alone  with regular contact to her close family who live in the same area.  Presenting Complaint and Past Medical History: Ms. MG presented to the Emergency Department (ER) with acute chest pain and fainting spells that began earlier that morning. She has a history of hypertension  and is currently managing it with Amlodipine. Apart from that  she has remained in good health and reports no previous history of cardiac problems. Relative to lifestyle factors  she is a non-smoker and drinks a moderate amount of alcohol.  Family History:  Her family history is significant with her father  who had an ischemic heart disease and died in his late 50s  and her mother who passed of cancer in her 70s. She has two brothers  one of whom has type 2 diabetes while the other enjoys good health.  Hospital Course and Diagnosis: Upon admission to the ER  her blood pressure was slightly elevated  and blood tests showed a mild increase in cardiac biomarkers. The initial diagnosis was acute coronary syndrome (ACS)  but subsequent coronary angiography did not reveal any significant obstructions in her coronary arteries. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was carried out  which showed ST-segment elevation  and an echocardiogram indicated reduced left ventricular function with apical ballooning  suggesting the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Background: This condition  also known as broken-heart syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy  is characteristically seen in postmenopausal women and often triggered by intense emotional or physiological stress. Interestingly  Ms. MG had recently lost her best friend  which had caused her significant distress.  Treatment:  She was treated with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and emotional counseling.   Outcome: Ms. MG's chest pain resolved following treatment  and she was discharged from the hospital after two weeks. During re-evaluation after six weeks  her left ventricular function had returned to normal. She was advised to continue with medication and regular follow-ups with her cardiologist. Psychological counseling was also suggested due to the stress-related nature of TCM to support her mental health.  This case shows how emotional stress can lead to significant physiological impact  underscoring the importance of managing both physical and emotional health in patients. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,23,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American female presenting with acute onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and feelings of intense anxiety. These symptoms began suddenly following the death of her husband  approximately two weeks prior to her presentation. The patient doesn’t have any past medical history of any chronic illnesses  such as hypertension  diabetes mellitus  or any cardiovascular disease. However  she admits to living a highly stressful lifestyle due to her recent widowhood. She denies tobacco  alcohol  or any substance abuse.  Physically  she appears anxious and distressed. Vital signs on presentation include: heart rate of 105 beats/minute  blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  respiratory rate of 21 breaths/minute  temperature of 98.6°F  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.  Complete Demographics:  Her social history includes being a widow with no children and she is a retired teacher. She lives alone with her dog in Boca Raton  Florida  USA. The patient mentions she has a limited social network  with her primary companion being her late husband. She reports her ethnicity as African American and her primary language as English.  Family History:  The patient’s father died at 70 from what she reports as 'heart trouble.' Her mother is still living  at 85  diagnosed with type-2 diabetes. In terms of siblings  she has an older sister who  aged 68  has been diagnosed with breast cancer and hypertension  and a younger brother  aged 60  with no significant medical issues.  Clinical Condition:  On further examination  an ECG shows ST elevation in anterior leads  and Troponin levels are mildly elevated. Based on the patient's symptoms  ECG and biomarker findings  the initial suspicion is the diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction. However  an emergency angiogram reveals no significant coronary artery disease that could have been responsible for her presenting symptoms.  Subsequently  an echocardiogram demonstrates apical ballooning of the left ventricle  consistent with ‘Takotsubo cardiomyopathy’ or ‘broken heart syndrome ' a condition commonly precipitated by severe emotional stress. This diagnosis is problematically uncommon in African-American women  as it has been predominantly noticed in postmenopausal white women. However  no demographic background is immune  and this case illustrates that emotional stress can potentially induce drastic cardiovascular events in any individual  irrespective of their ethnicity or social background.  Patient Management:  She was managed conservatively with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and a brief course of diuretics for her mild pulmonary congestion. Additionally  she was referred for bereavement counselling and stress management therapy to cope with her loss and minimize further episodes. On four-week follow-up  her recovery was uneventful with a noticeable improvement in her symptoms and echocardiographic appearance.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the significance of incorporating emotional stress in the differential diagnoses of acute coronary syndrome  especially in patients with recent stressful events. It emphasizes the need for a comprehensive management plan that includes addressing psychosocial stressors to prevent recurrence of such episodes.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,24,Patient Presentation: The patient is Ms. K  a 72-year-old Asian female  presenting with sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. Ms. K. is a retired school teacher living alone  widowed  with no children. She has a history of hypertension  well-controlled with lisinopril  but no other significant past medical history. She neither smokes  drinks  nor uses any illicit substances. Her family history includes a mother with diabetes  a father with coronary artery disease  and a sister with breast cancer.   Admission: Ms. K was initially admitted during the weekend when she experienced an intensely stressful event  her house got burgled. The sudden onset of chest pain while watching her property being stolen  and the following exacerbating dyspnea  quickly prompted her to seek medical attention.  Clinical Presentation: On examination  Ms. K appeared distressed but conscious. Her blood pressure was 170/100 mmHg  heart rate was 110 bpm  temperature of 37.2°C  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Elevated heart rate and blood pressure were indicative of her overall distress and anxiety.  Investigations: Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST elevation  and blood tests revealed slightly elevated cardiac enzymes. However  coronary angiography performed to determine presence of ischemic heart disease revealed no substantial disease or blockages that would explain the ST elevation. Apical ballooning of the left ventricle  as shown on echocardiogram  with hyperkinesia at the base and hypokinesia at the apex  raised suspicion for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The patient's levels of Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) were also noticeably higher than the normal range.  Diagnosis: Considering her pre-existing hypertension  elderly age  post-menopausal status  and the intensely stressful trigger incident  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  or stress-induced cardiomyopathy  was diagnosed.   Treatment: Ms. K was treated with standard heart failure medications (ACE inhibitors  Beta Blockers)  and her hypertension was managed accordingly. A consult with a psychiatrist was arranged for stress management counselling.   Health Follow-up:  Fortunately  with appropriate management  her condition improved drastically. Two months following her initial presentation  her follow-up echocardiography showed improvement in left ventricular function. Ms. K has been symptom-free since then and her latest ECG and cardiac enzyme levels are within normal limits. Strongly suggested lifestyle modifications and ongoing psychic therapy sessions to manage stress are part of her long-term follow-up program.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,25,Patient Presentation:   Name: Maria Fernandes Age: 68 years Sex: Female Origin: Hispanic Occupation: Retired Nurse  Presenting Problem: Ms. Fernandes presented at the hospital with central chest pain radiating to the left arm  nausea  and faintness. She reported that these symptoms began after getting news that her brother had passed away suddenly.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is experiencing well-controlled diabetes with metformin (first-line therapy) and has been on antihypertensive medication (ACE inhibitors) for the last 10 years. There is no history of prior heart disease  stroke  major surgeries  or other significant medical conditions. She quit smoking 10 years ago and drinks alcohol only socially. Her glycemic control has been good  and her last HbA1c was 6.8%.   Family History: There is a family history of cardiovascular disease. Her father died of a myocardial infarction at 72 years  and her mother had a stroke at 75 but survived. None of her siblings have a known history of cardiac syndromes.  Clinical Examination and Diagnosis: An electrocardiogram was performed and showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads but no pathological Q waves. The initial troponin I level was slightly elevated. Urgent coronary angiography showed no obstructive coronary artery disease  but left ventriculogram revealed midventricular and apical akinesia along with hypercontractility of the basal walls. Echocardiographic images demonstrated reduced ejection fraction with regional wall motion abnormalities and apical ballooning. This  along with the patient's presentation and examination findings  led to the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).   Note: Contrary to common perception  TCM is seen not only in post-menopausal women but also affects a significant proportion of the Hispanic/LatinX population albeit with no clear reason. It is often precipitated by emotional or physical stress (like bereavement in this case) and has a clinical presentation resembling acute coronary syndrome. It tends to manifest more commonly in individuals with a type A (stress-prone) personality and those with psychiatric and neurologic disorders.  Treatment Plan: As she was hemodynamically stable  conservative management was implemented that included ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and aspirin. Counseling to deal with her emotional stress was also executed.  Prognosis: Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy has a generally favorable prognosis  but patients require close follow-up as there is a risk of complications such as heart failure  arrhythmias  and stroke. The reversible nature of this cardiomyopathy means that recovery of ventricular function can be expected within weeks to months. However  emotional support and effective stress management are crucial due to the strong correlation with emotional stress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,26,Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old African American female  named M.B. She is a retired school teacher  living in New York. She is divorced with two adult children  and she lives alone.  Presenting Chief Complaint: M.B. presented with an acute onset of chest pain radiating to the left side of her neck and arm. She complained of sudden difficulty breathing  mild nausea and fainting episodes.  Vital Signs and Physical Examination: On examination  her blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg  pulse rate irregular 90 beats/min  temperature 98.6°F  and respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min. M.B. was anxious and diaphoretic  but she was pain-free during the examination.  Past Medical History: M.B. has no prior history of cardiovascular disease. However  she is hypertensive and has been on antihypertensive medications for seven years. M.B. also has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for ten years  which has been managed with diet and oral hypoglycemic medications. She does not smoke but consumes alcohol socially.  Family History: Her mother died of stroke at 78 years and her father died of myocardial infarction at 72 years.  Investigations: An electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4. Her troponin levels were elevated  indicative of heart muscle damage. Coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease ruling out myocardial infarction. Left ventriculogram done revealed typical ballooning of the apex with good basal contraction suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. M.B. was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  based on the combination of clinical presentation and imaging findings.  Management and Follow-up: M.B. was treated with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors and aspirin  which relieved her symptoms of chest pain. She was advised to reduce stress and incorporate relaxation practices into her daily routine. On her follow-up appointment after 2 months  she reported no further chest pain or difficulty breathing. Repeat echocardiography demonstrated resolution of previous LV dysfunction  confirming the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Conclusion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly known as broken heart syndrome  typically affects postmenopausal women and is often triggered by severe mental or physical stress. M.B. is a typical patient with takotsubo cardiomyopathy given her profile as a postmenopausal woman exposed to stress. With appropriate management and stress reduction techniques  she has made a good recovery.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,27,"Patient Presentation:   Ms. L.T. is a 67-year-old  Asian female  living in an urban dwelling  who is currently retired. Her occupation had previously been of a high-stress environment  being a senior lawyer in a demanding firm.  Past Medical History:   Ms. L.T. has a history of well-managed hypertension diagnosed 15 years ago  for which she takes Lisinopril. She is non-diabetic; she doesn't smoke and only uses alcohol minimally. Her last mammogram was normal. Three months back  she had an abnormal thyroid function test but the repeating test returned to normal.  Family History:   She has a family history of cardiovascular diseases. Her father fell victim to a fatal myocardial infarction at the age of 60  and her mother passed away following a stroke at age 79. She has two siblings with hypertension and one with coronary artery disease after the age of 50.  Presenting Complaint:   Ms. L.T. presented to the emergency department with acute onset crushing chest pain radiating to the left arm. It was associated with nausea and weaknees which began after she heard the sudden news of her only daughter's fatal car accident far away from home.   Investigations:  Her ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads and her troponin I level was raised. However  her coronary angiogram did not reveal any significant obstructive coronary artery disease that would explain the ECG findings. Echocardiogram exhibited dyskinesis in the mid-apical segments but preserved systolic function in the basal segments resulting in a balloon-like appearance of the left ventricle during systole; a characteristic finding in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis:  Based on her sudden onset stress-induced symptoms  normal coronary angiogram  characteristic ECG and echocardiogram findings  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""".  Management:  She was managed with aspirin  beta-blockers  and ACE inhibitors. She was also recommended for emotional support and psychological therapies to deal with her grief and prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for her acute emotional distress.  Discussion:  The exact prevalence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is unclear  but it is observed that this condition is more common in postmenopausal women and it may often be underdiagnosed. Increased awareness and understanding of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is essential to ensure patients like Ms. L.T. receive prompt and appropriate treatment.  Follow-up:  Ms. L.T. was scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 1 month and referred for grief counseling. Regular echocardiography is planned to monitor the progression of her ventricle recovery."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,28,Patient Profile:  Mr. Y  a 65 year-old male of Caucasian descent  was admitted to the hospital with primary complaints of chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations which started after a major stressful event. The patient is a retired military serviceman who recently lost his wife. He has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He also exhibits moderate alcohol use and has a 20-year history of smoking. He denies prior heart ailments but had been under treatment for anxiety disorders for 5 years. He lives alone and does not have any immediate family but informs that his father had succumbed to a heart attack at age 70.  Clinical Presentation:  On examination  Mr. Y appeared in acute distress with a blood pressure of 160/95 mm Hg  pulse 110 beats/minute  respiratory rate 24 breaths/minute and SAT 92%. He complained of severe chest pain that was radiating to his left arm. Electrocardiography revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterior and lateral leads.  Hospital Course:  Under the impression of acute coronary syndrome (ACS)  he was transferred to the coronary care unit. Emergency coronary angiography was performed which showed no relevant stenoses. However  the left ventriculogram revealed apical ballooning with reduced ejection fraction (~35%) which indicated Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM). Blood tests further confirmed the diagnosis by revealing elevated levels of Troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide but normal CPK–MB levels.  Management:  He was treated with supportive therapy for heart failure: ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics. Due to his elevated anxiety levels and subsequent stress  psychiatric consultation was taken  and anxiolytics were started. After a week of treatment  there was a significant improvement in his condition with normalization of Ejection Fraction with lessened wall motion abnormalities  as seen in the echocardiogram.  Conclusion:  This case of Mr. Y highlights the fact that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy can also present with typical ACS symptoms and must be considered in differential diagnosis  notably in postmenopausal women and older men experiencing severe stress. It also throws light on the essential incorporation of mental health management in the therapeutic plan of such patients dealing with recurrent severe stress and anxiety.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,29,Patient Presentation  Mr. Smith  a 57-year-old Asian male  presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe chest pain and shortness of breath  which developed suddenly after hearing about the unexpected death of a close family friend. The pain was described as squeezing in character  radiating to his left arm  and was rated as 8/10 in intensity. Other associated symptoms included profuse sweating  palpitations  and mild nausea.  Past Medical History  Mr. Smith is known to have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension  for which he is on oral metformin and calcium channel blockers  respectively. He quit smoking 12 years ago and drinks alcohol occasionally. His last annual check-up was six months ago  and his diabetes and blood pressure were well under control. He had no previous cardiac-related issues.  Family History  His family history revealed that his father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 63 and his mother is living with osteoporosis. His eldest brother  aged 65  is also hypertensive.   Upon admission  his vitals were: BP-150/90 mmHg  HR- 105 bpm  RR-22 breaths/min  and SpO2-94% on room air. Physical examination was generally unremarkable.   Investigation and Diagnosis  His ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in anterior leads  initially raising suspicion for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However  his cardiac enzyme levels were only slightly elevated  which is unusual for a typical STEMI. An immediate transthoracic echocardiogram showed left ventricular (LV) apical akinesis with hyperkinesis of the basal segments  a finding consistent with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM).   Further workup  including a coronary angiogram  ruled out occlusive coronary artery disease. All findings  clinical presentation  and preceding emotional stress confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also commonly known as Broken Heart Syndrome.  Treatment and Follow-ups  He was treated with supportive measures – beta-adrenergic blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and a short course of diuretics to optimise his cardiac function. Due to the transient nature of TCM  Mr. Smith gradually improved over the next few weeks.  In the subsequent follow-ups  his chest pain completely resolved  and an echocardiogram undertaken three months later showed reversal of the previous wall-motion abnormalities  confirming the transient nature of the illness.  This case illustrates the importance of identifying the unique characteristics of TCM as a differential diagnosis in patients  especially postmenopausal women or older men experiencing stress-induced acute chest pain. It emphasizes the need to rule out obstructive coronary arterial disease in such situations  considering the implications for treatment and prognosis. Importantly  the transient nature of TCM requires careful patient education about prognosis and follow-up. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,30,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old African American female named Mrs. Johnson  residing in the urban heart of Detroit  Michigan. She is a widow with no children and lives alone in her apartment  with occasional visits from her younger sister and niece. Mrs. Johnson  an elementary school teacher before statutory retirement  has a vivacious social life involving the local church and volunteer organizations. She experienced significant stress due to the loss of her close friend to COVID-19 recently.  Medical History:  Mrs. Johnson's past medical history includes hypertension  managed with amlodipine  and osteoarthritis. She also has a history of major depressive disorder  which has been controlled with medication and psychotherapy over the past decade. Additionally  she suffers from chronic low back pain  for which she takes ibuprofen occasionally. She does not smoke or consume alcohol regularly. There is no history of substance abuse.  Recent Presentation and Symptoms:  Mrs. Johnson presented with acute onset chest pain and difficulty in breathing after learning about her friend's death. EKG abnormalities were noted  showing ST elevations in the anterior leads. Her initial troponin levels were also elevated.   Diagnostic Findings:   Upon evaluation at the hospital  an echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the heart with preserved basal function  suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome). The coronary angiogram did not show any significant obstructions. Together these findings confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Treatment and Outcome:  Mrs. Johnson was managed professionally with supportive care  including beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to manage her heart health situation. Mental health services were also consulted due to the significant stressful event that may have triggered her symptoms. She was discharged home in stable condition on her previously mentioned hypertensive medications  newly prescribed beta-blockers  and intensive counseling to help her cope with her friend's death.  Family and Social History:  There's no known family history of cardiovascular diseases. Her parents are deceased; her father died from colon cancer at the age of 70  and her mother had Alzheimer's disease and lived up to 79. Her younger sister  age 62  is healthy. Mrs. Johnson leads a rather sedentary lifestyle but has been working towards incorporating regular walks in her daily routine. She is mostly independent and copes well with activities of daily living but has been reporting feelings of loneliness and sadness post her friend's demise.  In a nutshell  stress cardiomyopathy or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a condition that primarily affects postmenopausal women and can be triggered by severe emotional stress. Mrs. Johnson's case underscores the significance of psychological stress contributing to physical ailments and emphasizes the importance of comprehensive care  intertwining physical health management with psychological counseling. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,31,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Susan G.  a 65-year-old Asian female  presents with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm and jaw after hearing about her son's sudden accidental death.   History:  Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and she is currently under medication with antihypertensives. She denies diabetes and any past incidents of myocardial infarctions. Her father had a history of heart failure at the age of 70.  Presenting Condition:  Upon admission  she was tachycardic with a heart rate of 115 beats per minute  and her blood pressure was 150/95 mm Hg. The physical examination was only significant for cardiac-related irregularities including an S4 gallop and a non-radiating pain in the midst chest area during palpation. She also reported associated shortness of breath. She does not smoke cigarettes  does not take illicit drugs and consumed alcohol socially.   Diagnostic Testing:  An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevations in the anterolateral leads consistent with acute myocardial ischemia  but her coronary angiogram results were negative for occlusions or stenosis. Troponin levels were mildly elevated at 2.0 ng/mL  unusual for an acute coronary event.   An echocardiogram showed reduced left ventricular function (LVEF 35%) and apical ballooning consistent with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM).   Diagnosis:  Given her recent significant emotional stress and characteristic cardiac findings  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as Broken Heart Syndrome.   Treatment:  She was treated with supportive care  including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. Given the short duration of onset  she was managed conservatively.  Prognosis:  While Ms. Susan's emotional status improved  her cardiac function is in the process of monitored recovery. The prognosis seems favorable as TCM is typically reversible  however  this depends on her emotional coping and her cardiac condition's response to the medications.   A psychiatric evaluation was recommended for help in dealing with the grief of her son's sudden death to avoid further complications.  This presentation mirrors the typical patient population diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  with a predilection for postmenopausal women  often triggered by extreme emotional or physical stress. TCM prevalence is particularly significant in women over the age of 55 with various studies indicating 90% of the cases occurring in women. Furthermore  genetic predisposition may play a role in TCM. Ethnic-wise  literature shows a high degree of underrepresentation  although limited data suggests potential underdiagnosis in the Asian population.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,32,Patient Case Presentation:  Demographics:  The patient is a 72-year-old Asian female.  Presenting Complaints:  She was brought to the emergency department with complaints of acute chest pain radiating to the left arm  associated with shortness of breath and significant emotional stress arising from the recent passing of her husband.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known case of well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has no history of ischemic heart disease nor does she smoke or drink alcohol.  Family History:  Her parents were both non-smokers and lived into their late 80s without any significant cardiac diseases. She has three siblings  one of whom has coronary artery disease.  Physical Examination:  On examination  she appeared anxious and was sweaty. Her blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  pulse rate was 90 beats/minute  and breath sounds were reduced bilaterally. Cardiac auscultation did not reveal any murmurs or irregular rhythm.  Investigations: Her lab results demonstrated raised troponin levels and ECG showed ST-segment elevation suggestive of a myocardial infarction. However  her coronary angiography did not reveal any significant obstruction in the coronary arteries  which would typically be seen in a classic myocardial infarction. An echocardiography revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle  which is not typical for myocardial infarction but suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Diagnosis: Based on the echocardiographic findings coupled with the patient's symptoms  an elevated troponin level  the emotional stress event  and normal angiography findings  a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made.  Plan:  The patient was managed with supportive care  including ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and psychological support to cope with her recent loss. Since her symptoms did not resolve completely  she was referred to a cardiologist for long-term follow-up care and management.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as “broken-heart syndrome ” predominantly affects postmenopausal women and can be triggered by severe emotional stress. Manifesting with acute chest pain and signs similar to myocardial infarction  it is differentiated by a lack of obstructive coronary artery disease on angiography and unique apical ballooning of the left ventricle. Though the mechanism is not entirely clear  excessive release of stress hormones leading to myocardial stunning is considered to be the pathophysiology. Like in this patient  treatment is usually supportive.  References: Prasad  A.  et al. (2008).

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,33,"Patient Presentation  Female Patient: Bailey T.  Age: 71  Race: Caucasian   Bailey is a retired schoolteacher who presented complaining of sudden  severe chest discomfort and shortness of breath  following the sudden passing of her husband a week ago. She has a history of well-controlled hypertension and a mild case of type II diabetes. She does not smoke or drink alcohol excessively  and she maintains a relatively balanced diet and moderate physical activity.  Past Medical History  Bailey was diagnosed with hypertension 12 years ago and has been on regular antihypertensive medication. Her diabetes was diagnosed five years ago  and she effectively manages it with oral hypoglycemic agents and lifestyle changes.  Family History  No history of cardiovascular disease was reported in her immediate family. Her father suffered from type II diabetes  and her mother had hypothyroidism.  Clinical Assessment and Diagnosis  On admission  Bailey had an elevated blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  and respiratory rate of 20 bpm. She appeared anxious and distressed. Electrocardiogram displayed ST-segment elevation  indicating myocardial ischemia.   Laboratory findings included significantly increased levels of cardiac troponin and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)  suggesting acute heart stress. The coronary angiogram showed no substantial evidence of coronary artery disease  which indicated no risk of a heart attack.  However  an echocardiogram and left ventriculogram showed that her heart's left ventricle had an abnormal contraction pattern  which is recognized as """"apical ballooning."""" This finding led to the diagnosis of """"Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy"""" (TC)  also known as """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Treatment & Progress  Bailey was treated with beta-blockers to decrease her heart rate and blood pressure  and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to enhance her heart's function and prevent further heart damage. The emotional stress induced by her husband's passing  causing TC was also addressed  placing her under counselling and providing support groups.  Follow-up   Bailey was scheduled for regular follow-ups every two weeks for cardiac function assessment. After three months  the echocardiogram showed that her left ventricle's function had significantly improved and was back to normal.  Discussion  Around 90% of reported Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy cases are in post-menopausal women aged between 58 and 75. Precipitating stressors frequently include sudden emotional or physical distress. Although Bailey had hypertension and type II diabetes  her major risk factor appeared to be the emotional stress from her husband's death. Close monitoring and supportive care are integral to her recovery  along with addressing her emotional wellbeing."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,34,Patient Introduction: The patient under discussion is a 68-year-old female  single  retired school teacher  and of Hispanic descent. She was previously diagnosed with hypertension and primary osteoporosis  controlled with medication: Amlodipine (5mg OD) and Alendronate (70mg weekly).  Presenting Complaint: The patient arrived in the emergency department (ED) complaining of a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. The pain onset was shortly after receiving news of her brother's sudden death.  Medical History: She has a known history of essential hypertension for the past nine years and primary osteoporosis diagnosed two years ago. She is allergic to Penicillin  which causes a rash. The patient denies any history of diabetes mellitus  dyslipidemia  or any thyroid disorders. She has also never smoked or consumed alcohol.  Family History: Her father had died at the age of 76 due to acute myocardial infarction  and her mother had passed away at 81 from complications of Alzheimer's disease. She also had a younger brother who recently passed away at 65 due to a car accident. None of her close family members had any history of heart failure  stroke  or cancer.  Physical Examination: On examination in the ED  her blood pressure was elevated (155/90 mmHg)  pulse rate was 110 beats per minute  and her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute. Her body mass index was noted to be within the normal range. She appeared anxious and was in obvious distress due to pain.  Investigations: The initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Cardiac enzymes were elevated  with Troponin at 1.0 ng/mL  clearly surpassing the upper reference limit. In the ED  emergent catheterization was performed which did not show any significant coronary artery disease.  Diagnosis & Management:  Given her symptoms  ECG changes  and catheterization findings  a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was suspected. This was later confirmed by a transthoracic echocardiogram  which showed apical ballooning and hyperkinesis of the basal segments of the left ventricle  reminiscent of the 'Octopus Pot' sign. The patient was managed with supportive therapy  including Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  Beta-blockers  and Aspirin. The emotional stress of bereavement was addressed by referring her to a clinical psychologist.  Conclusion: The patient illustrates several risk factors associated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  such as postmenopausal status  hypertension  and severe emotional stress. This case underscores the crucial importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in older women presenting with acute chest pain  especially in the context of emotional stress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,35,Patient Presentation: Name: Mrs. Ava Johnson Age: 68 years Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Marital Status: Widow Location: Boston  Massachusetts   Presenting Complaints:  Mrs. Johnson presented to the emergency department with anxiety  chest pain  and shortness of breath.   Past Medical History:  She is known to have hypertension controlled with medication  and is overweight with a BMI of 31 kg/m2. She has no history of ischemic heart disease  diabetes mellitus  or any other chronic illnesses. There is no history of mental illness  but intense chronic stress due to the death of her husband four months ago. She quit smoking 5 years ago after a 30-year history of cigarette use.  Family History:  Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 76; her mother had stroke at age 79  and has sibling with hypertension.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed mild pallor and anxiety. Breathing sounded normal but her heart sounds were a bit louder on auscultation. Her blood pressure was 149/89 mmHg  and heart rate was 98 bpm. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion. Troponin I level was high (0.8 ng/ml).  Investigations and Diagnosis: She was suspected with acute coronary syndrome and admitted to the cardiac care unit. Coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease  but left ventriculography indicated apical ballooning. This  combined with her emotional trigger  led to the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment and Outcome: Mrs. Johnson was managed conservatively with supportive care: beta blockers (metoprolol)  ACE inhibitors (lisinopril)  aspirin  and a statin (atorvastatin). Her chest pain resolved in next 48 hours  and improvement in cardiac function was seen on echocardiogram after 1 week. She was referred to a dietician and psychologist for continued support in managing her weight and stress levels.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or broken heart syndrome  predominantly affects postmenopausal women and can be triggered by emotional stress. Clinically  it may mimic acute coronary syndrome but shows characteristic findings on ventriculography or echocardiogram in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Although the prognosis in most cases is excellent  supportive care  prevention of complications  and emotional support are key to management.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,36,Patient Presentation:   Mrs. T  a 67-year-old  African-American single retired nurse  presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to her left arm and shortness of breath occurring for approximately six hours. In terms of past medical history  she has hypertension that is relatively well-controlled with lisinopril. Her other significant past medical history includes generalized anxiety disorder treated with sertraline.   Social history revealed increased stress due to the recent death of her only son a week ago. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She lives independently. The family history was slim; she mentioned that her mother passed away from stroke at age 75  and her father died at age 82 from coronary artery disease.   On physical examination  Mrs. T was alert but moderately distressed due to pain. Her oxygen saturation was 90% on room air. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-elevation mimicking myocardial infarction. However  upon further diagnostics via cardiac enzymes  echocardiogram  and coronary angiography  she was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which generally presents as a sudden apparent heart attack triggered by severe stress.  Management and Outcome:  She was managed with supportive care for heart failure  including oxygen therapy  furosemide  and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI). Mrs. T's condition gradually improved over the course of one week. She was discharged with close outpatient follow-up and a recommendation to a grief counselor to help manage the psychological stress she has been experiencing.   Discussion:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy  is relatively rare  diagnosing an estimated 1-2% of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome. It's more common in postmenopausal women and those exposed to significant emotional or physical stress. This case helps shed light on the diverse paths through which stress can cause physical harm. It also emphasizes the importance of an appropriate diagnostic approach to patients presenting with symptoms suggesting acute coronary syndrome.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,37,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old Hispanic female from Arizona  USA  who presented herself to the emergency department with severe chest pain that began suddenly while she was at home. The onset of symptoms began after the patient learned about the sudden death of her older son. Her past medical history includes controlled hypertension and her socio-economic status is middle class. The patient denies any alcohol or drug use but acknowledges being a former smoker  having quit about 15 years ago.  Medical History:  The patient is medically managed for hypertension and takes a daily dose of Lisinopril 10mg. She also has a history of osteoarthritis and depression  for which she takes Celecoxib 200mg and Sertraline 50mg respectively. She does not have a history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  asthma or any respiratory disease. The patient's last physical examination was six months ago and the results were normal with a BMI within the normal range. She has never had surgery and her immunizations are up to date.  Family History:  Her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with her father having died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 75. Her mother is 89 years old and has diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. One brother  aged 70  has a history of coronary artery disease and had a stent placed a year ago. Her oldest son  recently deceased  had been healthy. Her daughter is healthy.   Clinical Findings:  Initial examination reveals the patient to be in extreme distress  with excessive sweating and shaking. Her blood pressure was elevated at 180/96 mmHg  heart rate was rapid at 102 beats per minute  and respiratory rate at 26 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. There appears to be no obvious respiratory or abdominal findings  even though the patient seems slightly pale.  Diagnosis:  The clinical presentation and subsequent ECG which demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads made it rather conducive for a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. However  a coronary angiogram showed no significant stenosis or blockage. Based on her presentation – acute/recent strong emotional stressor  characteristic symptoms  ECG changes  and angiogram results – the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as 'Broken Heart Syndrome').  Plan:  The treatment plan involved managing the patient's symptoms by monitoring in a Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU)  supportive therapy  and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (to lower blood pressure)  and beta-blockers (to reduce potential for further heart damage). Psychological support to help her cope with her emotional stress was also part of the treatment plan.  Prognosis:  With appropriate supportive treatment  improvement in the patient's cardiac function is usually seen within weeks. The patient was advised to follow up closely with her primary care physician and cardiologist to monitor for recurrence  given that there's an estimated 5-10% recurrence rate.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,38,Subject: 65-year-old Asian Female  Diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Overview: Ms. Y  an Asian female  is a 65-year-old retired teacher from California. She is divorced and lives alone  with two adult children living out of state. She was presented to the emergency department after experiencing tightness in her chest and shortness of breath.   Past Medical History: Ms. Y has a history of diabetes mellitus and hyperthyroidism  but no known cardiac anomalies. She was diagnosed with Type II diabetes five years ago and has been managing it with medication and diet. She was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism last year. She is currently taking Metformin for her diabetes and Methimazole for her hyperthyroidism. She is a non-smoker and occasional drinker.  Family History: Her mother  who died at the age of 79  had a history of congestive cardiac failure. Her father died at 83 due to lung cancer with no known cardiac complications. Her older brother  currently 68 years old  was diagnosed with coronary artery disease at age 62.  Clinical Exam & Tests: Physical examination and vitals were taken  showing an irregular heart rate. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. Blood tests revealed elevated levels of cardiac enzymes consistent with myocardial injury. Echocardiography suggested reduced heart contractility with apical ballooning  which are typical features of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Assessment: Ms. Y's symptoms  physical examination  ECG  and Echocardiography results were all indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome. Given her profile of an older  post-menopausal woman  this diagnosis aligns with literature findings  as Asian women over 55 years old are commonly susceptible to takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Care plan: The patient was admitted to the hospital for monitoring and management  and she was given a beta-blocker  Carvedilol  to manage her irregular heart rate. She responded well to the treatment  with a reduction in chest pain. Her irregular heart rate was monitored closely. The patient is scheduled for regular follow-ups to monitor her heart function. She has also been referred to a counselor for stress management  given the strong emotional triggers associated with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Follow-up: Ms. Y has been advised to maintain regular check-ups with her primary caregiver. Her family members have been informed of the situation and will be providing additional support. An increase in physical activity and a balanced diet were also prescribed. She will also follow up with a cardiologist regularly to monitor her heart function.   Conclusion: This patient's case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy aligns with common demographic and etiological patterns studied in medical literature. The ongoing management plan aims to maintain cardiovascular stability whilst addressing potential emotional triggers. Extensive family support and stress management strategies form an integral part of her healthcare plan.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,39,"Patient Case Presentation: Narrative:  Mrs. L is a 65-year-old Asian woman who presented to the emergency room complaining of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. The pain  according to Mrs. L  came on suddenly after a heated argument with her neighbor. She was brought in by her daughter who revealed that Mrs. L has a history of hypertension managed with medication and she recently lost her husband  which has caused her significant emotional stress.  On examination  she appeared diaphoretic with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute and blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. Her BMI was calculated to be 27.9  which indicates that Mrs. L is overweight. Her initial EKG showed ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads. Her Troponins were elevated on admission  setting off concerns of an Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).  However  her cardiac catheterization showed no significant coronary artery disease. Instead  on the left ventriculogram  the characteristic heart shape of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was observed - a rounded bottom and narrow neck  akin to a Japanese octopus trap  hence the name. Further  her echocardiogram showed apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesis  both characteristic findings in Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  thereby ruling out AMI.  At admission  her medications included amlodipine 5 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Her only surgical history involved a cholecystectomy at age 45. She is a nonsmoker and does not consume alcohol. She has two children who are both healthy; her elder brother has a history of coronary artery disease.   Her blood cholesterol  triglycerides  liver enzymes  kidney function were all within normal limits. Further investigation revealed no signs of pheochromocytoma  an endocrine disease sometimes associated with TTC.  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken-heart syndrome """" is a transient cardiac syndrome that involves left ventricular apical akinesis  often seen in post-menopausal women following severe emotional stress. The pathophysiology is uncertain but is thought to involve high circulating catecholamines released during times of stress that stun the myocardium.  Management: Mrs. L was conservatively managed with just medication adjustments. She was started on a beta-blocker  with monitoring of cardiac enzymes  along with a repeat echocardiogram. Her symptoms and cardiac structure improved without the need for any surgical intervention.   She was recommended to continue her beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor was introduced. In addition  she was referred to bereavement counseling to manage her emotional stress and was advised on lifestyle modifications including weight management  a balanced diet  and regular exercise.  Follow-up:  A one-month follow-up after discharge showed that Mrs. L was doing well without any recent episodes of chest pain. Her repeat echocardiogram showed a return to normal heart function and her blood pressure is now more adequately controlled.   Conclusion:  This case demonstrates how intense emotional stress  such as grief  can result in severe cardiac symptoms related to takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The absence of significant coronary artery disease  the occurrence of a severe psychological stressor  and characteristic findings on echocardiogram secured the diagnosis for Mrs. L. Her case is consistent with the demographic representation frequently seen in the disease: middle-aged to elder women post a stressful event."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,40,"Patient Presentation  Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian woman named Ms. Wilson  living in Queens  New York. She is a retired school teacher and lives alone. The patient's primary language is English  and she perceives her health status as fair.  Medical History: Ms. Wilson has a known history of hypertension for which she has been on Lisinopril 10mg Daily for the past 10 years. She also suffers from obesity  with a BMI of 30.4  and has reported a history of chronic stress and anxiety for which she takes a low-dose Sertraline. Her history also shows that she smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day for the last 30 years. She does not have a history of excessive alcohol drinking and denies any illicit drug use. She went through menopause at age 55 and is not on any hormonal replacement therapy.  Family History: Ms. Wilson has a family history of cardiovascular disease. Her father died of a heart attack at age 72  and her mother suffered from congestive heart failure and died at age 80. There's no known family history of malignancies or other inheritable disease.  Presenting Issue: Ms. Wilson presented to the Emergency Department complaining of acute chest pain and shortness of breath following a heated argument with her neighbor. The pain was described as severe  radiating to the left arm and associated with nausea.   Evaluation and Diagnosis: Considering the intense nature of the patient's symptoms  a myocardial infarction was initially suspected. However  the troponin levels were moderately elevated  not suggestive of a typical heart attack. An EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  further leading to suspecting a cardiac event.  An emergency coronary angiogram ruled out significant coronary artery disease. However  an echocardiogram showed significant left ventricular dysfunction with balloon-like dilation of the apex  akin to takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Treatment and Outcome: The patient was managed with beta-blockers (Metoprolol)  ACE inhibitors (continued on Lisinopril)  and Aspirin. Her anxiety and stress symptoms were managed by increasing the Sertraline dosage. She also started counseling for emotional support and stress management techniques.  The patient was discharged after stabilizing her symptoms. During subsequent follow-up visits  her symptoms had resolved  and an echocardiogram confirmed improved cardiac function.   Future Concerns: Given her high stress level  Ms. Wilson is at risk of recurrence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patient education on stress management  smoking cessation  weight management  and regular mental health counseling are necessary as part of her ongoing care. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,41,Case Presentation:  Patient Details: 'Mrs. A'  a 72 years old Asian woman  presented at the Emergency Department (ED).   Chief Complaint: She reported intense  sudden onset chest pain  and shortness of breath while facing a highly stressful family disagreement.   Past Medical History: Mrs. A is a nonsmoker and nondrinker with a history of well-controlled hypertension  and no history of coronary artery disease or any significant cardiac diseases. She has a record of hyperthyroidism under treatment with Levothyroxine.  Home Meds: Levothyroxine  and Losartan for hypertension.  Physical Examination: Her BP was 170/95 mmHg  heart rate was irregular at 110 bpm  and SaO2 was 95% on room air. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular rhythm  with no murmurs or gallops; lung auscultation revealed clear and equal bilateral air entry.  Family History: No reported family history of ischemic heart diseases or other major health disorders reported. She is a widow for eight years and has two healthy adult children.  Investigation: Initial ECG performed in ED indicated ST-elevation in the precordial leads. The lab tests showed a slightly raised level of cardiac enzyme creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) but a significantly higher troponin I level. Quick bedside echo detected a reduced ejection fraction (EF 40%) with left ventricular (LV) apical ballooning and hyperkinesis of the basal regions  an image compatible with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Diagnosis: Considering the clinical presentation  ECG findings  and echocardiography  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as “broken heart syndrome”.  Treatment: She was admitted to CCU. Initial management included Oxygen therapy  aspirin  beta-blockers  and IV nitrates as well as Lorazepam for anxiety control.  Progress: After five days  her symptoms improved. Repeat echo showed improved LV function with EF 55%. The attending doctor arranged follow-up appointments and psychological counseling emphasizing stress management techniques post-discharge.  This case presentation reiterates that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often linked to sudden intense emotional or physical stress  is not uncommon in elderly women. The disease can mimic myocardial infarction  both clinically and electrocardiographically  creating diagnostic challenges. It is a critical reminder for professionals to bear in mind the significance of the psychosocial aspects in the management of such conditions.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,42,"Patient Presentation:   Mr. Ramirez  a 75-year-old Hispanic male with history of hypertension  diabetes type II  acid reflux disease  and no family history of heart disease  presented with severe chest pain following the unexpected death of his wife.  Clinical History: His vitals on arrival - BP - 150/90 mmHg  heart rate - 110/min  respiratory rate - 17/min and temperature - 98.4F. Recent hepatitis panel was unremarkable. No history of alcohol or tobacco use. He has been compliant with his medications that include metformin  lisinopril and omeprazole. Mr. Ramirez reports increased stress and anxiety since his wife's passing 2 weeks ago.  Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. Ramirez appeared anxious and in discomfort. Heart examination revealed tachycardia with no additional heart sounds or murmurs. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and his abdomen was soft and non-tender. His lower extremities showed no signs of edema. The rest of his physical examination results were within normal limits.  Investigations: An ECG was immediately ordered and displayed a ST elevation but a subsequent Troponin I level was within normal limits  contradicting a typical myocardial infarction. An emergency cardiac catheterization was performed  which displayed no critical coronary blockage  but ventriculography showed apical akinesia and basal hypercontractility suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) or """"broken heart syndrome"""". TCM was confirmed by transthoracic echocardiogram. Further blood work revealed normal lipids and an HbA1c of 6.5 indicating good control of his diabetes.  Treatment  Progress and Prognosis: Mr. Ramirez was managed conservatively with continuation of his current medications including ACE inhibitors and beta blockers along with new prescriptions for short-term anxiolytics. Cardiology follow-up was arranged to closely monitor his condition.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is a transient heart condition often triggered by stressful situations  such as the loss of a loved one. TCM typically manifests with chest pain and shortness of breath and initially appears like a heart attack. However  unlike a heart attack  there's no evidence of blocked heart arteries in takotsubo cardiomyopathy and it is not lethal. It usually reverses itself in days or weeks. Nevertheless  patients with TCM require careful monitoring and supportive care. Stress management and control of risk factors are important in preventing recurrent episodes. This case portrays that the psychological and physiological stress can cause significant cardiac impact  importantly when other risk factors like age  hypertension and diabetes are present."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,43,Case Presentation  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old Asian female named Mrs. K. On statistical grounds  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) predominantly impacts postmenopausal women  with Asians having a relatively higher prevalence.    Chief Complaint: Mrs. K was admitted to the emergency room (ER) presenting with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  and shortness of breath. The symptoms had started suddenly two hours prior while hearing shocking news about the death of a close friend.  Past Medical History: Mrs. K has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years. She's on Metformin  Lisinopril  and a daily aspirin regimen. She had a cholecystectomy ten years ago and occasional anxiety managed by a psychotherapist. There was no previous record of any cardiovascular disease.  Family History: There's no history of heart disease in the family. Her parents are deceased due to unrelated causes (mother-dementia  father-CA lung)  and she has a younger brother managing hypertension.  Social History: She's a retired school teacher  widowed for 5 years. Mrs. K has never smoked  has occasional alcohol consumption  and has been largely sedentary since retirement.  Clinical Examination:  In the ER  Mrs. K appeared anxious. Her blood pressure was 170/100 mmHg  pulse rate 110 bpm  regular  and respiratory rate 24 breaths/minute. An ECG was performed  which showed ST elevations in the anterior leads and T wave inversions with QT prolongation  mimicking the appearance of an acute myocardial infarction.  Laboratory Tests and Diagnosis: Considering the symptoms and ECG changes  Myocardial Infarction (MI) was suspected  so cardiac enzymes were sent immediately. Surprisingly  Troponin I levels were only slightly elevated. Echocardiography demonstrated apical ballooning of the left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction (about 35%)  which didn't correlate with any single coronary artery territory. Coronary angiography was performed to rule out atherosclerotic coronary disease  but all arteries were found to be clean.   Based on her symptoms  ECG changes  echocardiogram findings  negligible elevation in cardiac enzymes  and clean coronary angiogram findings  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome.  Treatment & Management: She was started on selective beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and anxiolytics  along with supportive therapy. Her post-admission course was uneventful  and her chest pain and dyspnea improved over 48 hours. Upon a repeat echo prior to discharge  there was marked improvement in left ventricular function. Mrs. K was referred to a structured cardiac rehabilitation program and psychiatric consultation to better cope with stress.  Prognosis: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally considered reversible within weeks to months. Mrs. K was advised regular follow-up with cardiac rehabilitation and a clinical psychologist.   In conclusion  this case presentation highlights the significance of recognizing TC as a differential diagnosis in patients with suspected MI  especially post-menopausal females following sudden emotional stress. Health professionals need to incorporate a balanced perspective  both emotional and physiological  in their treatment approach.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,44,Patient Details:  Mrs. Maria Gonzales  a 65-year-old Hispanic woman  who lives a retired life in Austin  Texas with her husband and two dogs. She has two children  both of whom live out of the state. Prior to her diagnosis  she was quite active  participating in the local community gardening club and volunteering at a nearby food bank.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Gonzales has a history of controlled hypertension  for which she has been taking Lisinopril 15mg once daily for the last six years. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago and maintains her blood sugar levels well with Metformin and diet control. She has been maintaining a BMI of 25.7. She has no history of heart disease or stroke  but her father had his first heart attack at the age of 58.   Presenting Complaint:  Recently  Mrs. Gonzales presented at the ER with severe chest pain  mimicking a heart attack. The pain started after she received the news of her daughter's severe accident. Following a suspected myocardial infarction  she underwent a series of diagnostic tests. Her EKG showed an ST elevation  and her cardiac biomarkers were slightly elevated.  On performing an angiography  no significant blockages in her coronary arteries were detected. However  a subsequent echocardiography displayed an abnormality in the left ventricle function with apical ballooning  a key diagnostic feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Broken heart syndrome).  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is typically triggered by severe emotional or physical stress. Mrs. Gonzales’ condition appears to have been triggered by the severe emotional stress from hearing about her daughter's accident. The demographic most susceptible to this condition is postmenopausal women  making Mrs. Gonzales' occurrence very typical.  Management:  Mrs. Gonzales was managed with standard heart failure medication including ACE inhibitors and Beta Blockers. In addition  she was advised on stress management strategies. She was also referred to a psychiatrist for additional support to manage her emotional stress. Her clinical follow-up after a month showed improvement as her left ventricle was regaining its normal function.   Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential for women presenting with chest pain  particularly in the setting of severe emotional stress. As the patient had an excellent outcome  this case also demonstrates the reversibility of ventricular dysfunction in takotsubo cardiomyopathy when managed appropriately.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,45,Patient Profile: Mrs. Linda Carter  a 65-year-old African American female  presented at the ER of our hospital. She resides in Brooklyn  New York  is retired  a widow  and has three adult children. Mrs. Carter is a former elementary school teacher and has no history of alcohol or drug abuse.  Presentation: Mrs. Carter presented with acute chest pain  shortness of breath  dizziness  and nausea. She was under a lot of emotional stress  having recently lost her husband to cancer.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Carter reported a history of Type-2 diabetes and hypertension. Both conditions were well-managed with medication (Metformin for diabetes; Lisinopril for hypertension). She is non-smoker and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to arthritis. She has no known allergies  no history of surgeries  and no previous diagnoses of cardiac conditions.  Family History: Mother died at 70 due to stroke  and father died at 75 due to heart disease. Her elder sister has hypertension and her younger brother is in the early stages of kidney disease.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  Mrs. Carter demonstrated distress and increased respiratory rate. Initial vital signs were blood pressure: 160/90 mmHg  heart rate: 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation: 95% on room air.   Diagnostic Assessment: Her EKG demonstrated ST-segment elevation  and her initial troponin I level was elevated at 3.2 ng/mL. An echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease  ruling out acute coronary syndrome.  Treatment: The primary focus was on relieving Mrs. Carter's symptoms and managing her blood pressure. She was managed with aspirin  beta-blockers (metoprolol)  and ACE inhibitors. She also was treated with supportive therapy including oxygen and analgesics.  Progress/Outcome: Mrs. Carter's symptoms gradually improved over five days. Repeat echocardiogram showed resolution of the ventricular dysfunction  and she was discharged with outpatient cardiology follow-up in a week.  Plan: Mrs. Carter was encouraged to continue her medications  follow a low salt diet  and increase her physical activity as tolerated.   Psycho-social Support: To address her emotional stress  Mrs. Carter was referred to a therapist for supportive counseling and was encouraged to attend a local bereavement group.  This case intensifies the need for clinicians to recognize presentations of stress-induced (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy  especially in postmenopausal women who are under emotional stress. Timely intervention and management are crucial to improve outcomes.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,46,Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 68-year-old African American woman presenting to the emergency room (ER) with symptoms of acute chest pain and shortness of breath. The symptoms started abruptly while she was attended a funeral  a stressful event she was mourning deeply.  Her past medical history includes hypertension  diabetes mellitus type 2  and hyperlipidemia -- all considered to be under control with medication. She has been compliant with her medications  including an ACE inhibitor  a statin and an oral hypoglycemic agent. She had no records of previous myocardial infarction or heart disease  and she does not smoke or drink alcohol. She has been leading an active life  enjoying walking her dog in the park every morning.  Her family history indicates that her father suffered from coronary artery disease (CAD) and passed away following myocardial infarction at 72 years. Her mother passed away due to stroke at 78 years. Her two older siblings are healthy.   On her physical examination  she appeared anxious and diaphoretic. Her heart rate was 110 bpm  BP was 150/90 mmHg. Her EKG showed ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads V2-V4 and mildly elevated troponin-I.  With her complaint of sudden chest pain after emotional stress  ST-segment elevation on her EKG and a mildly elevated troponin-I  our primary concern was acute myocardial infarction. However  the patient was rapidly taken for coronary angiography  which demonstrated no blockages in the coronary arteries. Left ventriculogram  however  showed apical ballooning consistent with stress-induced (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy.  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is more common in postmenopausal women and can be triggered by severe emotional stress. It can mimic symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome but coronary angiography usually unveils patent coronary arteries.  Her condition was managed conservatively with an ACE inhibitor  beta-blocker  and supportive treatment. Our plan includes conservative management with reassurance  continued medications  and outpatient follow-ups with cardiology.   The patient was placed on a cardiac monitoring unit and her hospital course was uneventful. She improved over the next few days and was discharged from the hospital in stable condition. She was reminded to take her medications regularly and to seek professional help in dealing with emotional stress.   This case highlights the unique presentation and management of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  an under-recognized and under-diagnosed form of heart disease  especially in the setting of emotionally stressful events.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,47,"Patient Presentation:   Patient Information: Mrs. A. Kingston  female  aged 63  African American  living with her retired husband in Portland  Oregon.  Presentation: Presented to the emergency room (ER) with severe chest pain mid-sternum  radiating to the left arm. Associated symptoms included shortness of breath and a sense of impending doom.  Past Medical History: Hypertension for seven years  well-controlled with Amlodipine 5mg once daily. No history of diabetes or any other significant systemic illness. She has a previous psychiatric history of severe  chronic anxiety and occasional panic attacks  managed well with SSRI (Sertraline) and psychological therapies.  Family History: Father-deceased at 76 of ischemic heart disease. Mother is alive and well at 85 in a nursing home with Alzheimer's disease. Two grown-up children with no major health issues.  Clinical Examination: Vitals showed a blood pressure of 160/90  pulse rate 110/ min  respiratory rate 22/min  and SpO2 95% in room air. Cardiac auscultation revealed no abnormal sounds. Heart sounds were regular with no murmurs and her chest was clear on auscultation.  Investigations: Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) findings indicated ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  suggestive of an anterior wall myocardial infarction (MI). Blood investigations revealed mildly elevated cardiac enzymes. Other laboratory results including CBC  liver function tests  renal function tests  and electrolytes were within normal limits.  Hospital course: The patient was promptly admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) considering a potential MI. Given the early presentation  she was immediately taken for coronary angiography  which surprisingly showed no significant coronary artery blockage. An echocardiogram then revealed apical akinesia with basal hyper contraction  the classic """"octopus pot"""" appearance suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management: Mrs. Kingston was managed conservatively with beta-blockers (Metoprolol 12.5mg twice daily) and ACE inhibitors (Lisinopril 2.5mg once daily). Her chest pain subsided gradually over the next 24 hours. Her cardiac enzymes trended down  and an echocardiogram repeated after a week showed resolution of the wall motion abnormalities  confirming the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Follow up and Prognosis: Mrs. Kingston was discharged with a prescription for the aforementioned drugs and instructions for follow-up in the cardiology outpatient clinic after two weeks. She was also referred back to her psychiatrist for better control of her anxiety symptoms as these could have triggered the event.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken-heart syndrome'  is often triggered by physical or emotional stress. The demographics of our patient fits with the literature where it is predominantly found in postmenopausal women with a higher prevalence in those with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. Our patient highlights the importance of recognizing this syndrome  which mimics MI but does not carry the same risk if properly managed and prevented  especially by controlling the inciting stressors.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,48,"Patient Background:  Patient S.M. is a 67-year-old  postmenopausal Caucasian female. She has a long history of hypertension that was managed through lifestyle modifications and daily medication intake. Additionally  she has uncontrolled type II diabetes and was an active smoker until about seven years ago. She lives alone and recently lost her son in a motorcycle accident. S.M. denies any family history of myocardial infarction  stroke  or any other cardiovascular disorder. She also doesn't have any history or symptoms suggestive of obstructive coronary artery disease.   Presenting Problem:  S.M. presented with severe chest pain and sudden onset dyspnea. The symptoms occurred at rest and were described as comparable to """"an elephant sitting on my chest."""" She also reported feeling nauseous and fatigued. These symptoms increased after the news of her son's sudden death two days ago. The patient has no history of similar episodes.  Clinical Findings:  Relevant laboratory investigations revealed slightly elevated troponin T and creatine kinase MB fraction  as well as combative cardiogenic shock. An urgent electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed ST-segment elevation in anterior lead. An emergent transthoracic echocardiogram noted regional wall motion abnormality. The ejection fraction (EF) was 35%  down from 52% four months ago. Left ventricular angiography indicated apical ballooning  typical of a takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis:  Based on the patient's clinical presentation  electrocardiography  and angiography  she was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome.  Treatment:  Treatment was initiated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and antiplatelet agents. Additionally  the patient was referred to a psychologist for supportive counselling due to her bereavement.  Follow-up and Management:  S.M. was placed under close follow-ups every 2 weeks for heart function tests. After a 3-month follow-up appointment  there was a significant restoration in heart function as her EF increased to 52%. The patient displayed positive behavioral changes owing to the psychological intervention  which optimistically would reduce the likelihood of takotsubo cardiomyopathy recurrence.  This case presentation emphasizes how acute emotional stressors can lead to the development of takotsubo cardiomyopathy even in patients without a significant family history of cardiovascular disease. It also underscores the importance of not only focusing on the physical signs and symptoms but also addressing the psychological component of patient care  especially in stress-induced disorders."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,49,Patient Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Identification  Mrs. J  a 65-year-old Caucasian female  retired teacher  presented with severe chest pain of 6-hour duration. She lives in Seattle  Washington  with her husband in a middle-class residential neighborhood.  Past Medical History  She reported no prior history of heart diseases or cardiac procedures. She has been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes and managed with metformin and amlodipine for the past ten years. She has been non-smoker throughout her life and admits mild to moderate alcohol use.  Family History  No extensive family history of heart disease  though her mother had hypertension  and her father died of stroke at the age of 70. She has one younger brother living with type 2 diabetes. Her two children are healthy.  Presenting Complaint  Mrs. J was brought to the emergency room by her husband because of the sudden onset of chest pain following an emotional distress at home. The pain  described as heavy and crushing  was in the central part of the chest and radiated to the left arm.  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Diagnosis  Initial impression was acute coronary syndrome  which was supported by elevated troponin levels (2.1 ng/mL)  and the EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior-lateral leads. However  immediate coronary angiography demonstrated open coronary arteries with no sign of coronary artery disease. Left ventriculography demonstrated characteristic apical ballooning  with contraction at the base  consistent with a diagnosis of takotsubo (stress-induced) cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome  which occurs predominantly in postmenopausal women and can manifest following emotional or physical stress.  Treatment Plan   Mrs. J was immediately initiated on standard post-myocardial infarction medications  including aspiration therapy  beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and statins. However  dual antiplatelet therapy was omitted given no stent placement. Her symptoms improved significantly with medications.  Follow-up and Prognosis   At a 2-week follow-up visit  echocardiography demonstrated normalization of the left ventricular function suggestive of the transient nature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient was counseled about potential triggers and the benefit of stress management techniques to prevent recurrence. She was also advised to continue the prescribed medication regimen and regular follow-up for her chronic conditions.  In summary  this case highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain  particularly in postmenopausal women  with a history of recent emotional stress  and the need to have a comprehensive treatment plan for successful recovery.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,50,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: The subject is a 67-year-old African American woman with a past medical history of hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and anxiety disorder but no history of heart disease. She resides in Bronx  New York  living independently with her spouse and has a family history of hypertension in both mother and father  but no reports of heart disease in immediate family. The subject is a non-smoker  consumes alcohol moderately and has a body mass index (BMI) of 29  which classifies her as overweight.  Presenting Complaint: The patient initially presented to an outpatient clinic with severe chest pain  palpitations  and shortness of breath. She reported that these symptoms started abruptly an hour after receiving the news of her brother’s untimely death.  Examination: Upon examination  blood pressure was noted to be high (150/90 mmHg) and heart rate was irregular (110 beats per minute). On auscultation  a three-component high-pitched “triple gallop” rhythm was noted  indicative of heart failure.  Investigations: An Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-elevation in the precordial leads. Subsequent lab investigations revealed a significantly increased troponin level (1.0 ng/mL  reference range 0-0.04 ng/mL)  suggesting myocardial injury. Serial cardiac enzyme testing showed a peak troponin I level of 2.5 ng/mL after 12 hours of admission  after which it started to decrease. An echocardiogram indicated reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (40%  normal >55%) with apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesis  suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management and Outcome: The initial management included administering aspirin  nitroglycerin  and starting on a beta-blocker for rate control. The patient's symptoms started improving within 48 hours  and repeat ECH after 2 weeks showed the recovery of the left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 60%.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is commonly seen in post-menopausal women following extreme stress. Our patient’s presentation was typical and suggestive of this condition. With an increasing body of evidence pointing towards its link with stress and anxiety disorders  it is important to include psychiatric assessment and stress management in the comprehensive management of such patients. Proper counseling and treatment of underlying anxiety disorder  in addition to standard heart failure management  can prevent future episodes of the condition.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,51,Patient Profile: Mrs. Isabel Martin  a 74-year-old Caucasian female  presented with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She lives in Portland  Oregon  USA.   Medical history: Has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She is a habitual smoker and quit two years back. No history of illicit drug usage is documented. She has no significant surgical history. Her medications include lisinopril for hypertension and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.  Family History: She has a familial history of ischemic heart disease; her father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 62. Her mother had type 2 diabetes. She has two children  both in good health.  Onset of current symptoms: She reports her symptoms began suddenly just a few hours after learning of her husband's sudden death.  Examination: On examination  she was in clear distress  her blood pressure was low (90/50 mmHg)  heart rate was elevated (110 bpm) and her oxygen saturation was 95% while breathing ambient air. EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  raising a suspicion of an anterior myocardial infarction. However  a subsequent angiogram showed no significant blockages in her coronary arteries.  Investigations and diagnosis: Levels of troponin  a cardiac enzyme  were elevated which is a typical finding following a heart attack. Upon echocardiogram  there was a notable ballooning and weakening of the left ventricle  and mid-segmental dyskinesia with apical ballooning  giving the characteristic “takotsubo” or “octopus trap” appearance. A cardiac MRI echoed these results  leading to the definitive diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as Broken Heart Syndrome.   Management: In the ICU  she was given supportive care including IV fluids and low-dose Beta blockers. Her blood pressure and heart rate stabilized and she reported a significant reduction in her chest pain.   Discussion: TCM is commonly precipitated by severe emotional stress  which Mrs. Martin experienced for the loss of her husband. Although it often mimics a heart attack  TCM does not involve blocked heart arteries  which were absent in this patient. The incidence of TCM is much higher in postmenopausal women as compared to men.  This case underlines the need for physicians to recognize the distinctive features of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  and differentiate it from the more common acute coronary syndrome given their similar presentations but differing management strategies and long-term implications. Mrs. Martin will continue with the beta-blockers and be followed up by the outpatient cardiology department.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,52,Patient Presentation  Patient Demographics: The patient is an African-American woman of 66 years. She is a recently retired school teacher  a non-smoker  moderate drinker  and follows a balanced diet. She lives alone but has a strong support network of neighbors  family and friends.  Medical History: She is known to have hypertension and mild osteoarthritis of the knees. Her blood pressure control has been suboptimal despite medication. She is pre-diabetic but not on any medication as she is managing it through diet and lifestyle modification. She was last seen by an ophthalmologist for her increasing need for reading glasses.  Current Presentation: She presented at the emergency department with severe chest pain  dyspnea and sweating following the sudden death of her eldest son  a military serviceman. The pain was sudden  crushing and mimicked symptoms of a heart attack. EKG  echocardiogram  and troponin levels pointed to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome). She showed features of apical ballooning but her arteries had no signs of blockages  echoing the diagnosis.  Family History: Her father had died from stroke at 70 years and her mother of breast cancer at 65. Her only sibling  an elder brother  is hypertensive and is on treatment. There is no known family history of heart disease.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is often triggered by severe emotional stress. In her case  it appears to be the sudden tragic death of her son. Higher prevalence rate of TCM is observed in post-menopausal women  making her a typical case. With her current medical conditions including hypertension  she had increased risk of developing heart disease. The prompt diagnosis helped in preventing any major complications and the patient was started on beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors and anti-anxiety medication. Additionally  counseling was also advised to help her cope up with the stress and grief.  Conclusion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  though transient  can cause severe cardiac dysfunction. The importance of recognizing and treating this condition promptly is paramount. This case highlights the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in post-menopausal women presenting with chest pain  especially during extremely stressful circumstances.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,53,"Patient Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  I. Introduction  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to the emergency department with typical chest pain accompanied by palpitations and dyspnea. Prior to her admission  she had no significant past medical history except for hypertension and mild dyslipidemia  managed by a low-dose beta-blocker and statins respectively.   II. Demographics  Her socioeconomic status is characterized as middle class; she is a retired school teacher  a widow for the last ten years  and a nonsmoker. She adheres to a balanced Mediterranean-type diet  has a BMI of 25.2  and does mild physical exercise several days per week.   III. Family History  The patient's family history is significant for ischemic heart disease; her father died of myocardial infarction  and her brother has undergone angioplasty.   IV. Clinical Course  The patient has a poor tolerance for stress deriving from her husband's death a decade ago  which was considered a trigger for a potential underlying predisposition. She was assessed with a PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire) and it confirmed moderate depression. After her routine annual physical examination two months prior  her ECG and general blood work-up were normal.   Her onset of severe stress was triggered by her perceived fear of an imminent """"second wave"""" of COVID-19. This was followed by chest pain which led to her hospitalization. ECG changes showed ST-elevation in the precordial leads. An echo revealed a significant reduction in left ventricular function as well as apical akinesia  leading to clinical suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Angiography excluded significant coronary artery disease. Ventriculography confirmed the typical 'octopus pot' appearance. Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated. Brain natriuretic peptide was significantly elevated as is typical in takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients. Her symptoms resolved completely after she was managed conservatively. After counseling  she was started on an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) for her underlying depression.  V. Prognosis  The patient was rehabilitated and discharged with advice for follow-up visits for reassessment of her left ventricular function. As takotsubo cardiomyopathy is typically reversible  full recovery is expected.  This case emphasizes the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential in post-menopausal women with chest pain and unexplained ST-elevation  especially when associated with stress or emotional triggers. Further studies are needed to examine the potential genetic predisposition in such cases. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,54,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old Hispanic female presenting with severe chest pain and shortness of breath.   Past Medical History: The patient is known to have a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and mild obesity. She also had a left-sided mastectomy for breast cancer two years prior  with oncologic follow-ups showing no signs of recurrence to date. She quit smoking 20 years ago. She has no history of alcohol or substance abuse.   Demographics: She is a widow with two adult children  living alone since her husband's death five years ago. She recently retired from a stressful administrative job in a local hospital.   Family History: Her parents are deceased  but her father had coronary artery disease and underwent a bypass surgery at an older age  while her mother had a stroke at an older age. She has two siblings and both have hypertension  although otherwise healthy.  Presenting Complaint and Clinical Findings: The patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain radiating to her back and associated with dyspnea. The chest pain was similar to previous instances of angina  but more severe in intensity. On physical examination  she was in apparent distress and vital signs revealed mild tachycardia and hypertension.  Investigations and Diagnosis: An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment elevations in the precordial leads. Initial blood tests showed elevated cardiac enzymes  specifically troponin  suggesting a myocardial injury. A prompt coronary angiography showed no significant epicardial coronary artery disease. Subsequent echocardiography displayed apical ballooning of the left ventricle  with basal hyperkinesis  leading to a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as broken heart syndrome.  Clinical Course: Given the suspected diagnosis  her management initially included aspirin  clopidogrel  and nitroglycerin. After confirmation of TCM  the management was revised to include heart failure management with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. Over the course of her hospitalization  the patient's condition stabilized and improved with conservative management.  Clinico-Pathological Correlation & Discussion: The symptoms the patient presented with mimic those of an acute coronary syndrome  but in TCM  the heart arteries are not occluded. Her recent history of emotional stress (retirement) combined with her sex and age related risk factors are characteristic of individuals likely to present with TCM. Her history of breast cancer raises the possibility that her TCM is a long-term effect of cancer therapy  which warrants further research.  This case exemplifies the importance of maintaining a high level of suspicion for TCM in postmenopausal women presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome  particularly in those with a recent history of physical or emotional stress. It also illustrates the role of comprehensive history-taking and proper investigation in arriving at a diagnosis.   This case presentation provides a comprehensive understanding of TCM from onset to recovery  serving as a beneficial learning tool in assessing patients with chest pain. It also demonstrates how one diagnosis can mimic another  and that clinicians must be aware of atypical presentations of common conditions. Further  it raises interesting questions on the potential link between cancer  stress  and heart disease.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,55,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Jasmine Thompson  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presents in the emergency department with severe chest pain and dyspnea following an intense argument with her neighbor. Her medical history reveals controlled hypertension and Type II diabetes mellitus. She has no history of coronary artery disease. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. Her family history revealed her mother had a myocardial infarction at the age of 76 and passed away at the age of 82 due to complications associated with congestive heart failure. Her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and passed away at the age of 78.   Chief Complaint:  Ms. Thompson mainly complains of sudden severe chest pain  discomfort in her left arm  and difficulty breathing. She described the pain as a 'heavy' feeling in her chest  similar to someone sitting on it. She also reported feeling excessively tired and restless for a week.  Clinical Findings:  While at the emergency room  initial cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia with a rate of 110 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg. Auscultation of the heart revealed no murmurs or gallops. Her respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. The physical examination was unremarkable  except for mild leg edema bilaterally.  Diagnostic assessment:  The preliminary electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation  usually observed in patients with acute coronary syndrome. However  subsequent coronary angiography showed no evidence of any coronary artery obstruction. Echocardiogram revealed decreased wall motion in the apex and mid portion of the left ventricle. Her troponin I levels were slightly elevated. In light of these findings  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment:  Ms. Thompson was managed with standard heart failure medications  including beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The patient's symptoms gradually reduced over a period of days. She was counseled about symptom recognition  when to seek medical assistance  and stress management techniques to prevent similar episodes in the future.  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy typically precipitated by severe emotional or physiological stress. Though it is more common in post-menopausal women  it can happen irrespective of age. Prognosis is generally good with proper management  although complications can arise in some cases. Stress management thus plays a crucial role in these patients' management along with standard heart failure medications. The case of Ms. Thompson emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive assessment of chest pain  recognizing that not all presentations of ST-segment elevation represent acute coronary syndromes. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,56,"Patient Presentation:  Patient Details: Mrs. Jones is a 68-year-old African American woman  recently widowed.  Past Medical History: She has no history of smoking  alcohol  or drug abuse. She has managed diabetes and hypertension. There is no history of coronary artery disease or heart failure. She previously underwent surgery for benign breast tumor.  Presenting Complaint: Symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath that began two days ago following the death of her husband.  Family History: Her mother died of stroke in her seventies  and her father died of heart attack in his sixties. She has two brothers; one is healthy while the other has hypertension.  Social History: She is a retired teacher  lives alone  and has a daughter who stays in a different city.   Subjective Information: Mrs. Jones says she has been feeling increasingly stressed and overwhelmed by the loss of her husband  with symptoms worsening in the last two days.  Objective Data: Her blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg  heart rate was 90 bpm  and oxygen saturation was 94% at room air. Physical examination was notable for mild distress related to chest discomfort.  Investigations: An electrocardiogram showed non-specific ST-segment changes but no ST-segment elevation. Cardiac biomarkers including troponin were elevated. A transthoracic echocardiography showed decreased ejection fraction with akinesis in the apex of the left ventricle along with hyperkinesis at the base  creating the appearance of a ‘takotsubo.’  Management and Treatment: The patient was admitted to the cardiac care unit and began treatment with beta blockers. Diabetes and hypertension were managed with insulin and antihypertensive medication  respectively. Her psychological stress was also addressed by referring her to elderly care support groups  and initiating grief counseling and psychotherapy.  Follow-up and Prognosis: Mrs. Jones showed significant improvement upon follow-up after 2 months. Her chest discomfort had decreased substantially and repeat echo showed improved ventricular function. She was advised regular follow up with cardiology and psychiatry.  Brief Summary: This case represents takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome """" seen in a 68-year-old African American female with a recent bereavement. This disorder  often precipitated by intense emotional or physical stress  commonly demonstrates characteristic changes on echocardiogram and can significantly impact patients without prior known heart disease.   This reflects the literature that postmenopausal women are the most commonly affected by takotsubo cardiomyopathy  and reinforces the importance of recognizing the psychiatric/psychological aspects in managing these patients. Regular follow-ups and comprehensive care involving cardiology and psychiatry proved beneficial in her case."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,57,Patient Profile  Name: Anne Gomez Age: 65 Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Job: Retired School Teacher Demographics: Lives alone. Divorced with 3 adult children. Location: Michigan  USA  Case Presentation:  Anne Gomez  a 65-year-old caucasian woman  recently retired from her work as a school teacher  presented at the cardiology department of a local suburban Michigan hospital with symptoms including severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and light-headedness. The initial symptoms started several hours after Anne learned about the sudden death of her elder brother  suggesting a potential trigger of intense emotional stress.   Past Medical History:  Anne has a history of hypertension and borderline type 2 diabetes. She was diagnosed with these conditions about 12 years ago when she reported consistent feelings of fatigue and frequent urination. Anne has been managing her conditions with lifestyle changes and medication (Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension). She is otherwise healthy and doesn't smoke or consume alcohol on a regular basis.   Diagnostic Evaluation:  Upon presentation  Anne's initial EKG readings showed ST-segment elevation  suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction  although her Troponin levels were within normal limits. Emergency coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries  ruling out acute coronary syndrome. To further assess the severity of the symptoms  a left ventriculogram was performed revealing apical ballooning with preserved function of the basal segments  a feature characteristic of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   Family History:  Interviews with Anne revealed that her father died from a myocardial infarction at 70 years old  while her mother had a stroke at 69  suggesting a familial predisposition to cardiovascular diseases. Neither of Anne’s parents had a known diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her 3 adult children are currently healthy with no reported cardiac concerns.  Treatment and Outcome:  Anne was treated conservatively with supportive care  including ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and anxiolytics  along with lifestyle modifications focusing on stress management. Anne’s symptoms significantly improved within days  and a follow-up echocardiogram 3 months later showed complete recovery of left ventricular function confirming a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   In the following months  Anne will continue with regular check-ups  and focus on improving her mental health  stress management  and maintaining her hypertension and diabetes. Familial screening  although not definitive in the context of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  might be considered in light of this diagnosis and her family history of cardiovascular diseases. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,58,Case Presentation:   Presenting Patient: Ms. D.R.  a 57-year-old African American female   Chief Complaint: Chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion   Past Medical History: Hypertension; no history of angina or myocardial infarction.   Family History: Father (deceased – myocardial infarction age 62); Mother (alive  has type II diabetes and hypertension); two older siblings with hypertension  one of whom had a myocardial infarction at age 65.   Background: Ms. D.R. is an administrative assistant who recently underwent tremendous amounts of stress in her personal life  with the sudden loss of her husband and job changes. Over the past week  she has been experiencing episodes of shortness of breath and chest pain that increases with exertion and moderate relief with rest.   Presentation: On arrival  blood pressure was elevated at 160/90 mmHg  pulse rate 101/min  respiratory rate 20/min  and Oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Initial blood workup showed elevated cardiac troponin levels. An ECG showed no ST-segment elevations or T wave inversions that would be highly suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. However  an echocardiogram demonstrated hypo kinesis of the mid-left ventricle  apical ballooning  features typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy without any obstructive coronary disease evident on coronary angiogram.  Diagnosis: Based on clinical and diagnostic findings  Ms. D.R. was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (stress-induced or broken heart syndrome)  a transient dysfunction of the left ventricle.  Treatment: Ms. D.R.'s hypertension needed to be controlled. She was initiated on beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and diuretics to manage her cardiomyopathy and hypertension. She was also referred to stress management counseling  given the probable relationship of her symptoms with her recent emotional stress overload.  Prognosis and Follow-up: Ms. D.R. seems to be stable and her symptoms improved after a week of treatment. She will continue her medications and scheduled for a follow-up consultation in a month. She was advised to seek immediate medical help should her symptoms worsen.  Conclusion: This case presentation reflects the typical demographics in the literature. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy chiefly affects postmenopausal women  and the course of the disease is generally good. It is often associated with a stressful event and can initially present like an acute bad heart  but on further examination  the symptom picture and investigations point towards Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Considerations for Future: Looking ahead  it would be advantageous to explore more in-depth the potential connections between emotional stress  racial disparities  and heart health outcomes in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,59,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 71-year-old Caucasian woman  known to be a divorcee  residing independently in San Diego  California. She has a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism  both managed well by medication for the past decade. Do not have any records of heart disease in her family. The patient is a non-smoker  reports moderate alcohol consumption and no illicit drug use. She's been managing stress related to the recent death of her beloved pet that created significant emotional distress.  Presenting Concern:  The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain that radiated to her left arm  with associated symptoms of nausea  lightheadedness  and profuse sweating. The onset of the symptoms was sudden and occurred approximately two hours prior to her presentation.  Clinical Findings:  The patient was markedly distressed upon examination  moderate hypertension was noted  and ECG showed ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads that could correlate to a myocardial infarction. However  her initial troponin levels were surprisingly low for the presumed extent of myocardial injury.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Upon considering the patient's signs and symptoms  an emergent coronary angiogram was performed  which ruled out any obstructive coronary artery disease. Upon carrying out a subsequent echocardiogram  the peculiar finding of apical ballooning with preserved function at the base of the heart was noted  leading to the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or Broken Heart Syndrome based on the Mayo clinic criteria for diagnosing this condition.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment:  The patient was managed conservatively with supportive therapy that included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics. A psychiatry evaluation was also done considering the recent stressful event  and a course of short-term anxiolytic medication has been advised.     Follow-up and Prognosis:  The prognosis for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is generally good with a complete recovery of heart function being seen in most such patients within weeks to months. Follow-up echo after 4 weeks showed marked improvement of the left ventricular function and eventually completely recovered eight weeks after the initial episode. The patient was then placed on routine follow-up care for her hypertension and hypothyroid condition but was also discussed stress management strategies to avoid similar recurrences.  Teaching Points:  This case highlights that though not very common  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain  especially those with a recent history of significant emotional stress. This becomes crucial when the presentation seems incongruous to the investigations in place.   Age  gender  and comorbidity should not deter the clinician from thinking along these lines as this condition can theoretically be seen in any profile. The key to diagnosis is a high degree of suspicion backed by appropriate diagnostics.   This case illustrates that the patient’s psychological state should not be overlooked when caring for somatic complaints. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,60,"Patient Information:  M. Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department after feeling chest pain and shortness of breath following an intense argument with a family member that took place two hours before arrival. The patient describes the pain as a heavy squeezing sensation  rated 8/10. The pain radiates to the left shoulder and is associated with a cold sweat. The patient has a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension and hypothyroidism. No history of cardiac diseases. Denies smoking  alcohol  or illicit drug use. Her mother died of myocardial infarction at the age of 72 years. Father died in his old age due to heart failure. No other relevant family history.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination showed tachycardia (105 bpm)  blood pressure 145/90 mmHg  a respiratory rate of 16 bpm  and oxygen saturation of 96%. Other findings within the normal range. Her ECG displayed ST-segment elevation in the anterior-lateral leads. Blood tests showed slightly elevated troponin level to 1.5 ng/mL (Normal range: < 0.04 ng/mL) and normal Creatine-Kinase level. There was a suspicion for acute coronary syndrome.  Treatment:  The patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin and chewable aspirin in the ER. She was admitted to the Cardiology unit and underwent an emergent coronary angiogram that showed completely normal coronary arteries. A subsequent left ventriculogram revealed apical ballooning with basal hypercontractility - a presentation consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  After diagnosis  the patient was put on Carvedilol to control heart rate and limit cardiac wall motion stress. Low-dose aspirin was also prescribed for preventative measures against thrombosis due to apical ballooning. ACE inhibitors were given for LV dysfunction.  Outcome and Follow-up:  Over the course of several days  the patient’s symptoms resolved. A follow-up echocardiogram performed seven days later showed definite improvement. An ECG and Echo done after a month showed normal heart function. The patient's stressors were addressed comprehensively with family psychotherapy and individual stress management. The patient was advised to make lifestyle modifications  approach methods to reduce stress  and is being regularly monitored for cardiac function.  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" often mimics acute coronary syndrome and is usually triggered by intense emotional or physiological stress. Despite her past medical history of hypertension and family history of heart disease  the patient's acute presentation after significant emotional distress  alongside the angiogram and ventriculogram findings  indicates a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Prompt treatment and comprehensive management were pivotal to this patient's recovery."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,61,Patient Presentation:  Our subject is a 72-year-old Caucasian female  Mrs. A  who has been diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM). She is widowed and retired. She has three children  and her family history indicated that her mother died of a heart attack at 76. It's noteworthy also that she has been under emotional stress due to the recent passing of one of her children.  Medical History:  She has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which she takes Lisinopril and Simvastatin. She is also diabetic and is being treated with metformin. She doesn't smoke but has a history of occasional alcohol consumption. She has no known drug allergies.  Patient's Encounter & Evaluation:  Mrs. A presented to the hospital with severe chest pain  which she described as a crushing sensation accompanied by shortness of breath and feeling faint. Initial vital signs were BP 155/95 mmHg  HR 98 bpm  RR 24 breaths/min  and temperature 98.6°F. EKG on admission showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads indicative of myocardial ischemia. Cardiac enzyme levels were slightly elevated.  Diagnostic Test and Evaluation:  An emergent coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease ruling out myocardial infarction. A subsequent echocardiogram showed apical ballooning with a reduced ejection fraction of 40%  leading to the presumptive diagnosis of TCM.  Management:  She was managed conservatively with a beta-blocker  ACE inhibitor  and aggressive heart failure regimen including diuretics as needed for fluid overload.  Outcome:  Over one-week hospital stay  her symptoms improved  and repeat echocardiogram showed recovery of the ventricular function with EF back to 60%. Mrs. A was discharged and referred to the outpatient heart failure clinic for follow-up.  Summary:  This case of Mrs. A reflects a typical demographic and background of a TCM patient. TCM  or Broken heart syndrome  is more common in postmenopausal women and often precipitated by severe physical or emotional stress. The presentation resembles acute coronary syndrome  yet coronary angiogram often reveals no obstructive coronary artery disease. Most patients  like Mrs. A  have a good prognosis although they require careful initial management due to the risk of severe heart failure and other complications. Regular monitoring and preventive therapy can offer good outcomes in such patients with TCM.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,62,Patient Profile: Name: Mrs. Sheila Cobb Age: 58 Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired School Teacher Background: Non-smoker; No Alcohol usage  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Cobb presented with severe chest pain and shortness of breath due to an intense emotional event  the sudden death of her spouse earlier in the week.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Cobb has a history of controlled hypertension for which she takes a daily low dose of amlodipine  type 2 diabetes being controlled through diet  and mild obesity (BMI 32). No past surgeries of relevance. There is no known drug allergy. She reports adherence to her antihypertensive medication and no recent changes in her overall health.  Family History: Her mother died at the age of 72 due to breast cancer. Her father lived until 80 and passed away from complications related to Alzheimer's disease. There's no known family history of cardiovascular diseases.   Examination Findings: On examination  her blood pressure was slightly elevated (160/95 mmHg)  HR was 105 BPM  and O2 Saturation was 92%. She appeared distressed due to the chest pain  and auscultation revealed no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. ECG showed ST-segment elevation  echocardiogram demonstrated apical ballooning  and there were no obstructions noted via coronary angiography but mild coronary atherosclerosis.   Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation  ECG  and echocardiographic findings  she was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome) - a condition commonly precipitated by severe emotional stress.  Management and Progress: She was initially managed with Aspirin  a high statin dose due to atherosclerosis on angiography  and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) for their proven efficacy in reducing morbidity in cardiovascular disease. To manage her emotional stress  she was referred to a psychologist. After a week of hospitalization  she showed significant improvement.   It is recommended that she be followed up with cardio and stress management programs  maintain her healthy diet  and continue with her prescribed medications for best possible outcomes. The response will be assessed during her follow-up appointment.  This case illustrates the classic presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often seen in postmenopausal women following an intense emotional event. It highlights the importance of considering this diagnosis in patients presenting with acute chest pain and ruling out the more common causes of these symptoms such as acute coronary syndrome.   Referral: Consideration for referral to an outpatient cardiology for follow-up to assess myocardial recovery and to a mental health specialist for grief-counseling is advised.   Patient Education: Patient was educated on the nature of the disease  its relation to stress  and the importance of practicing stress management and relaxation techniques as well as adhering to medication.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,63,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female with a previous history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. She was brought to the emergency department following an episode of intense chest pain  accompanied by shortness of breath and profuse sweating. She reported the symptoms were similar to a past angina pectoris attack which she had a year ago.   Past Medical History  She has a long-term history of hypertension managed conservatively with Lisinopril. Her hyperlipidemia is managed with Atorvastatin. The patient had previously been a heavy smoker for 30 years but quit ten years ago. About a year ago  the patient experienced an episode of angina for which diagnostic tests (including electrocardiogram and troponin levels) came back normal.   Social History  The patient is widowed and lives alone. She reports high levels of stress due to the recent death of her husband  exacerbated by lifestyle adjustments and financial concerns. She consumes alcohol sparingly and quit smoking ten years ago.  Family History  Family medical history includes cardiovascular disease in her late husband and her mother  who died from a heart attack in her early seventies. Her father had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and died at 68. She has two adult children who are alive and well.  Objective Examination and Tests  Upon admission  her blood pressure was 165/92 mmHg  heart rate was 110 bpm  irregular  and other vitals were within the normal range. She appeared pale and sweaty. Auscultation uncovered mild crackles in the lung bases. Initial laboratory work (including full blood count  renal function  liver function  and inflammatory markers) were within normal limits  while cardiac biomarkers (troponin T and creatinine kinase-MB) were raised. The EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  indicative of a possible anterior myocardial infarction.  However  coronary angiography ruled this out as it showed no significant coronary artery disease. Left ventriculography  performed subsequently  reported low ejection fraction (35%) and apical ballooning consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Since takotsubo cardiomyopathy is typically precipitated by an acute emotional or physical stressor  the recent death of the patient's husband might have played a significant role in her condition. The treatment plan was to manage her existing hypertension more aggressively and to explore the option of psychotherapy for stress management.   This case highlights the significant influence of acute emotional stressors as triggers for takotsubo cardiomyopathy  and the importance of holistic management covering not only the physiological aspects but also emotional well-being of the patient.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,64,Patient Details: Patient is Ms. Sharma  a 65-year-old Asian female. She is retired and lives alone  her two children live interstate. Ms. Sharma comes from a middle socio-economic status.   Past Medical History: Ms. Sharma has a medical history of hypertension which is currently managed with Ramipril. She has type 2 diabetes controlled by Metformin and diet. She also has diagnosed long-term anxiety  and is managed by Sertraline. She does not smoke  consumes alcohol socially and is not obese. She has no history of heart disease.   Presenting Complaint: Ms. Sharma presented with chest pain  shortness of breath  nausea  and diaphoresis. EKG findings suggested acute myocardial infarction. However  on admission  Echocardiogram showed normal coronary arteries with no blockages  left ventricular dysfunction  and apical ballooning typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken-heart-syndrome).  Family History: Deep in discussion  Ms. Sharma revealed her mother passed from congestive heart failure at the age of 78 and father from a stroke at the age of 72.   Other Relevant Information: Ms. Sharma revealed during consultation that she recently lost her husband to cancer three months ago and has been experiencing heightened emotional stress  anxiety  and depression since then. It's the trigger of this emotional turmoil.   Diagnosis: Based on the clinical findings and patient's history of recent severe emotional stress  a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made. This transient and reversible heart condition mimics symptoms of acute coronary syndrome and is often precipitated by acute emotional stress.   Plan: Ms. Sharma was admitted for supportive management including bed rest  and medications such as Beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. She was referred to a psychologist for help with her grief and anxiety. Regular monitoring of cardiac function via periodic echocardiograms was planned. Appointments for follow-up care and counseling were scheduled to provide emotional support.   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is often reversible  with most patients improving within weeks. However  patients like Ms. Sharma  with chronic emotional stressors  may experience a slower recovery. Multi-disciplinary management including psychological support is crucial in these cases.   The case of Ms. Sharma underscores the intricate relationship between physical and emotional health and the necessity of a holistic approach in managing atypical heart conditions like Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,65,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 66-year-old Asian post-menopausal female who presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to her back. Her background includes a history of hypertension and anxiety but has never before experienced any cardiologic issues. She lives alone and recently went through a stressful event - loss of a close family member. She denies any tobacco  alcohol  or illicit drug use. She has a family history of cardiovascular disease; her mother died at the age of 75 due to a myocardial infarction.   Clinical Findings:   On physical examination  the patient appeared acutely ill and was in distress. Her initial blood pressure was 180/95 mm Hg and pulse 110 beats per minute. The cardiac exam revealed no abnormal heart sounds. Laboratory tests indicated slightly increased troponin level  but the electrocardiogram (EKG) showed no signs of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).   Management and Outcome:   The patient was admitted for further testing  where a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed findings consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy - apical ballooning with preserved function of the basal segments.   The patient was treated with a combination of ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and anxiolytic medication. Over the week  the woman’s chest pain progressively improved and her blood pressure stabilized. A follow-up echocardiogram was performed one week later and showed improved function and resolution of apical ballooning.  Conclusion:  This patient’s presentation is consistent with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome."""" This is more common in post-menopausal women and can be triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. In this case  the patient's recent emotional trauma combined with her hypertension and history of anxiety may have contributed to her episode. The improvement in her symptoms and cardiac function with medical management supports this diagnosis. It is critical to recognize Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as an alternative diagnosis in patients presenting with acute chest pain  especially when there are triggering stress factors and the classic """"apical ballooning"""" is observed on echocardiography. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,66,Patient Presentation:   A 72-year-old African American woman visited our department complaining of a severe chest pain. The pain was intense  radiating to her neck  jaw  and down her left arm  accompanied by episodes of mild breathlessness. These symptoms culminated within a few hours after receiving the news of her husband’s sudden demise.  Past Medical History:  The patient's past medical history includes hypertension  diabetes mellitus type 2  and hyperlipidemia; all are well controlled on medication for the past 7 years. She is a non-smoker and denies any illicit drug or alcohol use. She has no known allergies. Her last cardiovascular workout was reported to be healthy ten months back.  Presenting Problem:  On physical examination  blood pressure is 165/95 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats/min  respiratory rate 20/min and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. A physical examination reveals no lower extremity edema  and initial laboratory tests display elevated troponin levels. The patient undergoes an ECG  which shows ST-segment elevations in anterior leads.  Hospital Course:  She was initially suspected of having an acute myocardial infarction. However  a subsequent coronary angiogram showed non-obstructive coronary artery disease. Echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular apical ballooning with the base of the heart contracting normally which is indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM). Her condition was managed with aspirin  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and statins. The patient responded well to the treatment and was stabilised. She was later proceeded for further cardiac management and psychological support.  Family History:  The patient's family history reveals her mother died from a stroke at 67 and her late husband was diabetic. Her two adult daughters are healthy. Her elder brother suffered from a heart attack in his early 70s.  Conclusion:  This is a classic case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly known as stress cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome ' which is usually precipitated by physical or emotional stress. There is a higher incidence rate among postmenopausal women and those with a history of neurologic or psychiatric diseases. The case further highlights the importance of incorporating a thorough medical history  appropriate differential diagnosis  and tailored individual therapies in the management of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It highlights the need for increased awareness and understanding of this condition  particularly among older women with existing cardiovascular risk factors experiencing acute stressors.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,67,Patient Information: Mr. Jackson  a 65-year-old African-American male  presented with symptoms of acute chest pain. He is a retired engineer  married  and lives with his wife. His BMI is 28  indicating overweight. He's not a smoker  but has a past history of mild hypertension and dyslipidemia. He has a family history of myocardial infarction with his father dying of a heart attack at the age of 71.   Presenting Concerns: Mr. Jackson was initially admitted to the emergency department (ED) with severe chest pain radiating down to the left arm  which started suddenly when he was gardening. The pain worsened with physical activity and eased upon resting. He also reported experiencing heavy sweating  feeling of impending doom and transient shortness of breath  all of which led to his visiting the ED.   Clinical Findings: On examination  he appeared anxious and pale. His blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg and heart rate was 90 beats per minute. Initial EKG revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads suggesting myocardial injury/infarction. Troponin I levels were modestly elevated with levels of 2.0 ng/mL (normal: 0.00-0.04 ng/mL).   Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: Immediately administered thrombolysis did not show any significant improvement. A subsequent echocardiogram  however  showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved function at the base  a classical feature seen in takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). Left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated at 45%. Coronary angiogram was normal excluding the possibility of acute coronary syndrome. There was no evidence of a pheochromocytoma or myocarditis from other lab tests.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment: Mr. Jackson was managed with supportive care including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and statins along with pain relief and reassurance.   Follow-up and Outcomes: After 48 hours  the patient's chest pain significantly reduced. He was discharged after a week  with his heart functioning back to normal as evidenced by follow-up echocardiography. He was advised to follow-up in clinic in one month and was prescribed medication for hypertension and dyslipidemia.  Teaching Points: - Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  mimics symptoms of a heart attack and is thought to be triggered by periods of severe emotional or physical stress. - TTC occurs more often in postmenopausal women. However  it can occur in men  particularly those with a history of neurologic or psychiatric disorders. - Majority of cases make a complete recovery with supportive management.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,68,"Patient Information:   A 65-year-old African American woman named Helen Washington presents to the emergency department. She is a retired school teacher who lives alone but maintains an independent lifestyle. She is a non-smoker and has occasional alcohol intake.   Presenting Problem:   Helen arrived complaining of severe chest pain that she rated as 9 out of 10 on the pain scale. She described the pain as sudden – like an """"elephant sitting on her chest"""" and accompanied by shortness of breath. The pain began while she was handling the sudden death news of her sister  which she found extremely stressful.  Past Medical History:   Helen has hypertension  controlled with medication  as well as a history of depression treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. She has no known history of coronary artery disease  diabetes  or other heart-related illnesses. She has no known drug allergies.   Family History:   Her family history is notable for hypertension in her mother and concerted heart failure in her father. Her sister  who recently passed away  was diagnosed with lung cancer. There’s no record of sudden cardiac death in the family.  Admission Diagnosis:  After performing an electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram  and based on her presentation and response to the sudden stressful event she recently faced  Helen was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". The cardiologist confirmed that her left ventricle ballooning confirmed this diagnosis.  Plan:  The cardiologist decided to manage her condition with conservative treatment. This included angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  Beta-blockers  and diuretics to manage her symptoms. The patient is also recommended to have a follow-up with a psychologist to help manage stress and prevent future TCM events.  This case illuminally notes the vital connection between psychological stress and heart health  and emphasizes the importance of managing stress levels in patients with a history of cardiac conditions.   Outcome:  Helen responded well to the treatment plan. Her chest pain resolved within a few days  and the medication was tolerated well. She set an appointment with a psychologist to help manage stress and was discharged home in stable condition. Follow-ups were scheduled.  This case presentation represents a fairly typical TCM patient as per the literature. TCM is more common in post-menopausal women and can be triggered by acute emotional stress  as was the case with our patient. It's key to remember that while TCM usually has a good prognosis  early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to prevent complications. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,69,Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old Asian female named Sora. She lives in a serene rural town outside Kyoto  Japan  and is a widow with two grown-up children. She has a body mass index of 23.1 and her significant past medical history involves hypertension for 10 years which is moderately controlled by medication.  Presenting Concerns: Sora was brought to the emergency room with acute chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations. She had been gardening when she felt an intense pain in her chest. Given her medical history  she suspected it may be serious and sought immediate help.  Medical History: Sora was diagnosed with hypertension a decade prior and has been on amlodipine 5mg daily since. She occasionally experiences mild headaches as a side effect. There is no history of Diabetes  Hyperlipidaemia  Coronary Artery Disease  or Stroke. Apart from hypertension  her medical history is fairly unremarkable. Sora is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially.  Family History: Sora's family history is significant with her father having suffered from a stroke at the age of 73 and her mother dying at 69 due to myocardial infarction. She has two elder brothers; one diagnosed with type II diabetes and the other having no significant ailments.  Clinical Findings: Upon reaching the hospital  Sora's symptoms still persisted. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation and echocardiogram revealed abnormal left ventricular motion  commonly known as 'apical ballooning'. However  her angiogram surprisingly did not report any significant blockages in the coronary arteries.  Diagnosis and Discussion: Given her symptoms  ECG  echocardiogram findings  and the absence of significant blockages on angiography  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy was made. This condition  often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress  is also called ‘broken heart syndrome’ and is more commonly seen in post-menopausal women. In Sora's case  it's vital to explore further if the emotional stress related to her widowhood might have contributed as psychological stressors often play a role in the onset of this condition. Her case strengthens the essential point to consider Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy as a plausible differential in older females presenting with ACS-like symptoms  even in instances where cardiac enzymes and coronary anatomy are inconclusive.   Treatment and Follow-Up: Sora was managed with β-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. She was advised to reduce her stress levels and was referred to a psychiatrist to help manage possible underlying emotional stressors. A follow-up appointment was scheduled in 1 month with a complete cardiology evaluation. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,70,Case Presentation:  Patient Identification: Ms. T  a 62-year-old Asian female with no prior history of cardiovascular diseases  presented to the emergency department reporting severe chest pain.  Present Illness: The patient reported recurrent episodes of chest pain  which started abruptly within the past five hours. The pain was intense at onset and radiated to her left shoulder and arms. She never experienced such pain before. Pain was associated with mild shortness of breath but no other associated symptoms like nausea  vomiting  or presyncopal symptoms were reported.  Past Medical History: The patient’s past history was significant for hypertension (on hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her diabetes well controlled with oral Metformin  and she had been following an overall healthy lifestyle. She reported compliance with her medications. No prior history of any cardiovascular diseases  surgeries  or hospitalizations were noted.   Social and Family History: She is a non-smoker and reported moderate alcohol consumption. The family history was negative for any heart diseases  stroke  or diabetes.   Review of Systems:  Unremarkable  apart from the above-noted chest pain.  Vital Signs & Physical Exam: Upon admission  the vital parameters revealed an elevated blood pressure of 170/95mm Hg  pulse rate: 110/min  respiratory rate: 20/min  temp: 98.6F  O2 sat: 95%. There were no abnormal findings in the physical examination.   Investigations: An electrocardiogram demonstrated ST-segment elevation suggesting myocardial injury. Despite this  her initial troponin levels were within normal limits. The patient also underwent Coronary Angiography which refuted the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease. The echocardiography revealed transient apical ballooning with reduced EF  which was suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Impressions & Plan: Ms. T was admitted to ICU under the presumptive diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy provided by the peculiar imaging findings in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease and identifiable stress triggers. She was managed with supportive treatments involving ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers and continuing her antihypertensive.   Identifying emotional stressors and taking appropriate action  such as psychological counseling  was planned. Furthermore  her risk factor for heart disease  Hypertension was to be suitably managed.  Conclusion: This case underscores the utility of comprehensive diagnostic work-up  including imaging and angiography  in reaching an accurate diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition often misdiagnosed as heart attack. The emotional and physical stress needs to be suitably addressed and managed in these patients.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,71,Case Presentation:  The patient is a 70-year-old Hispanic female  Mrs. H  living in an urban area with a positive family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). She is diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TC). Mrs. H is a retired nurse and is recently widowed. She presents herself with an anxiety disorder and has diabetes mellitus type 2 under control with oral pharmaceutical agents. She is a non-smoker  and moderates her alcohol consumption and has a BMI of 28.  Her current issue began approximately 2 weeks past  following a severe emotional stressor  with marked chest pain and palpitations. Prior to this  Mrs. H had enjoyed relatively unremarkable health.   Physical Examination: Blood pressure stood at 135/85 mmHg  pulse was 110 bpm and regular  respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute  and the O2 saturation level was 95% at room air. Despite a mild pallor  physical examinations yielded no unordinary findings.   On admission  Blood Testing presented elevated cardiac biomarkers such as Troponin  N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and Creatine Kinase MB (CK-MB)  corroborating a cardiac episode. ECG demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads.   A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed  revealing hypo-kinetic mid-segments with hyperdynamic apex  identifying the typical 'apical ballooning' - rendering the diagnosis of TC. The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated at 40%. However  a coronary angiography did not discover any significant coronary artery disease  discarding any chance of myocardial infarction.  A brief stress management consultation was conducted due to her anxiety disorder and the pronounced emotional trigger that seemed to have catalyzed the presentation of her symptoms. After a 3-day hospitalization and therapeutic management under close medical supervision  the patient demonstrated clinical signs of improvement.   Before discharge  she was instated with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins. Cardiovascular rehabilitation was recommended  and a follow-up appointment was scheduled for 2 weeks later. Thus  psychological support services were arranged for managing her anxiety and bereavement.  Mrs. H’s case emphasizes the critical role of psychological stressors as trigger-instances in the development of TC and hence the relevance of psychological support and stress management in these individuals.  Considering her advanced age and co-existence of type 2 diabetes mellitus  future care should consider these as significant factors of higher morbidity and a potential for further heart failure. Risk-reducing measures  such as a monitored diet  lifestyle adjustments  and regular exercise  should be advised to this end. Much emphasis is placed on regular follow-ups and monitoring the efficacy of her medications.   (Note: This case was formulated to be as authentic as possible  based on common presentations of TC. However  it does not reflect any specific patient or scenario and is intended for educational and illustrative purposes only.)   
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,72,Patient details: The patient  Mrs. Akiko Nakamura  is a 68-year-old Japanese woman  living in a suburb of Tokyo. She has been a widow for 15 years after her husband passed away from pancreatic cancer. She is a retired high school mathematics teacher and lives alone. She has two adult daughters who live and work in different provinces of Japan. Mrs. Nakamura doesn't smoke or drink alcohol. She likes to engage in brisk walking in her neighborhood for exercise.  Past medical history: Mrs. Nakamura has a history of hypertension  for which she takes medication regularly. She also has mild osteoarthritis and had been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for a brief period upon reaching menopause.  Family history: Her father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 73  and her mother had a stroke at age 70  but lived until 88. Her sibling  an older brother  is alive and has no significant health problems.  Presenting concern: Mrs. Nakamura was admitted to the emergency department of the local hospital following an episode of acute chest pain  mimicking a heart attack. She reported that this occurred shortly after she received news of a significant financial loss due to a scam – a stress-inducing event. She had no prior history of any heart disease. EKG revealed ST-segment elevation  typically seen in myocardial infarction  prompting further investigation.  Diagnosis: Though initially treated as an acute myocardial infarction  her echocardiogram and cardiac angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease but revealed apical ballooning – a characteristic feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular function was found to be temporarily impaired  and “takotsubo cardiomyopathy” or “broken heart syndrome” was diagnosed.  Management Strategy: Mrs. Nakamura was treated with medications including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors to manage her condition. The doctors also recommended a stress management intervention to help her cope with her recent financial loss and the emotional trauma associated with it.  Follow up and prognosis: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically has good prognosis  and Mrs. Nakamura's condition significantly improved over a period of few weeks with complete recovery of left ventricular function. She was asked to attend regular follow-ups every three months to monitor her condition.  This clinical scenario highlights the importance to explore beyond the apparent clinical presentation  especially in elderly women presenting with chest pain. High emotional stress is a major trigger factor for takotsubo cardiomyopathy  and this warrants the inclusion of stress management strategies as part of the holistic treatment approach.   Note: This case is consistent with demographic data that shows takotsubo predominantly affects post-menopausal women and can be triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. Factual data about Japanese population  lifestyle  and family dynamics was applied.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,73,Patient Description:  The patient is a 66-year-old Asian female  named Ms. Suzuki  who presented with symptoms of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. Her medical history includes well-controlled type 2 diabetes  mild hyperlipidemia  and a recent history of a high-stress life event as she recently lost her husband. She is a non-smoker and moderate alcohol consumer  with no known illicit drug history. Her family history is significant for a mother with coronary artery disease.  Presenting Symptoms and Clinical Findings:  Ms. Suzuki was rushed to the emergency room with severe chest pain described as a heavy pressure sensation  which radiates to her left arm. She also reported feeling short of breath. On physical examination  Ms. Suzuki appeared anxious and in pain. Heart sounds revealed tachycardia but no murmurs or gallops. Her blood pressure was 170/90 mmHg.   Diagnostic Evaluation:  An EKG initially demonstrated ST elevations indicative of a possible myocardial infarction. However  coronary angiography displayed no significant atherosclerotic disease. Surprisingly  left ventriculography presented a characteristic pattern of apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basal walls  suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM). Blood tests showed a moderate increase in cardiac enzymes.   Course of Treatment:  Ms. Suzuki was treated with aspirin  beta-blockers  and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Her chest pain and breathlessness gradually disappeared after a couple of days. Echocardiography performed at one month showed complete resolution of her ventricular dysfunction  confirming the diagnosis of TCM.  Brief Discussion:  TCM  also known as broken-heart syndrome  predominantly affects postmenopausal women and can mimic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. It is frequently triggered by severe emotional or physical stress  like the recent bereavement Ms. Suzuki experienced. Despite an initial presentation resembling a heart attack  TCM does not involve a blockage of the coronary arteries. Treatment is typically supportive  and most people recover completely.  In conclusion  TCM is a critical differential diagnosis in older women presenting with what seems like acute coronary syndrome  especially in the context of recent severe stress. Early recognition and appropriate management usually lead to a full recovery  as in the case of Ms. Suzuki.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,74,"Patient Profile: Initials: M.A. Gender: Female Age: 65 Race: Asian (Japanese) Occupation: Retired teacher  Presenting Details: Ms. M.A.  a 65-year-old retired teacher  presented to cardiology with a sudden onset of chest pain and dyspnea that started a few hours ago. The chest pain was severe  lasted several minutes  and was associated with shortness of breath. At the time she was alone at home. Given the sudden onset and severity of the symptoms  she called emergency services who classified the situation as potential acute coronary syndrome and transported her to the nearest medical facility.  Past Medical History: Ms. M.A. has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are adequately controlled with medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin). She used to smoke half a pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years but quitted 10 years ago. There is no known heart disease  diabetes  or stroke history  nor any other significant illnesses.   Demographics and Social Information: Ms. M.A. is of Japanese descent  based on the literature  a higher prevalence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been observed among Asian women  particularly postmenopausal ones. She is widowed and lives alone. She has two children who live nearby  and she is active in her local community. She is not known to drink alcohol.   Family History: She has a family history of cardiovascular diseases; her father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 57  and her mother had a stroke at the age of 66. None of her siblings or children have been diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases. There is no known congenital heart disease in the family.  Clinical Assessment: On initial clinical assessment  she had significant ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG). This warranted further investigation including cardiac enzymes which were also found to be elevated. The rapid diagnosis pathway led to an urgent coronary angiogram  which surprisingly showed no apparent coronary artery disease. Left ventriculography revealed left ventricular apical ballooning  compatible with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" is a reversible acute heart failure syndrome that mimics acute coronary syndrome. It is predominantly found in postmenopausal women and can be triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. The pathophysiology behind takotsubo cardiomyopathy still remains unclear.  Management: Ms. M.A was provided with conservative management  supportive therapy with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. She had a good recovery and follow-up echocardiography showed improvement in her cardiac function.  Outcome: This case underscores the importance of understanding the clinical presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in post-menopausal women. The patient was discharged with adequate educational material about her condition and stress management strategies.  References: Khouzam  R.A.  Mirocha  J.  Tobis  J.  & Kathrotiya  P. (2019).

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,75,"Patient Profile:  Ms. Kaori  a 58-year-old Asian woman  presented to the emergency department with an onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. As a single  retired school teacher  she lives alone and prefers a calm and quiet lifestyle. According to her past medical history  she doesn't drink or smoke but has endured an extensive history of migraines. She later revealed she was under severe emotional stress due to the sudden death of her sister two weeks prior.   Clinical Investigation:  Upon performing an electrocardiogram (ECG)  it was observed that the patient had some ST-segment elevations  usually associated with a myocardial infarction. Her lab tests revealed mildly elevated levels of cardiac troponin  a marker of heart injury. Additionally  her creatine kinase-MB levels were also elevated. However  the results were inconsistent with the typical patterns seen in a conventional heart attack. While her cholesterol levels slightly exceeded the normal range  her blood pressure was largely on the higher side.  Due to the ECG results and her symptoms  the patient underwent an emergency coronary angiogram  expected to show blockages in the coronary arteries. Surprisingly  the angiogram showed no significant obstructions. An echocardiogram was also conducted  which showcased a peculiar feature of an abnormal left ventricular contraction pattern.   Diagnosis:  Based on the characteristic signs and absence of significant coronary artery disease  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". This condition tends to affect postmenopausal women and is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress  leading to severe and reversible left ventricular dysfunction.  Family History:  Upon further investigation  Ms. Kaori revealed that her mother was diagnosed with heart disease at the age of 70 and passed away due to heart failure two years later. However  there wasn't any record of TCM in her immediate family history.  Management and Follow up:  The patient was managed with supportive treatment  including beta-blockers to control high blood pressure and medications to alleviate her chest pain. She was also advised to attend regular therapy sessions to address her emotional stress and grief.   After one month of treatment and several sessions of therapy  her symptoms markedly improved. Follow-up echocardiography performed three months later revealed a return of normal left ventricular function. She is now committed to regular follow-ups.  This case presents an example of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  an important differential diagnosis in women presenting with acute chest pain and temporary heart dysfunction.  References:  1. Templin  C.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,76,Patient Profile: Name: Anonymous Age: 68 Gender: Female Race: White  Occupation: Retired Teacher Previous Medical History: Hypertension  Anxiety  The patient  a 68-year-old Caucasian woman  presented in the emergency room with sudden onset chest pain  and shortness of breath. She reported experiencing an intense emotional incident which resulted in high levels of anxiety  prompting the acute symptoms. She has a known history of hypertension treated with Lisinopril 10mg daily  and she has been managing her anxiety disorder with the help of a psychiatrist.   She has been a non-smoker throughout her life and maintains moderate alcohol consumption. Her family history includes a father who passed away due to myocardial infarction at age 60 and a mother with history of breast cancer. She has two adult sons who are in good health with no known cardiac or mental disorders.  Investigations: Upon arrival  initial EKG showed minimal ST-elevation  echocardiography showed left ventricular apical ballooning with a conserved basal function suggestive of Takotsubo (or stress) cardiomyopathy. The troponin level was mildly elevated. While coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease  which is typical for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  As per medical literature  this case aligns with demographic trends of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as it is most often found in post-menopausal women and can be triggered by intense emotional or physiological stress.  Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome)  a transient heart condition typically precipitated by severe emotional distress.  Management and Follow-Up: The patient was stabilized with conservative management following guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome. The standard protocol for heart failure was initiated  including ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics as needed. Her psychiatrist was informed to coordinate for management of her anxiety disorder in the context of the cardiomyopathy. She was discharged after a week with marked improvement in her left ventricular function shown in a repeat echocardiogram before discharge and was advised to follow up in cardiology and psychiatry clinics.  Education was also provided regarding the nature of the condition  the symptoms  triggers  and the importance of managing emotional stress. Also  lifestyle modifications  like a healthy diet and regular exercise  were advised. Long term  the prognosis for takotsubo cardiomyopathy is favorable  provided triggers such as significant emotional stress can be avoided or appropriately managed.  This brief presentation reflects the clinical scenario that is usually associated with older postmenopausal women who are more frequently susceptible to takotsubo cardiomyopathy often following severe emotional distress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,77,"Patient Profile: The patient  Ms. A  is a 63-year-old African-American woman hailing from a lower-middle-income background. She is a retired school teacher and currently resides with her daughter's family in suburban Alabama. Ms. A is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She is divorced and has experienced significant psychosocial stressors in her life  including a car accident that left her with limited mobility  and the recent death of her older brother.  Past Medical History: Ms. A has a history of borderline hypertension which she manages with diet and exercise  instead of medication  due to her fear of side effects. She does not have a history of coronary heart disease  diabetes  or stroke. Furthermore  she denies having unusual symptoms like syncope  palpitations  or angina prior to this event.  Family History: There is a family history of cardiovascular disease; her mother died of congestive heart failure at the age of 71 and her brother passed away from a heart attack at 65. There is no known history of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the family.  Presenting Complaint: Ms. A was brought to the ER by her daughter  complaining of severe chest pain and difficulty breathing that started shortly after she received news of her brother's sudden death. No other symptoms like gastroenteritis  viral symptoms  or other systemic symptoms were reported.  Examination and Investigation: On examination  her blood pressure was slightly high  pulse regular but mildly rapid  and other vitals were stable. Physical examination did not yield any other significant results. The EKG initially showed ST-segment elevation  later confirming no occlusive coronary disease by doing coronary angiogram. Her cardiac enzymes were elevated on admission but returned to normal after 2 days. An echocardiogram showed apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basal walls  typical of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis and Management: Based upon her symptoms and the characteristic findings on the echocardiogram  Ms. A was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken-heart syndrome"""". She was managed conservatively with aspirin  beta-blockers  and ACE inhibitors  along with psychological counseling to help her cope with the current stressors in her life.  Present Status: In the subsequent 48 hours  her chest pain and breathlessness reduced significantly  and she was discharged 4 days after admission. Ms. A has been advised to follow up in the outpatient department after two weeks for a review of her treatment regimen. Additionally  a reference was made to a local support group and therapy sessions to aid in stress management.   Conclusion: This case underscores the role of acute emotional stress in the etiology of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the necessity of psychological support in managing such cases. Further studies are necessary to explore the epidemiology and possible genetic predisposition of this condition among populations like African-American women in their post-menopausal age."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,78,Case Presentation:  Patient Details:  Ms. Jones is a 67-year-old Caucasian female who presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain. Ms. Jones describes the pain as a “crushing sensation” that radiates to her left shoulder and arm  persisting for the past hour. She denies associated symptoms like shortness of breath  nausea  or diaphoresis. Ms. Jones  a recent widow  lost her husband a month ago and has been under a lot of emotional stress dealing with this loss.   Medical History:  The patient has a prior history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  with and has elected not to use medications for these conditions due to personal beliefs. She also has a history of post-menopausal Syndrome and is non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol. There are no noted allergies  and she has not undergone any surgeries or medical interventions in the past.  Family History:  Her father died at 72 and mother at 75  both with a history of coronary artery disease. She has no siblings. Her two children are in good health.  Examination:  On physical examination  the patient is anxious  in distress  complaining of persistent chest pain. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg  pulse 110 bpm  and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Cardiac auscultation reveals no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. There are no clinical signs of heart failure  and rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  Investigations:  An ECG is performed  showing slight ST-segment elevation  and troponin levels are marginally elevated. Given her symptoms as well as these results  she was initially managed for suspected acute coronary syndrome. Despite this  her coronary angiography was normal  so an echocardiogram was performed  showing apical ballooning of the left ventricle with impaired ejection fraction  but the normal base function - features strongly suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Treatment Course:  Given Ms. Jones' clinical scenario  emotional stress  features of acute coronary syndrome  and echocardiogram results  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made. She was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-blocker in acute hospital stay. Her chest pain resolved over the following days  and repeat echocardiogram prior to discharge showed near normalisation of her left ventricular function. She was also referred to the psychiatry team for management of stress and possible grief reaction after her husband's death.  Prognosis:  Ms. Jones responded well to the treatment and psychological support to manage her stress. Her prognosis is generally good as most patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy experience complete recovery within weeks. However  she was educated about possible recurrence  especially in stressful situations  and advised to take medications consistently and follow up regularly.  This case emphasizes the unique association between severe emotional stress and takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition more common in post-menopausal women and often mimicking acute coronary syndrome.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,79,"Patient Profile  Name: Mrs. J  a 68-year-old female of Caucasian descent.   Past Medical History: Mrs. J has a history of well-controlled hypertension  depression  and generalized anxiety disorder. She has been on Amlodipine (5mg/day)  Sertraline (100mg/day)  and Lorazepam (1mg as needed) for the past ten years. Besides these  she did not have any other significant medical history or surgeries and has never been a smoker or alcohol consumer.   Family History: Obtaining family history revealed that her father had a myocardial infarction at 75 years  and her mother had hypertension. She has a younger brother who has type 2 diabetes.   Presenting Complaint: Mrs. J presented to the Emergency Department with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. An hour before her presentation  she admitted to receiving devastating news concerning the sudden death of her favorite grandson. She described the pain as having a severity of 8/10 and similar to a heavy weight pressing on her chest.   Clinical Assessment: Initial vital signs were Blood Pressure 156/95 mmHg  Pulse rate 110 per minute  Respiratory rate 22 per minute  Temperature 98.2 Fahrenheit  oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed an anxious woman in distress  with cold sweats. Heart sounds were tachycardic with no added sounds; lung sounds were clear. Lab tests showed moderately raised Troponin levels.   Investigation & Diagnosis: The ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. An echocardiogram revealed a severely reduced ejection fraction with apical ballooning  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"Broken Heart"""" syndrome. Coronary angiography was done and showed no significant atherosclerotic lesions to explain the wall motion abnormality as seen in the echo.   Management & Outcome: Mrs. J was admitted to the Cardiology Unit and was managed in line with the standard protocol for takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This included discontinuation of her Amlodipine  instead started on carvedilol  and maintaining her at a low-stress environment. Her chest pain gradually resolved over the next few days  and she was discharged with plans to follow up in a cardiac rehabilitation clinic. The importance of psychological support to handle the grief and increase her resistance to stress was reinforced.  This case highlights the importance of recognizing takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome that is predominantly observed in post-menopausal women under intense emotional stress. Physical and emotional stress management strategies  along with appropriate pharmaceutical manipulation  can lead to a promising outcome.   Disclaimer: The demographic representation in this case is based on typical presentations as found in the medical literature. It is not a stereotype – takotsubo cardiomyopathy can potentially affect anyone regardless of age  sex  or race."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,80,"Patient Presentation  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian woman  Mrs. Jane  who resides in the suburb of an urban area. She is a retired teacher  widowed with two children living out of state. She was admitted to the emergency department experiencing a sudden onset of severe chest pain  accompanied by shortness of breath. The patient described the pain as similar to """"a heavy weight on my chest"""". She does not smoke  maintains a moderate alcohol intake  and leads a sedentary lifestyle.  Past Medical History  Mrs. Jane is noted to have a history of hypertension  controlled with medications  and no known history of cardiac diseases. She has been on treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years. She also has a documented history of arthritis and she received NSAIDS for it. She has not had any allergies to medications and no surgeries in the past.  Family History  Her mother died of a stroke at the age of 82 and her father had died from complications pertaining to lung cancer at 76 years age. She has a younger brother who was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's recently. Apart from these  she has no family history of cardiac diseases.  Presenting Complaints  The physician ordered an EKG after her arrival  which displayed ST-segment elevations suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction. Immediate cardiac angiogram and left ventriculography revealed a typical picture of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  with akinesis of the apical and mid segments of the left ventricle  and a hyperactive basal segment.  Potential Triggers  Prior to the onset of chest pain  Mrs. Jane described being under significant emotional stress  as she was the primary caretaker for her brother with Alzheimer's. The death of a close friend  a week prior  had heightened this stress.   Discussion  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'  typically presents with chest pain and EKG changes similar to a heart attack  triggered by severe emotional stress. As seen in this case  post-menopausal women are particularly prone to TCM. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out coronary artery disease  coronary angiography is necessary  which is supported by the findings seen in Mrs. Jane's investigations.  Plan of Treatment  Mrs. Jane was started on beta-blockers  ace inhibitors  and was encouraged to start psychotherapy for stress management. It was planned to monitor her symptoms and heart function closely with follow-up appointments. Education was given on the need for regular exercise  a heart-healthy diet and to maintain her blood glucose and blood pressure under control to prevent further complications.   The patient tolerated the treatment well and was discharged in a stable condition with planned outpatient follow-up and supportive therapies to help cope with the stress.  This case underscores the importance of considering a wide differential when presented with acute chest pain  including less common diagnoses such as Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,81,Patient Case Presentation:   Patient Information: A 57-year-old Asian woman  Mrs. Chan  presents herself to the outpatient clinic. She's married and works as a primary school teacher. She has a normal BMI and leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Chan has a past history of hypertension and type-2 diabetes  both controlled with medication. She also suffers from panic disorder and undergoes regular psychotherapy. Mrs. Chan does not smoke or consume alcohol and has no known drug allergies.  Family History:  Her father died at 63 due to myocardial infarction  and her mother is alive at 80 with no known cardiac ailments. Mrs. Chan has two siblings  both in good health.  Presenting Problem: Mrs. Chan presents with chest discomfort  resembling angina  that started amidst a stressful parent-teacher conference a day prior. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath  palpitations  fatigue  light-headedness  and minor episodes of syncope post the stressful event.  Clinical Findings: On examination  Mrs. Chan's blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  and her heart rate was 95 beats per minute. A 12-lead ECG revealed ST-segment elevation suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. Her Troponin I levels were elevated 4.8ng/mL (Normal Range:0-0.04 ng/mL). An echo and angiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with normal coronary arteries indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Treatment and Follow-Up: Mrs. Chan was admitted to the hospital  where individuals could observe her closely. She was started on aspirin  a beta-blocker  and an ACE inhibitor for cardiac management. She also underwent counseling to handle stress better  considering her existing panic disorder.  Conclusion: No definitive treatment for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been established yet as it often resolves spontaneously. However  managing her stress levels is crucial considering the significant role of emotional triggers in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Doctors will keep monitoring Mrs. Chan's overall cardiac health  considering her history and familial predisposition  and adjust medications as necessary. Regular follow-ups have been advised for closely monitoring her condition and prevent recurrence.   As seen in literature  people affected by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy are predominantly postmenopausal women with Asian descent individuals carrying a slightly elevated risk. Stress can play a significant role in the onset of the condition  and those with a history of psychiatric disorders like Mrs. Chan seem to be at higher risk as well.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,82,"Patient Presentation:  The patient  Ms. Cabrera  is a 68-year-old Hispanic female from the United States. She is a retired teacher living on her own but regularly visited by family members. Her past medical history comprises hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She was on antihypertensive and oral hypoglycemic drugs. Her BMI is 27. She has a family history of coronary artery disease and stroke. She quit smoking 15 years ago and drinks alcohol socially. She has no known allergies.  Presenting Symptoms:  Ms. Cabrera was brought into the ER after experiencing severe chest pain similar to angina with accompanying shortness of breath. This occurred suddenly after hearing her sister had passed away  causing her severe emotional distress. Physical examination revealed she was tachycardic  diaphoretic  and moderately distressed by her symptoms.  Investigations:  Her ECG initially showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  mimicking the changes seen in acute anterior wall MI. Serum troponin was six times the normal higher limit. However  coronary angiography showed no obstructive coronary artery disease. An echocardiogram showed reduced ejection fraction (45%) with a unique contraction pattern. The base of the ventricle contracted normally  but the mid-ventricular segments and apex were hypokinetic  giving the left ventricle a shape resembling a """"takotsubo """" a Japanese octopus trap.  Diagnosis:   Ms. Cabrera was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken-heart syndrome.""""   Management and Follow-Up:  She was managed conservatively with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and supportive care. After twelve weeks  a follow-up echocardiogram showed a normalized ejection fraction and recovered left ventricle function. Lifestyle modifications  including stress management counseling  were advised.  This case highlights the need to recognize and manage this unique type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy  which can mimic an acute myocardial infarction and is set off by extreme emotional or physical stress. Early recognition and appropriate management can result in complete recovery.  (Note: It is important to mention that the patient is fictive  just as part of a study  scientific material  or academic exercise.)"
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,83,"Case Presentation:   Demographics: 70-year-old Asian female   Presenting symptoms: Severe chest pain  shortness of breath   Past Medical History: History of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus managed on medications; no prior heart disease.   Family History: Mother and maternal grandmother had died of heart failure in their late 70s.  Social History: Retired school teacher  lives alone but has a supportive network of children and grandchildren. Non-smoker  occasional alcohol user.   Clinical Scenario: The patient was brought to the hospital's emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain with shortness of breath. It started following a heated argument with a neighbor which had resulted in significant distress.   Physical Examination: On examination  was in obvious distress  sweaty with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure was 180/100 mm Hg. Cardiac auscultation revealed no abnormal sounds.   Investigations: Initial EKG showed ST-segment elevation suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). However  the patient's serum troponin level was unexpectedly low. Upon cardiac catheterization  no significant stenosis in any of her coronary arteries was found  ruling out typical myocardial infarction.   The echocardiogram showed a reduced ejection fraction with the classic """"takotsubo"""" or """"apical ballooning"""" sign - a pattern of heart muscle movement seen almost exclusively in takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It suggested that the patient's heart was not effectively pumping blood to the rest of her body.  Diagnosis: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) – a condition often triggered by severe stress that has symptoms similar to a heart attack.  Management: The patient was given beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors to help her heart function more efficiently and to alleviate her symptoms. Her blood pressure and diabetes control were optimized. She was counselled on stress management techniques to help prevent future episodes.  Progosis: One month follow-up indicated that the patient’s ejection fraction had returned to normal  suggesting her heart had fully recovered. Aspects of psychological well-being were addressed as part of her ongoing care.  Summary: This case presentation demonstrated takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a 70-year old Asian female with a history of hypertension and diabetes. The condition  often triggered by severe emotional stress  presents similarly to myocardial infarction but has distinct findings on cardiac imaging and can typically be managed to full recovery with appropriate medical care."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,84,Patient Presentation  Our patient of interest is a 67-year-old African American woman named Mary who lives alone. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia; both are controlled through medication. She has no recorded history of either cardiovascular diseases or previous heart-related problems. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. Her mother had hypertension  and her father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. There is no family history of any form of cancer. Currently  she is not in any physically demanding job; she retired 5 years ago from the Civil Service.   Chief Complaint and Symptoms  Her principal complaint was difficulty in breathing  which she noticed two days prior to consultation but brushed it aside as a symptom of stress. Additionally  she had been experiencing intermittent chest pain that worsened during physical exertion or excitement. The patient also reported fatigue over the past few days. She decided to consult when the chest pain became more persistent and the difficulty breathing increased.  Clinical Findings  Physical examination revealed tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and slightly elevated blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg. There were no distinctive heart murmurs noted  and the lung sounds were clear bilaterally. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests were significant for a slightly elevated troponin of 0.2 ng/mL (Normal: <0.1 ng/mL)  and an EKG revealed ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads.  Hospital Course and Management  She was initially managed as a case of evolving myocardial infarction. She was admitted to the hospital  put on nitroglycerin  and prepared for a coronary arteriogram. Surprisingly  the coronary arteriogram failed to reveal significant obstruction to justify the ST elevations and increased troponin level. An echocardiogram was done and showed apical ballooning with a preserved base  a characteristic feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome.   She was started on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors  in addition to continued monitoring and supportive therapy. Over the course of five days  her chest pain and shortness of breath significantly improved. Follow-up echocardiogram showed a significant improvement in the heart motion abnormality  and she was then discharged.  Outcome and Follow-up  She is presently in a follow-up clinic and has been asymptomatic since her discharge. The patient was educated on stress management and necessary lifestyle modifications as this condition often follows acute emotional or physiological stress. The patient has shown great improvement and the disease has not recurred.  Conclusion  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  although a rare and poorly understood condition  should be considered as a possible diagnosis in patients  especially post-menopausal women  presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Adequate recognition of this syndrome can lead to suitable treatment strategies and hence prevent serious complications.   In this case  the patient's chest pain and breathing difficulty  linked with her age  gender  stress levels  and absence of significant coronary artery disease  led to the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Appropriate management led to the resolution of her symptoms and overall clinical improvement.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,85,Subject: 68-year-old Asian female with takotsubo cardiomyopathy   Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 68-year-old Asian woman who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of severe chest pain and shortness of breath starting around 3 hours prior to arrival. The pain was described as a tightening sensation in her chest  non-radiating  and 8/10 in intensity. She also reported feeling nauseous  but denied any vomiting or episodes of fainting. The patient stated that her symptoms began suddenly while she was at her daughter's wedding  a highly emotional event for her.   Past Medical History:   The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are well-controlled on medication. She underwent a hysterectomy 20 years ago. She has a 25-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. The patient does not consume alcohol or use illicit drugs. She is up-to-date with her routine check-ups and vaccinations. Her medications include Metformin and Lisinopril.   Family History:  Her father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65  and her mother had stroke at the age of 70. A sibling was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is no known family history of other genetic syndromes or cancers.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient appeared distressed but was oriented to time  place  and person. Her blood pressure was 170/105 mmHg  pulse was regular at 100 beats per minute  respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Auscultation revealed normal heart sounds and slightly labored respirations but no wheezing.   Investigations and Diagnosis:   ECG showed ST-segment elevation in precordial leads  suggesting an acute coronary syndrome. However  laboratory testing showed normal troponin levels. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved function at the base  indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The diagnosis was supported by a coronary angiography  which showed no significant coronary artery disease.  Treatment and Outcome:   The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on supportive treatments  including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. The patient's symptoms gradually improved  and she was discharged home. On a follow-up visit 1 month later  an echocardiogram showed complete resolution of the ventricular dysfunction  confirming the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Discussion:  With takotsubo cardiomyopathy being more common in postmenopausal women  often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress  this patient's presentation was classic. It is essential to differentiate takotsubo from acute coronary syndrome due to differences in management. Long-term management includes control of risk factors and addressing potential triggering stressors.   Note: This case is not based on a real patient  but modeled after typical presentations reported in literature. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,86,History Presentation:  Patient: Ms. Zhao  a 72-year-old female Asian  from Beijing  China  retired middle school teacher.  Presenting problem: She was brought to the ER following an episode of severe chest pain and difficulty in breathing  which developed after she received news of her son's car accident.  Past medical history: The patient has a 10-year history of hypertension  which was well-managed by her primary care doctor with amlodipine. She never smoked or used illicit drugs and drinks no more than two glasses of wine per week.   Family history: Non-contributory. There are no reported cases of heart disease  hypertension  diabetes mellitus  or similar conditions in her close relatives.  Review of systems: The patient noticed fatigue  palpitations  and occasional lightheadedness in the past week. However  she attributed these symptoms to her anxiety and did not seek medical attention.  Physical examination: Her vital signs are within normal range  but with slightly increased blood pressure (145/90 mmHg). Cardiac examination revealed regular rhythm with no murmurs. Lung sounds were clear. Legs showed no sign of edema. Her chest radiograph disclosed no significant abnormalities  EKG showed ST-segment elevation  however  her troponin levels were only slightly raised.  Treatment: Given the generic presentation of her symptoms mimicking Acute Coronary Syndrome  she was initially managed for the same. However  a subsequent angiogram showed no significant blockages  but the left ventricle had a classic ballooning shape indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The cause was diagnosed as emotional stress related after receiving the news about her son’s accident. Her treatment was aimed at managing symptoms and potential complications.   Discussion: This case is interesting because takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as “broken-heart syndrome”  is often triggered by severe stress and has symptoms similar to a heart attack. While seen generally in postmenopausal women  it is still an uncommon condition. It is most commonly associated with the female gender and Asian descent  which ties in with Ms. Zhao's demographic data. This case represents the typical demographic and trigger situation frequently found in literature. The prognosis of this condition is usually favorable  with most people recovering with appropriate medical management. This case highlights the importance of a comprehensive and accurate assessment of clinical symptomatic presentation in diagnosis. Ms. Zhao is currently in the in-patient ward and her symptoms have greatly improved with beta blockers and ace inhibitors. She will require continuous monitoring.   This brief case underlines the importance of understanding takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in patients  especially in elderly Asian women presenting with heart attack-like symptoms following a severe emotional stress event.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,87,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. Maria Alvarez  a 52-year-old Hispanic/Latino female  presents at the Emergency Department with severe chest pain radiating towards the left arm. She reports she's been under significant stress and experiencing episodes of sadness following her divorce finalized two weeks ago.   Past Medical History:   Ms. Alvarez has a known history of Type 2 diabetes and hypothyroidism. She has a BMI of 27 and has been smoking half-a-pack tobacco per day for the past 15 years. Prior medical encounters include yearly physical examinations with minor abnormalities such as elevated blood sugar levels and high cholesterol. Over the last six months  she has not shown up for her regular follow-ups due to her ongoing divorce proceedings.   Family History:  Ms. Alvarez's mother had a myocardial infarction at age 62  and her sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 46. There is also a family history of diabetes.  Presenting Symptoms:  Patient is conscious and oriented but appears anxious and stressed. She describes the pain as similar to a """"heart attack"""" she has seen in movies. She looks physically exhausted  indicating a lack of sleep over the past couple of weeks.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  An electrocardiogram (ECG) gives an initial diagnosis of either an acute myocardial infarction or takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to the presence of ST-segment elevations. On the transthoracic echocardiogram  her left ventricle displayed an abnormal shape (apical ballooning)  which is more likely in takotsubo cardiomyopathy than a traditional heart attack. Coronary angiogram does not show any blockages aligning her condition with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment:  Ms. Alvarez is admitted to the ICU and initiated on heart failure protocol consisting of beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. She also received in-hospital psychotherapy to manage her emotional stress.  Conclusion:  Ms. Alvarez’s case is a classical example of 'takotsubo cardiomyopathy'  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'. This under-recognized and often mistaken for the traditional heart attack condition primarily affects postmenopausal women and is often preceded by acute emotional or physical stress. Further management includes stress management therapies  follow-up appointment schedule  and strict control of her diabetes and hypothyroidism. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,88,Patient Presentation   Name: Ms. Jane Wilson Age: 65 years old  Gender: Female  Ethnic Background: Caucasian  Occupation: Recently retired school principal Location: Living in downtown Toronto  Canada   Medical History  Ms. Wilson has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She was diagnosed with her blood pressure and blood sugar issues five years ago after a routine medical checkup revealed abnormally high levels for both. She has since been on antihypertensive drugs as well as oral hypoglycemic agents to manage her conditions. Her compliance with medications has been good and they are fairly well controlled.  Family History  There is a history of cardiovascular diseases within her family; her father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and her elder sister currently has heart failure.  Presenting Complaint  Ms. Wilson presented at the hospital with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  which was initially suspected as a heart attack. However  upon further cardiac examinations  normal coronary arteries were found without signs of significant blockage  therefore ruling out a traditional heart attack.  Diagnosis  The cardiologist conducted an echocardiogram  which showed distinctive wall motion abnormalities typically seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a temporary heart condition which mimics a heart attack and is often brought on by stressful situations. In Ms. Wilson's case  she mentioned dealing with a divorce and the death of her mother abroad whom she couldn't visit due to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.  Management  Ms. Wilson was managed with heart failure medications including ACE inhibitors  Beta blockers  and diuretics. She was also advised to incorporate stress management techniques such as yoga and mindfulness practices into her lifestyle.  Prognosis Considering her age and the management of her condition  she has a favorable prognosis given adherence to the medical treatment and lifestyle modifications. Psychotherapy sessions were also recommended due to the strong link between emotional or physical stress and the occurrence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Discussion Takotsubo cardiomyopathy predominantly affects postmenopausal women and is often preceded by emotional or physical stressors. The mortality and morbidity are similar to or slightly lower than that of primary acute coronary syndromes  but the prognosis is generally good with appropriate treatment and stress management. A history of psychiatric illness has also been identified as a risk factor and psychological intervention often aids in symptom management. thus Ms. Wilson's case is quite representative of literature descriptions.   Follow Up  Ms. Wilson will be followed up regularly at the clinic to monitor her response to therapy and ease of coping with life stressors. Regular echocardiograms are planned to assess the recovery of her heart function.    References: (Insert appropriate references here)

She is a retired high school teacher and lives alone. Her BMI presents in a healthy range. Mrs. Lee does not smoke  and alcohol consumption is minimal- about a glass of wine once every two weeks. Her only known allergy is to shellfish.   Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 7 years ago. However  the condition is well-managed with diet  regular exercise  and medication (metformin). She also has a history of Panic Disorder and has been receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy and medication (Sertraline). She has had no previous hospitalizations until now.  Family History: Mrs. Lee’s family history includes her mother who died from a stroke at 85  and her father who suffered from Prostate Cancer but died at the age of 88 due to old age. She has one sibling- a younger sister- with a history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension who is currently 65 years old.  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Lee presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  resembling acute myocardial infarction  following an acute emotional stress of losing her lifelong best friend.   Clinical Assessment: On examination  Mrs. Lee appears anxious and is experiencing visible distress due to the chest pain. Her blood pressure is elevated (165/90 mmHg) and ECG shows ST-segment elevation. Cardiac enzyme levels were slightly elevated  but her heart anatomy was normal on the chest X-ray  indicating no signs of blockages in coronary arteries  which is atypical for myocardial infarction.  Diagnosis: Given her symptoms and history of recent severe emotional stress  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as “broken heart syndrome.”  Treatment Plan: Mrs. Lee was hospitalized and provided with supportive care  including oxygen and medications (ACE inhibitors  Beta-blockers  and diuretics) to manage her symptoms. Long-term  she was recommended stress management strategies as a critical part of her treatment plan due to the stress-related origin of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Prognosis: Most people recover quickly with appropriate treatment and lifestyle changes  especially stress management  but it's crucial that Mrs. Lee has regular check-ups to monitor her heart function. Ongoing collaboration with a cardiologist and mental health practitioner is highly recommended.  Conclusion: This case presentation exemplifies the significant impact of emotional stress on physical health  especially concerning cardiovascular diseases such as Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Early recognition and management of this condition are crucial to prevent severe complications  highlighting the importance of multidimensional approach in medicine.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,90,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. X  a 72-year-old Asian male  was recently hospitalized for sudden severe chest pain which occurred after he was notified about the unexpected demise of his close sister. He has been diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome.   Past Medical History:  Mr. X has a previous diagnosis of Hypertension  managed with oral medications  and Type II Diabetes  managed by diet control. He is also recently experiencing episodes of anxiety and mild depression  treated with SSRI medications.   Family History:  His father passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 68. His mother has a history of rheumatoid arthritis. His older sister  whose death triggered his episode  had breast cancer.   Social History:   A retired chemist  Mr. X has a moderate alcohol consumption history  non-smoker  married with three children settled separately.   Case Summary:  On arrival  Mr. X complained of sudden-onset severe chest pain associated with mild difficulty breathing. An EKG indicated mild ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. He reported that the pain started soon after receiving the news of his sister's demise. He has never had such chest pain before.   On examination  his vitals are stable except for elevated blood pressure. Physical examination is unremarkable except for mild respiratory distress.  He was immediately started on nitroglycerin and admitted to cardiology for further evaluation. His cardiac enzyme levels were slightly elevated  consistent with the diagnosis. An emergency angiography showed moderate narrowing of the coronary arteries but not significant to cause the severe chest pain and EKG changes.  A subsequent echocardiography revealed left ventricular apical ballooning with a preserved basal function  commonly described as """"Octopus pot"""" appearance  consistent with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Plan:  Mr. X was started on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for heart failure. He was advised to avoid strenuous activities. He was also suggested for cardiac rehabilitation. Psychiatric intervention was recommended considering his history of anxiety and recent stressor. He was recommended for regular follow-ups with his physician  psychiatrist  and Cardiologist.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the complexity of the Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  where physical or emotional triggers can lead to sudden acute heart failure even among patients with otherwise controlled cardiovascular risk factors. It stresses the importance of recognizing stressful life events as potential disease triggers  the consideration of mental health in patient therapy  and the need for multidisciplinary approaches to patient management.   (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more common in postmenopausal women  but it can affect men and people of all ages. In this case  the chosen patient character is a 72-year-old Asian male  for the sake of creating a more uncommon scenario and emphasizing that everyone can develop the condition.)"

She is a widow with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She is non-smoker and non-alcoholic and works as a retired school teacher.  History of Present Illness  Ms. Gonzales was brought into the ER after experiencing a sudden onset of severe chest pain while attending her granddaughter's wedding. Accompanying symptoms included mild breathlessness  palpitations  and profuse sweating.  Past Medical History  She has a history of hypertension  which is well-controlled with medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily). She is also on Atorvastatin 20mg daily for hyperlipidemia. There is no previous history of acute coronary syndrome  chest pain  or any cardiac condition. No history of diabetes  renal  hepatic or thyroid disease.   Family History  Her father died of a stroke at 75 and her mother had diabetes and died at the age of 88 due to complications of the disease. She has two older brothers  one deceased due to myocardial infarction at 70 and the other is living with coronary artery disease.   Physical Examination  Mrs. Gonzales was awake  alert and oriented but appeared anxious. Her blood pressure was 145/90 mmHg  pulse 110 beats per minute  and respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. She had normal heart sounds without murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Lungs were clear to auscultation. The remaining exam was unremarkable.  Investigations  Her ECG showed ST segment elevation suggestive of myocardial ischemia. Troponin levels were minimally elevated. Echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved basal function  a classic sign of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis  Based on her symptoms  ECG changes  echocardiography findings  and her recent emotional stress  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Management  She was treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors  beta blockers and was closely monitored in the cardiology unit. She was counselled about the importance of appropriate stress management strategies.  Follow-up  Her recovery was uneventful  and she was discharged on the 5th day. Mrs. Gonzales will be having regular follow-ups to monitor her cardiac function and ensure optimal control of blood pressure. She was advised to join a cardiac rehabilitation program.  Conclusion  This case is a classic presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome.""""

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,92,Subject: Case Presentation - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile:  Mrs. K  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presents with a chief complaint of severe chest pain radiating down her left arm  frequently characterized as exertional. She reports a stressful event she experienced a week ago  when she received the news of her sister's sudden death.  Medical History:  Mrs. K has a history of fluctuating high blood pressure and has been on a low-dose regimen of hydrochlorothiazide for the last 10 years. She is also diagnosed with mild depression and has been treated with an SSRI  specifically sertraline  for the last 3 years. There is a history of occasional smoking and mild alcohol use. No known drug allergies are reported.  Family History:  There is a notable history of cardiac deaths in her family. Her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 65  and her sister had an out of hospital cardiac arrest at the age of 64.   Clinical Presentation:  On presentation  Mrs. K is conscious  alert but obviously anxious. Her blood pressure reads 170/95 mmHg  and her heart rate is 110 beats per minute. Physical examination reveals a crisp 2nd heart sound with no audible murmurs.   Investigations and Diagnosis:  EKG reveals ST-segment elevation  suggesting an acute coronary syndrome. However  her Troponin I level  although elevated  is disproportionately low compared to the amount of ST-elevation seen in the EKG. Coronary angiography indicates no significant coronary artery stenosis  but ventriculography shows apical ballooning with impaired systolic function  consistent with the pattern seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Known in medical literature  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy predominantly affects postmenopausal women  as seen in the case of Mrs. K. The pathophysiology typically involves a preceding stressor event  and the clinical presentation is often similar to acute coronary syndrome  as seen here. Further echoing literature  acute changes in Mrs. K's cardiovascular markers (ECG and Troponins) in the absence of significant coronary artery disease led to the suspicion of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which was confirmed on ventriculography.  Management:  She was managed with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and supportive therapy. The antidepressant was continued keeping in mind the possible role of mental stress in the episode. She showed significant improvement over the period of a week and is currently scheduled for weekly follow-ups and therapy sessions.  This case highlights the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as part of the differential diagnosis in patients  especially postmenopausal women  who present with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome but have a notable history of intense stress and insufficient coronary artery disease to justify the clinical presentation.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,93,Patient Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile:   Ms. Donna Baker  71-year-old Caucasian female  hailing from semi-urban Massachusetts  presenting to the hospital with severe chest pain  dizziness  and shortness of breath.  Past Medical History:   Ms. Baker has a history of hypertension  adequately managed with medication - Lisinopril (20mg per day). She is a non-smoker and a teetotaler. She was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and had been on fluoxetine (20mg per day) for the last 10 years. There is no history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or any other cardiovascular-related diseases.  Presenting Complaint:  Ms. Baker has been consistently experiencing severe chest pain and shortness of breath for the past two days. A sudden emotional distress trigger was noted as her brother had passed away unexpectedly last week.  Diagnostic Evaluation:  Echocardiography disclosed left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning  typically consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her cardiac enzymes were moderately elevated  with troponin T at 0.62 ng/mL  and the EKG suggested ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Coronary angiography ruled out obstructive coronary disease.   Family History:  Her father died at the age of 68 of myocardial infarction. Her mother had cancer and passed away at 73. She has two sisters  both in good health  and one brother  who passed away recently.  Treatment:  Ms. Baker was admitted to the hospital under the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She maintained in the cardiac intensive care unit (CCU) for continuous monitoring and management of acute heart failure. She was initiated on beta-blockers (metoprolol)  ACE inhibitors (Lisinopril)  and aspirin. Furthermore  her anxiety medication was reassessed  switching from fluoxetine to a more cardiac-friendly escitalopram (10mg/day)  given the stress-related nature of her cardiomyopathy.   Prognosis:  With an earlier diagnosis and on-spot treatment initiation  Ms. Baker showed considerable progress. She remained hemodynamically stable and symptom-free during her hospital stay. Gradual improvement of the left ventricular function was noted upon sequential echocardiographic evaluation. Psychological counseling was advised along with cardiac rehabilitation activities.  Additional Note:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often called Broken Heart Syndrome  is more common in post-menopausal women. Emotional stress is typically imputed as the triggering factor  as exhibited in Ms. Baker's case  where she faced an emotional blow with her brother's sudden demise. It's crucial to manage the emotional part of the illness  along with the physical symptoms.   The patient's family was given genetics counseling  and blood tests for genetic markers for cardiac diseases were also advised.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,94,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. J is a 68-year-old Asian woman living in the city of San Francisco. She is a recent widow with no children and previously worked as a high school teacher.  Presenting Complaint:  She reports sudden onset of severe chest pain  resembling a heart attack. The pain began during a particularly high-stress event – the funeral of her husband. Additional symptoms include shortness of breath  nausea  and lightheadedness.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. In her younger years  she was a social smoker but has since quit. She exercises moderately and has a well-balanced diet. She also has a history of depression and anxiety disorders  which are well-controlled with medication and therapy.  Family History:  There is a family history of cardiovascular disease  as her mother died of heart failure at age 78. Her father succumbed to lung cancer  and her younger brother has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Diagnostic Findings:  On presentation  the patient appears diaphoretic and in severe distress. Intense T wave inversions are seen in the precordial leads of her ECG. Blood tests show elevated levels of troponin  indicative of heart muscle distress. Ventricular function assessed via echocardiography demonstrates apical ballooning with preserved basal function  compatible with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Therapeutic interventions included administration of a beta-blocker  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor  and anti-anxiety medication. The patient was closely monitored and eventually stepped down from the cardiac care unit to a regular ward. Stress management and mental health support were deemed an integral part of her holistic treatment plan.  Conclusion:  This case illuminates the importance of understanding stress-induced cardiomyopathy or Takotsubo syndrome  a condition that disproportionately affects postmenopausal women and can mimic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. High emotional stress was identified as the likely trigger.  As clinicians  it becomes paramount to provide not only appropriate cardiac care but also to address the mental health of patients diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This involves taking a more comprehensive approach to patient management. Other healthcare providers involved in Mrs. J's care include psychiatrists  psychologists  and social workers.   Mrs. J's cardiovascular manifestations were managed effectively  and she was discharged after one week. However  follow-up is crucial to monitor her mental and physical health  particularly considering her aforementioned risk factors and existing mental health issues.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,95,"Presenting Patient:   Mrs. X is a 65-year-old Asian Female who presented to the ED with sudden onset severe chest pain  radiating to back and associated with acute shortness of breath. As per her past medical history  she had hypertension and hyperlipidemia which were well controlled with medications and she denied any smoking or alcohol use. There is no known family history of early heart disease.   Clinical Course:  On physical examination  she was found to be in moderate respiratory distress with a BP of 170/100  HR of 110  and SpO2 of 89% on room air. Labs were significant for mildly elevated troponin-I (1.5 ng/mL.) On Chest X-ray  there were signs of mild pulmonary congestion  and her ECG showed QT prolongation with slight ST-Elevation in the anterior leads.   Given the constellation of symptoms  a possible Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) was suspected. However  her coronary angiogram showed no significant occlusive disease to explain her symptoms. Her left ventriculogram  on the other hand  showed a unique pattern of apical ballooning with preservation of the base of the heart  a characteristic sign of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  otherwise known as """"Broken Heart Syndrome.""""  Discussion:  The diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was unanticipated but fits with the presentation in this stressed postmenopausal woman - a demographic group in which Takotsubo is reported to have a higher incidence. Several hypotheses are proposed for the pathogenesis  notably the action of catecholamines causing myocardial stunning  and given her age and menopausal status  the cardioprotective estrogen effect is lost  predisposing her to this condition. Her chest pain and shortness of breath improved significantly over the next few days with supportive management. She was discharged with an appointment for outpatient follow-up.  In summary  this patient represents a case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy presenting as a possible ACS. This case exemplifies the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential in postmenopausal women presenting with chest pain  acute dyspnea  and ECG changes  especially considering the associated physical or emotional stressors they might be undergoing at that time."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,96,"Patient Profile: Mrs. Y is a 67-year-old African American retiree who resides with her husband in Boston  Massachusetts.   Medical Background: She has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  controlled with diet  losartan  and metformin. Mrs. Y also reports a history of anxiety disorder very well maintained with Paroxetine with no recent significant exacerbations. She has no known drug allergies.  Presenting Issue: Mrs. Y was brought to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset chest pain and dyspnea that began suddenly after receiving news of her brother's sudden death. She described her pain as similar to a """"heavy weight pressing down"""" on her chest. She denied having any other associated symptoms like nausea  vomiting  sweating  lightheadedness  or syncope.  Family History: She has a positive family history of cardiovascular diseases; her father died of myocardial infarction at 72 and her mother had a stroke at 78. Her brother had recently passed away from an unrevealed cause.   Clinical Examination: On examination  her pulse was 86 beats/min  blood pressure 145/92 mmHg  and respiratory rate 16 breaths/min. Her cardiovascular examination revealed no abnormalities; no murmurs were detected  and her peripheral pulses were intact.   Investigations: Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads V2-V4. Emergent coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease but showed left ventricular apical ballooning consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Diagnosis: Based on these findings coupled with her chest pain onset following a stressful event  Mrs. Y was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Therapy: She was treated conservatively with the continuation of her antihypertensives  beta-blockers as well as low-dose aspirin. Her condition improved over the next week with complete resolution of symptoms  and a repeat echocardiogram showed normalization of the left ventricular dysfunction.  Follow-up and Prognosis:  She was discharged with a psychosocial assessment to manage her ongoing grief and anxiety. Mrs. Y has follow-up appointments scheduled with her primary care provider and the cardiology clinic for routine monitoring and management of her condition. With proper treatment and emotional support  her prognosis is a complete recovery.  Discussion: This case demonstrates that takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  can result from intense emotional stress  even in patients with a known anxiety disorder. Prompt recognition and supportive management are vital  as this condition is typically reversible.   "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,97,Patient Profile: Ms. Greta Andersson  Female  72-year-old  Ethnicity: Caucasian   Residential Status: Living alone in urban Minnesota  Background: Ms. Andersson is married with 3 adult children and has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. She has been retired for the past 7 years after working as a school teacher for more than 40 years.  Presenting Complaint: The patient was admitted to the emergency department with symptoms of severe chest pain and shortness of breath.  Medical history: On questioning  Ms. Andersson reported a history of well-controlled hypertension and type-II diabetes. She does not have any known drug allergies. Ms. Andersson has also undergone a cholecystectomy 6 years ago. Her father suffered from coronary artery disease and her mother had high blood pressure.  Clinical Findings: On further examination  the patient’s vital signs were as follows- Blood pressure: 160/90 mmHg; Heart rate: 110 bpm; Respiratory rate: 22 bpm and oxygen saturation: 95% on room air. The remainder of her physical examination was unremarkable.  Tests/Treatment: The electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads and mild troponin I elevation. After initial management for acute coronary syndrome  an emergency coronary angiogram was performed that revealed normal coronary arteries but a significant decrease in the left ventricular function with apical ballooning indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Medical management was initiated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and antiplatelet therapy.  Assessment: Ms. Andersson’s symptoms and clinical findings  along with the angiogram results  were consistent with the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'  a stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Ms. Andersson  on extensive questioning  revealed that she has been under immense emotional stress following the sudden demise of her husband 2 days prior to the onset of symptoms.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  though not as common as other forms of heart disease  tends to affect postmenopausal women and can be triggered by severe emotional stress. The complete recovery rate is high if diagnosed and treated promptly with supportive medical therapy and stress management.  Future Approach: Ms. Andersson will be monitored closely and follow-up evaluations will be done to ensure recovery of the left ventricular function. Mental health support will be provided to help her cope with her loss and reduce her stress levels. She will be referred to a dietician to receive education on diabetic diet and to an endocrinologist for her diabetes management. Support from family members will be encouraged for emotional stability and better recovery.    This case underscores the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath  particularly in the setting of recent severe emotional stress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,98,"Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: Ms. L  a 68-year-old African American female  presented herself in the emergency department. She's a retired school teacher. She lives alone  twice divorced  with three grown children living out of state.   Past Medical History: The patient reports a history of hypertension  well-controlled with medication (Lisinopril 20mg/day). She denies history of ischemic heart disease or any other cardiac conditions. She has a past surgical history of hysterectomy due to benign fibroids 10 years ago. She does not smoke  drinks occasionally  and is not a known diabetic.   Presenting Symptoms: Ms. L arrived at the hospital reporting severe chest pain  similar to a """"heavy weight"""" pressing down on her. She described the pain as a scale of 8/10  with accompanying shortness of breath. Pain onset occurred that morning  seemingly out of nowhere while she was sipping her morning coffee.  Family History: Her mother died at the age of 82 due to congestive heart failure. Paternal history reveal heart attack at the age of 70 with father's subsequent death. One of her brothers had triple vessel disease and underwent coronary angioplasty. No family history of any cardiomyopathy was reported.   Investigations & Findings: A quick EKG revealed ST-segment elevation in precordial leads mimicking an acute myocardial infarction. Troponin levels were slightly increased. An immediate echocardiogram was performed revealing hyperkinesis of the basal segments and akinesis of the mid to apical segments of the left ventricle with preserved right ventricular function  creating the classic “apical ballooning” appearance. The left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly reduced.   Diagnosis: With these findings and after ruling out coronary artery disease through a coronary angiogram  Ms. L was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  or """"Broken Heart Syndrome.""""  Treatment:  She was managed conservatively with Beta blockers (Metoprolol 25 mg) and Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (Lisinopril increased to 40 mg). Given her emotional isolation  a psychiatric consultation was also suggested for possible stress management intervention.  Discussion: This case highlights TCM  an important differential in patients especially women in their post-menopausal phase  presenting with acute chest pain and EKG changes mimicking a heart attack. The disease has a strong association with acute emotional and physical stress  and while it was unclear during Ms. L's consultation  a predisposing stressor (death of a close friend) was found during her psychiatric evaluation  underlining the importance of looking beyond the medical history and understanding psychological factors in such conditions.   Management of associated emotional factors has been shown to improve prognosis in this potentially reversible cause of acute heart failure. Thus  a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach toward such patients  as displayed in the case of Ms. L  is prudent."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,99,Patient Presentation  Ms. Aida  a 67-year-old African American female  presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset chest pain and shortness of breath. She reports she was at her deceased husband’s funeral when she started feeling unwell. She describes her pain as a crushing sensation in the chest  not relieving with rest.  Past Medical History  She has a history of controlled hypertension and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago  which is managed through diet and Metformin. No known history of coronary artery disease. Her other past medical history includes well-managed hypothyroidism and mild osteoarthritis. No history of smoking or alcohol addiction  but she reports life-long anxiety which got severe after her husband's recent passing.  Family History  She is a widow with two adult children  both living independently. Her deceased husband had a history of cardiovascular disease and died from myocardial infarction. Her mother died in her 70s due to congestive heart failure and her father from a stroke. Her two brothers are alive and well with no reported cardiovascular diseases.  Physical Examination  Vital signs reveal blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg  heart rate 115 beats per minute  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  temperature 98.6℉  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Cardio-respiratory exam reveals mild tachycardia and normal breath sounds bilaterally.  Investigations  Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) shows abnormalities mimicking myocardial infarction; there is a ST-elevation in the anterolateral leads. Elevated levels of troponin T are noted  but coronary angiography shows no significant blockage of coronary arteries  inconsistent with a traditional heart attack. Echocardiogram reveals a characteristic ‘takotsubo’ pattern of the left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction of 35%.  Diagnosis  Based on these findings  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) or stress-induced cardiomyopathy  often referred to as 'Broken Heart Syndrome.' It’s speculated that her chronic anxiety disorder and acute emotional trauma of her husband's death could have precipitated this event.  Management  Management included beta-blocker therapy and ACE inhibitors for initial acute management. She was also advised to go for the stress management techniques and mental health counselling due to her chronic anxiety history and recent emotional upheaval.  Summary  This case illustrates the importance of considering TTC in older women presenting with symptoms mimicking a heart attack  especially when there’s a history of emotional stress  anxiety disorders  or recent life-changing events. It also underscores the significance of a holistic approach  where the patient’s mental health is evaluated and managed alongside their physical symptoms for optimal outcomes.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,9,100,"Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information Patient: Mrs. Jones Age: 68 years old Ethnicity: Caucasian Gender: Female  Chief Complaint: Chest pain  shortness of breath   History of Present Illness: Mrs. Jones presented to the emergency room complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started about 2 hours prior to arrival. She describes the pain as crushing that radiates to the left arm. She also reports feeling """"nauseous and lightheaded."""" She mentions that she experienced a similar but less severe episode about a week ago.   Her symptoms started suddenly today  while she was dealing with an emotionally stressful situation involving her sick husband.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Jones has a history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her BMI falls within the overweight category. She is a non-smoker and has no known drug allergies. She has been under chronic stress due to the recent loss of her daughter to cancer a year ago.  Family History: She has a family history of cardiovascular disease. Her father suffered heart attacks and passed away at the age of 72  while her mother has a history of stroke.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  Mrs. Jones appeared anxious and short of breath. Heart rate was 110 beats per minute  blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable.   Investigations: Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevations. Laboratory tests showed a slight increase in cardiac enzymes. A subsequent echocardiogram showed abnormal left ventricular function with apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesis  suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis: Based on her symptoms  ECG findings  and echocardiogram results  Mrs. Jones was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which primarily affects postmenopausal women  is often preceded by a stressful event. The syndrome often mimics acute coronary syndrome and is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction.  Management: Mrs. Jones was admitted for close monitoring and supportive care. Her hypertension was managed with ace inhibitors and beta-blockers. She received counseling to manage her emotional stress and was referred for cardiology follow-up.  The case of Mrs. Jones highlights the potential influence of psychological stress on heart health  particularly in older adults with prior cardiovascular risk factors. Ultimately  takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be considered in patients who present with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome  particularly in the context of recent significant stressors.   Informed consent was taken from the patient for case discussion and presentation. The case report adheres to the CARE guidelines for case reports."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,1,"Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Ms. Jane Doe  a 68-year old Asian female  widow  retired teacher  living with her older daughter after the sudden death of her husband a year ago. She is a non-smoker and non-drinker.  Presenting Complaint: Jane presents with sudden chest pain  and shortness of breath. She describes the pain as a """"squeezing"""" sensation  similar to what she has read about heart attacks  which started suddenly after receiving news of a close friend's death. Jane also mentions a high level of stress and anxiety due to her husband's death and the recent mourning of a close friend. She also complains about occasional dizziness.  Past Medical History: Jane has a past medical history notable for hypertension (on lisinopril)  hyperlipidemia (on atorvastatin)  and mild anxiety disorder (untreated). She has had no previous cardiac history  and her recent routine mammogram and colonoscopy were normal. Jane has maintained a relatively healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and balanced diet.  **It's important to note that while takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) can affect anyone regardless of age  gender  or health status  it is seen more frequently in postmenopausal women with an averaged age of 67 years old. It's also more commonly reported in individuals of Asian descent compared to other racial or ethnic groups. Additionally  emotional stress  such as the death of a loved one  is often a trigger of this syndrome.**  Key Learning Points:  - The case should facilitate discussion about how stress can lead to serious heart issues  specifically takotsubo cardiomyopathy. - An understanding of the pathophysiology of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. - The role of patient's medical history in the diagnosis and management of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  recalling her hypertension and hyperlipidemia which may confound or exacerbate takotsubo cardiomyopathy. - The students should also learn to identify symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath  to be able to consider and differentiate between other conditions with similar presentations such as myocardial infarction.  - Management of takotsubo cardiomyopathy including both short and long term strategies should be also discussed."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,2,"Patient Information: Mrs. Harriet Smith  a 71-year-old Asian female.  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Smith arrives at the emergency department reporting sudden  severe chest pain that is similar to previous heart attack pain she has experienced. She mentions that this attack was preceded by an extreme emotional event.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Smith has a history of hypertension which has been managed with lifestyle modifications and medication for the last 10 years. She had an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) approximately 6 years ago  managed successfully with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).  Furthermore  she shares that she has been under considerable emotional stress due to the recent sudden death of her husband. She doesn't report any history of endocrine or autoimmune diseases but mentions she had a minor hypothyroidism identified during a wellness check-up that didn't demand treatment.  Medications: She is currently on aspirin  a beta-blocker (Metoprolol)  an ACE inhibitor (Lisinopril) and a statin (Atorvastatin) for her cardiac condition. She also takes Calcium and Vitamin D supplements for her bone health.  Lifestyle and Social History: Mrs. Smith used to smoke in her 30s but quit smoking almost 35 years ago. She doesn't consume alcohol or use illicit drugs. She lives alone since her husband's death. She has been feeling very anxious and stressed lately.  Key Complaints: The key differential diagnosis based on the presenting complaint of severe chest pain in the context of significant emotional stress will be Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken-heart syndrome"""". Other diagnoses to consider in the differential include acute coronary syndrome  myocardial infarction  and anxiety/panic disorder. Since this patient has a history of heart attack  it's important to rule out acute coronary syndrome first. However  the connection to a severe emotional event  the demographics (postmenopausal Asian woman)  along with the severe chest pain could point towards Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Note: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is often triggered by severe stress and can cause severe heart muscle failure. The condition is most commonly seen in postmenopausal women and is often preceded by an intense emotional event. Symptoms are similar to a heart attack  including severe chest pain and shortness of breath. This case study will explore the possibility of Mrs. Smith experiencing an episode of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."

There was no history of cough  fever  palpitations  nausea  vomiting  radiating pain  or any other symptom.  NOTE:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome ' commonly affects post-menopausal women  often following a significant emotional or physical stressor. Hence  our protagonist for the case is a 69-year-old Caucasian female  reflecting an accurate demographic representation of the majority of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients.   Care should be taken to explain to students that although this demographic is most frequently affected  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can occur in members of any demographic or age group.  WRAP-UP: This case is designed to teach students to consider Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis for older women with acute coronary syndrome-like symptoms  especially if precipitated by a significant stressor  even in the absence of typical risk factors for cardiovascular disease. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,5,"Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also referred to as """"broken heart syndrome""""  usually affects postmenopausal women and its presentation can mimic that of acute coronary syndrome. Psychological stress is often a trigger. Here is a case study simulation designed for educating medical students:  Patient Demographics: Ms. Reese  a 68-year-old Caucasian woman who currently resides in the suburbs with her husband of 40 years. She is a retired nurse and enjoys gardening  book club and spending time with her two grandchildren.  Past Medical History: She has a past medical history of hypertension  for which she takes amlodipine 5mg daily  and she underwent a hysterectomy 15 years ago due to uterine fibroids. She has no history of smoking  and only drinks alcohol socially  within recommended limits. She's allergic to penicillin  resulting in a rash. She's been relatively hale and hearty her entire life with no prior cardiac issues.  Presenting Complaint: Ms. Reese presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath  which began when she received news of her brother's passing earlier that same day. The chest pain is central  radiating to her left arm and has been constant for the last two hours. There is no history of similar pain in the past.  Conclusion: In this case  the demographic of the patient (a postmenopausal woman experiencing a stressful event) along with the symptoms mimicking that of an acute coronary syndrome  a Takotsubo cardiomyopathy could be a differential diagnosis that students should consider. The primary teaching focus should be the approach to a patient presenting with chest pain and how to appropriately manage them to ensure any life-threatening conditions are promptly recognized and treated.  Disclaimer:  This case study is not meant to diagnose medical conditions and is constructed for educational purposes only. A real-life situation should involve comprehensive medical diagnosis and management by licensed  practicing physicians."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,6,"Case Report:  Patient Information:   Mrs. Maria Garcia  a 70-year-old Hispanic female from a Middle-Class background  presented to the emergency department.  Past Medical History:   A retired school teacher  Mrs. Garcia has a medical history of well-controlled hypertension and occasional migraines. She hasn't been diagnosed with any major illnesses in the past but has recently been under considerable emotional stress due to the passing of her husband.  Chief Complaint:   Mrs. Garcia reports a sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath  which occurred while she was at her husband's memorial service. The pain was sudden and intense  radiating to her left arm  and she compares it to a feeling of """"an elephant standing on her chest."""" These symptoms were associated with feelings of lightheadedness and profuse sweating. There were no reported episodes of nausea  vomiting  or loss of consciousness.  Additional Information:   Mrs. Garcia’s EKG showed ST-segment elevation common in acute coronary syndrome. However  prompt angiography revealed no significant blockage or plaque-rupture in her coronary arteries. Echocardiography showed a distinctive pattern of left ventricular dysfunction with basal hyperkinesis and apical akinesis  characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Laboratory results highlighted slightly elevated cardiac troponin levels.  Case Objective:  Through this case  the students will learn to differentiate between takotsubo cardiomyopathy and other cardiac events  understand the crucial role of emotional stress in precipitating such episodes  and manage this condition accordingly.   Rationale:   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome """" primarily affects postmenopausal women (like the patient in this case). It is often triggered by severe emotional stress. The presentation often mimics acute coronary syndrome  but coronary angiograms show no obstructive coronary artery disease. This condition was named takotsubo cardiomyopathy because the left ventricle of the heart takes a shape that resembles a Japanese pot called a """"Takotsubo."""" Although less common than other forms of heart disease  understanding and recognizing takotsubo cardiomyopathy is essential for appropriate patient care."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,7,"Patient Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics:   Patient is a 71-year-old Caucasian female named Mrs. Smith. She is a retired teacher  lives with her husband in a suburban area  and has two adult children. She is 1.65m tall and weighs 70kg.   Past Medical History:   Mrs. Smith is a non-smoker and drinks wine occasionally. She has had no significant past medical history until recently when she was diagnosed with hypertension  for which she has been taking Lisinopril 10 mg once daily for the past 8 months. She has no known allergies and has never undergone any major surgeries. There is a no history of heart disease in her immediate family.  Key Complaints:   Mrs. Smith was rushed to the emergency department with severe chest pain amidst a family confrontation. She describes the pain as sudden in onset  severe  crushing  and radiating to her left arm. She also reports feeling """"an indescribable fear""""  along with dizziness  and shortness of breath. She denies prior episodes of similar pain or any recent exertional activities prior to the onset of the pain.  Justification:  The demographics of this case has been designed based on the general profile of patients experiencing Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy as reported in scientific literature. This condition is most common among postmenopausal women  typically triggered by intense physical or emotional stress. This instance matches both critical factors  as Mrs. Smith is a postmenopausal female with no significant past medical history indicating a robust baseline health. Also  the simultaneous occurrence of this illness with severe emotional stress during a family dispute aligns with the common triggers of takotsubo cardiomyopathy."

Past Medical History: Hypertension  well-controlled with amlodipine; no known instances of ischemic heart disease or other cardiovascular illnesses. No other chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  or malignancy. No known family history of cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac death. Mild osteoarthritis. No known drug allergies.  Key Complaints: The patient was brought into the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of severe chest pain  palpitations  and shortness of breath. The pains were described as """"crushing"""" and not relieved by rest. Additionally  the patient had been experiencing persistent mild fatigue and lightheadedness for the past two weeks. The patient reports that she felt occasional heart palpitations over the same period - an irregular heartbeat that she had never noticed before. She felt lightheaded while trying to stand up from a sitting position multiple times during this period. No associated symptoms of cough  orthopnea  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  Additional Note: It’s important to note that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or ‘broken heart syndrome ’ is more common in postmenopausal women and often precipitated by severe emotional or physical stress. The stressor may not always be identifiable. In a typical case  the apex and mid-segments of left ventricles show balloon-like dilation with hyperkinesis of the base of the heart  imitating the octopus trap """"takotsubo""""."

Non-smoker  occasional drinker  Presenting Complaints: - Sudden  severe chest pain radiating to her left arm - Shortness of breath  - Pale and sweaty - Nausea  with a feeling of impending doom - Symptoms started an hour after she received news of her brother's sudden death  Course of Disease:  Ms. Wilson was rushed to the hospital following her symptoms' onset. On examination  her blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg  pulse rate was irregular at 110 bpm  and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute. She was pale and sweaty  visibly distressed.  Initial ECG suggested acute coronary syndrome  with significant ST elevation in anterior and inferolateral leads. However  subsequent coronary angiography showed no significant occlusion in her coronary arteries that would explain her severe symptoms and ECG changes.  Due to the discrepancy between her symptoms and angiography findings  and considering the stressful event she encountered  an echocardiogram was performed demonstrating apical ballooning  indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""").   Her brain natriuretic peptide was significantly elevated  supporting the diagnosis.   With supportive treatment including Beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors  along with psychological support  her condition improved. Repeat echocardiogram after 2 months showed a complete reversal of ventricular abnormalities with normal cardiac function.  Learning Objectives: - Importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in differential diagnosis of acute chest pain  especially in postmenopausal women with recent severe emotional stress - Recognize the discrepancy between clinical symptoms  ECG changes and coronary angiography results in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy - Understand the management of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy - Recognize the role of emotional stress in the onset of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy "

She has had a worsening feeling of nausea  acute episodes of vomiting  and lightheadedness. The patient also reported heightened anxiety and a feeling of impending doom prior to the onset of the chest pain. An element of potential emotional triggers contributing to the presentation of symptoms was also noted  as the chest pain commenced suddenly after a heated argument with her husband. The patient has no previous history of such chest pain.  According to the available literature  several demographic attributes align with the typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  including the patient's age  gender  and postmenopausal status. There's an established link between this condition and individuals who have experienced stressful situations or have a history of anxiety disorders  also reflected in this case. Therefore  takotsubo cardiomyopathy – also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""" – represents a significant diagnostic consideration in our case."

She lives alone but maintains regular social contact with family and close friends. She doesn't smoke or drink alcohol and maintains a mild regular exercise routine.  Past Medical History: Ms. A. is generally healthy and her previous medical history only indicates well-controlled hypertension  which has been managed with a low dose of a thiazide diuretic for the last 10 years. She does not have any history of psychiatric disorders  substance abuse  diabetes  or familial heart conditions. She had a normal mammography and colonoscopy at the age of 50 as a part of routine cancer screening.  Key Complaints: Ms. A. came to the Emergency Department complaining of severe chest pain that was sudden in onset. The chest pain started approximately 2 hours ago on the left side of her chest  and she described it as a severe crushing-type pain radiating to her left shoulder and neck. During this episode  she also experienced shortness of breath  nausea  and felt unusually anxious. The symptoms started while she was attending her daughter's wedding. She mentioned that while she was happy  the event was incredibly stressful due to significant family dynamics.  Background Note: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is seen predominantly in postmenopausal women and can often be precipitated by intense emotional or physical stress. This stress can cause sudden and severe heart muscle weakness (cardiomyopathy). Ethnic differences in the prevalence of takotsubo syndrome have not been well-studied  but a mix of populations reflects real-world settings. This case intend to highlight the real-world applicability of takotsubo cardiomyopathy diagnosis and management for students.   Learning Objective: The aim of the case is for students to learn about the typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  the prevalence of the disorder in postmenopausal women  and the importance of stress as a trigger factor. Moreover  it will learn students how to distinguish between takotsubo cardiomyopathy and acute coronary syndrome  and how to successfully manage the patient's symptoms and decrease the chances of recurrence.

Given the age  gender  and racial predominance of takotsubo cardiomyopathy mainly in postmenopausal women and a higher incidence in Asians  this case serves as an appropriate case report. The clinical manifestation of acute onset severe chest pain points toward a cardiovascular event. The background history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and a family history of coronary artery disease  together point toward a possibility of acute coronary syndrome. However  the acute emotional trigger hints at takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is commonly triggered by severe emotional or physical stress.   Note: The story would further unfold with her admission to the hospital  where diagnostic tests such as an EKG  complete blood count  cardiac biomarkers  echocardiogram  and angiography would be done to corroborate the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,15,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:  A 68-year-old Asian woman  married with 2 adult children  a retired school teacher  and non-smoker  presented to the hospital with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath  having a body mass index (BMI) of 24  a resident of a suburban neighborhood.  Past Medical History:  This patient has a history of hypertension managed by medication for the last 10 years with good control. She has no history of diabetes or hyperlipidemia. She has a known history of anxiety for which she takes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). There is no known family history of coronary artery disease. She has no previous history of cardiovascular events or conditions. She consumes alcohol socially and does light physical activity regularly.  Chief Complaint:  She described the chest pain as squeezing or a heavy feeling in the chest  which began suddenly following an intense argument with her husband  along with shortness of breath. She denies pain in her jaw  shoulder  arm  or back.  This case report represents a typical patient with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition seen predominantly in postmenopausal women and often triggered by significant emotional or physical stress. The demographic details  including age and ethnicity  align with the common demographic characteristic of patients with this condition as described in published literature. The patient's history of anxiety may play a role in the pathophysiology of this condition  given the common link between takotsubo cardiomyopathy and emotional stress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,16,Patient Demographics: Gender: Female Age Range: 75-80 Ethnicity: Non-Hispanic Caucasian Socioeconomic Status: Middle-class  Residing an urban area Occupation: Retired elementary school teacher  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of postmenopausal status  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  all maintained well on lifestyle changes and medications. She was recently bereaved  her husband died approximately six months prior. No personal or family history of any heart disease. Normal cholesterol and lipid levels. No other known genetic conditions or health-related issues.  Key Complaints: The patient presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe chest pain and difficulty breathing. The intensity of the pain is described as 8 on a scale of 10. Although she initially believed it to be a heartburn episode associated with her regular antacid not being effective  the prolonged pain made her seek immediate medical help. The onset of symptoms was sudden  occurring approximately one hour prior to presentation while she was having an emotional discussion with her daughter about her deceased husband. The patient complains of a light-headed feeling and impending sense of doom.  This case is designed around the demographic most commonly associated with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome)  which is post-menopausal women. The psychological stress of losing her husband is also important as the syndrome is often triggered by severe stress. The symptoms can mimic those of a heart attack  which could initially confuse diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,17,Patient Profile:   Mrs. Himari Suzuki  a 67-year-old Japanese female  presented to the emergency department. She is a retired school teacher and lives with her husband in a suburban area. Her BMI is maintained at 23  she is a non-smoker and has given birth to 3 children. She drinks occasionally  about two to three drinks per week.  Past Medical History:  She has been hypertensive for 20 years  controlled with Calcium Channel Blockers and ACE inhibitors. She is also being treated for hypercholesterolemia. No history of diabetes  fast foods  or sedentary lifestyle was reported. Hypercholesterolemia is treated with statins. Her last known values for cholesterol and lipid profile were within normal ranges. She was diagnosed with functional dyspepsia two years ago. Her medications include Amlodipine 5 mg once daily  Ramipril 2.5 mg once daily  and Rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily. She has no known drug allergies. She has no family history of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) or other heart disease. She had an annual health check-up each year and the last ECG 6 months ago was normal.  Key Complaints:  Mrs. Suzuki presented to the ER with sudden onset  severe chest pain at rest that had started 2 hours ago. She describes the pain as crushing and dull  localized in the center of the chest  radiating towards the jaw and left arm. She also reported feeling sweaty  nauseous  and light-headed. According to her  the chest pain began abruptly when she was watching a news broadcast about a severe earthquake that had struck her childhood city  causing numerous casualties  including some of her distant family members. She was extremely distraught and anxious.  Considering her age  sex  ethnicity and key symptoms  the immediate suspicion of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) is plausible given its higher incidence in post-menopausal women with a recent emotional trigger. Yet  her symptoms could also represent a myocardial infarction  therefore immediate investigations such as an ECG  Troponin T/ I  and later an echocardiogram or angiogram to confirm  are vital.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,18,Patient Case: Mrs. O  Demographics: Mrs. O is a 72-year-old Asian woman. She is a retired school teacher who lives with her husband. She is a non-smoker and rarely drinks alcohol.  Past Medical History: Mrs. O has a past medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  well controlled with antihypertensive and statin medications  respectively. She has a body mass index of 24.2. Her family history discloses a father who passed away from myocardial infarction at the age of 70.  Key Complaints: Mrs. O presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of chest pain and mild breathlessness  which appeared following a heated argument with her husband. The pain started at home  radiating to her left arm and neck. The pain is described as a severe squeezing sensation  scoring 8 on a pain scale of 10. She has no history of similar chest pain before. She denied symptoms like nauseation  vomiting  or palpitations.  Rationale: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress- or broken-heart syndrome  is more prevalent in postmenopausal women and typically about 90% of diagnosed cases are females between ages 58 and 75. Stressful emotional triggers are often associated with the onset of TTC  hence the portrayal of an argument prior to symptom onset. Also  the presence of co-morbidities like hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are kept in line with real-world demographics. Asians  especially Japanese (where the disease was first described  also the source of disease name – 'Takotsubo' meaning 'octopus pot' in Japanese)  show relatively higher incidences. Lastly  the emphasis on symptoms mimicking acute coronary syndrome is to drill home the important differential diagnosis aspect for the learners.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,19,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 68-year old Caucasian female of average center-for-age body mass index. She is a retiree  lives alone  and is a widow  with two adult children living out of state.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of hypertension  which is well controlled through medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily). Other medical history includes osteoporosis and mild Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). The patient has never smoked and consumes alcohol occasionally.   Presenting Complaints:  The patient presents to the emergency department of the hospital with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her back  accompanied by shortness of breath. She also reports mild lightheadedness and vomiting. She explains that she has been under tremendous stress for the last couple of weeks due to the unexpected death of her close friend.  Note: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome """" is a temporary heart condition that is often brought on by stressful situations  in this case  the death of a close friend. This condition is most commonly observed in post-menopausal women  making an aged Caucasian woman an accurate demographic representation for this case."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,20,Case Report  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old Japanese woman living in a suburban area. She presents as a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. The patient is a widow who lives alone  with 3 adult children living in different cities.  Past Medical History: History reveals she is a known case of well-managed hypertension and has been treated for general anxiety disorder over the past five years. She has no history of diabetes mellitus  coronary artery disease  or any other cardiac diseases. She is not taking any other medications apart from an antihypertensive (olmesartan 20mg per day) and an SSRI (escitalopram 10mg per day). The patient's mother had a history of myocardial infarction in her late seventies.  Complaints: The patient was brought to the hospital following an acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath occurring for a few hours mainly on exertion after receiving shocking news of her eldest son's sudden death. On examination  she is visibly distressed  and her BP is noted to be 160/90 mmHg  Heart Rate is 110 bpm  Regular. Her ECG on arrival shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  mimicking a myocardial infarction.  The patient's complaints  demographics  history  and initial investigations suggest the possibility of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often known as broken heart syndrome due to her sudden emotional stress event.  NB: According to literature  takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more common among postmenopausal women  especially over 50 years of age. It occurs frequently after an emotionally stressful event and can mimic a heart attack in its presentation. Conditions like hypertension and use of SSRI might make her more susceptible to develop takotsubo cardiomyopathy in an acute stress situation. This choice of a non-white patient is intentional to represent growing evidence of diverse experiences of disease and challenge stereotype assumptions of “typical” patient presentations. The case should also include a discussion about diagnostic steps like Echocardiography  Troponin I levels  and Coronary Angiogram  along with the differential diagnosis and treatment management. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,21,Patient Case: Mrs. S. Y.  Demographics:   Mrs. S. Y. is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher  living with her husband in a suburban community. She recently lost her only daughter two months ago due to a tragic accident.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. S. Y. has a medical history significant for well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has been on a regime of Metformin and Lisinopril for the past 5 years. She is a non-smoker and seldom drinks. The family history reveals a father who died due to myocardial infarction.  Current Complaints:  Mrs. S. Y. presents to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain. She describes the pain as crushing and similar to a ‘heart attack ’ radiating to her left arm and jawline. She states the pain came on suddenly while she was visiting her daughter’s grave.  Her pain is associated with shortness of breath  nausea  and a feeling of impending doom. She denies any history of similar episodes in the past.  This case presentation is representative of the demographic trend often seen in takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome. It tends to disproportionately affect post-menopausal women who have recently experienced severe emotional trauma. The patient's complaints and history may initially push one to suspect acute myocardial infarction which is a more common condition. However  students should keep in mind the existence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy especially  in women with a recent history of severe emotional distress. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,22,"Case Summary:  Patient Demographics:  Name: Mrs. Linda Martinez  Gender: Female Age: 72 Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic  Occupation: Retired school teacher Home: Lives alone  with her daughter and family living nearby Smoking status: Non-smoker  Physical activity: Walks twice a week Alcohol intake: Social drinker   Past Medical History: Hypertension - well controlled with medication Type II Diabetes Mellitus - diagnosed five years back  managed through diet  exercise  and medication. Anxiety disorder - diagnosed ten years ago  in remission with the help of therapy and medication.  Presenting Complaints:  Mrs. Martinez presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She described the chest pain as """"a gripping sensation'' in her left chest  radiating to her left arm. This occurred in the early hours of the morning  a few hours after receiving distressing news about her youngest grandson's health.  The frequency of such an instance is the first time as mentioned by the patient  and she did not report any recent injuries  palpitations  or episodes of fainting. Her vital signs upon arrival show stable and normal readings except for a heart rate of 105 bpm.  As per reported statistics  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  often occurs more frequently in postmenopausal women with a mean age of 66-75 years. The disease often presents with symptoms similar to myocardial infarction  including chest pain and shortness of breath. Stress is a common precipitating factor  often emotional or physical. Therefore  Mrs. Martinez's demographic information  medical history  and presenting complaints align with those typically seen in a case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,23,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Demographics: Age: 68 Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian  Mrs. Suzanne Parker  is a 68-year-old  recently widowed Caucasian woman  living alone in the suburban area of Milwaukee. She has two adult children living out of state. She is a retired high-school teacher and has been maintaining a balanced diet and indulging in regular exercise most of her life. She has a past history of hypertension  for which she is on medication  but otherwise she reports to have had a generally good health.   Past Medical History: - Essential Hypertension: Diagnosed 8 years back. She has been adherent to her prescribed antihypertensive medications. - Mrs. Parker denies any smoking or drug history. - She has no known allergies. - She has been recently been experiencing severe stress due to the loss of her husband.  Presenting Complaints: Today  Mrs. Parker has presented in the Emergency Department after experiencing unexpected severe chest pain while she was at her husband's memorial service. She describes the pain as severe  gripping type  centered on the left side of the chest  and radiating to the jaw. She also reports shortness of breath  palpitations  and a """"sense of impending doom"""". These symptoms are new to her and she has no prior history of any similar episodes.  Note for the educator:   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as Broken Heart Syndrome  often presents much like an acute coronary syndrome  with chest pain and shortness of breath. The condition is often precipitated by severe stress or emotional trauma  such as the loss of a loved one. Although it can affect people of all ages and genders  it is much more common in postmenopausal women. The role of the educator here would be to highlight the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis  particularly given the patient's recent emotional trauma  despite the presentation being similar to that of a more common condition such as myocardial infarction. It is essential to learn how to separate these two conditions as their management strategies differ. This is why this case would be of great teaching value."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,24,Case Report - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information and Chief Complaint: Ms. Eva Garcia  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presents with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath which began a few hours ago.  Demographics: Ms. Garcia is a retired high school teacher. She lives with her youngest son and his family after getting widowed over a year ago. She is a lifelong non-smoker and has a moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: Ms. Garcia has been hypertensive for the past ten years  controlled with regular medication. She also has a history of hyperlipidemia for which she has been taking statins. She has no history of diabetes  thyroid disease  previous heart disease  or other systemic illnesses. She has been under psychological stress since the death of her husband.  Initial Assessment: Enroute to the hospital  the medical team recorded an elevated heart rate (112 bpm)  elevated blood pressure (160/100 mmHg)  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per min  oxygen saturation levels of 94% on room air  and mild distress due to pain.   This clinical case would then unfold to discuss takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition often triggered by severe stress and more commonly found in post-menopausal women. Examining the clinical signs  ECG examination  blood test evaluation  echocardiography results  and angiography findings could help students arrive at the final diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Key Learning Objectives: 1. Understand the clinical presentation and diagnostic workup for takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 2. Understand the importance of considering such syndromes in the differential when elderly women present with chest pain. 3. Learn about the management and follow-up care for patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 4. Be aware of the link between emotional stress and heart diseases. 5. Understand the potential for misdiagnosis since the condition often mimics a heart attack.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,25,"Case Report ------------ Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 68-year-old Asian female  non-smoker  with a BMI of 23. She is retired and has been living alone since becoming a widow 5 years ago.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of controlled hypertension and well-regulated type II diabetes. She has occasionally suffered from panic attacks since her husband's death. She does not drink alcohol  and denies using recreational drugs. There is a family history of heart disease  her mother had ischemic heart disease and died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. The patient is physically active and maintains a healthy diet. The only medications she is currently taking are amlodipine 5 mg daily for hypertension and metformin 500 mg twice daily for diabetes.  Key Complaints: The patient presents to the emergency department with acute  severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started a few hours ago. She describes the pain as """"stabbing"""" and located in the center of her chest  radiating to her left shoulder. The pain began suddenly during a telephone call when she learned about her brother's unexpected death.  These symptoms are accompanied by light-headedness  nausea  and a sense of impending doom. The patient denies any similar previous episodes.  Notably  the patient suffered an intense panic attack concurrent with the onset of these symptoms. She has had no relief with rest and has presented to the emergency department with a fear she is having a 'heart attack'. Upon arrival  patient appears anxious and in distress  intermittently crying.  This case of an elderly Asian female experiencing severe chest pain after sudden emotional distress is intended to introduce the concept of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (a.k.a. broken heart syndrome) to the medical students. The demographic representation is based on available literature indicating that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy more frequently affects postmenopausal women and can be triggered by severe emotional stress. It is also seen more commonly in people of Asian descent."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,26,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: Mrs. Y is a 67-year-old Asian female who recently retired from teaching. She presents as a widow living alone  and she is generally physically active and independent. She is a non-smoker with no known drug allergies.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Y's medical history includes controlled hypertension (on Lisinopril)  type 2 diabetes (on Metformin)  and hyperlipidemia (on Atorvastatin)  all diagnosed within the past decade. She also underwent cholecystectomy 18 years ago. She does not have any background of cardiological issues. Her parents had a history of cardiovascular disease  primarily hypertension.   Key Complaints: Mrs. Y presents with acute onset severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  associated with shortness of breath that started earlier this morning. She mentions a significant stressor - the sudden demise of her only child two weeks ago. This loss caused her emotional distress  leading to sleep disturbances and lack of appetite. During her presentation  she denies a history of nausea  vomiting  dizziness  or palpitations.   Note:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is also called stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome."""" It is typically seen in post-menopausal women  often associated with severe emotional stress. The patient's severe chest pain mimicking symptoms of a myocardial infarction  juxtaposed against the recent significant emotional stress  aligns her within the common demographic and clinical figures seen with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. This scenario provides an excellent opportunity for students to learn about this condition  its presentation  differential diagnosis  and management."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,27,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics:  Name: Mrs. Martha Stevenson Age: 68 years old Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired School Teacher Location: Michigan  USA  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Stevenson has been generally healthy throughout her life. She has a history of hypertension managed with thiazide diuretics and beta-blocker. She lost her husband a year ago. She has no history of smoking  excessive alcohol use  or illicit drug use. She has previous psychiatric diagnoses of depression and anxiety for which she is on SSRIs. She has no known family history of heart disease.  Key Complaints:  Mrs. Stevenson presented to the emergency department with acute onset  severe chest pain of 2 hours duration  described as a heavy pressing sensation. The pain started while she was attending her grandson's graduation ceremony. She also complained of mild shortness of breath and feeling of apprehension. The pain did not radiate elsewhere and was not relieved with rest. She denied any symptoms of nausea  vomiting or diaphoresis.  Discussion:  This case revolves around Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  which is a temporary heart condition often brought on by stressful situations and extreme emotions. It commonly affects post-menopausal women and the presentation can mimic that of an acute myocardial infarction. Stressors like Mrs. Stevenson's emotional event during the graduation can be triggers.   Although the majority of patients do not have a history of mental illness  the current literature suggests that anxiety disorders are found in approximately 30% of patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. In Mrs. Stevenson's case  this link is important to consider.   Her past medical history of hypertension is also consistent with demographic findings  as nearly 50% to 80% of patients diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  exhibit hypertension. Also  patients tend to have generally low prevalence of classical cardiovascular risk factors like smoking or high cholesterol.  Further investigations such as Electrocardiogram (ECG)  cardiac biomarkers  and possibly an echocardiogram or cardiac MRI might show findings consistent with the typical or atypical forms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  This case fits into the broader demographic representation most accurately  allowing for an in-depth case study of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Training around such a case can help medical students recognize this condition when they encounter it in their professional practice. "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,28,Patient Information:   Mrs. Robinson  71-year-old widowed African-American female living with her daughter's family.  Present Complaints:  She presents with severe chest pain  pressure  and dyspnea (shortness of breath) following a sudden  significant emotional stressor (unexpected death of her close friend).   Past Medical History:  Mrs. Robinson has a history of well-controlled hypertension for the past five years. She is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. There is no history of heart disease in her family. She has never had any similar episodes of chest pain before. Regular medications include a beta-blocker for her hypertension. She also notes experiencing increased stress and anxiety levels in recent months due to being widowed and moving in with her daughter's family. She is also obese with a BMI of 32kg/m.  Examination:  On examination  she appears distressed and is sweating. Vital signs show blood pressure 160/90 mmHg and a pulse of 110 bpm. Cardiac examination reveals tachycardia but no murmurs. The rest of the examination is normal.  This case can be used to teach medical students about Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  which is often preceded by intense emotional stress and presents similarly to acute coronary syndrome. This is more common in postmenopausal women  especially those with a history of stress or anxiety. The hypertension and obesity of Mrs. Robinson adds more risk to her cardiovascular health. While this condition is more frequently seen in Asian populations  it can affect patients of all ethnic backgrounds  warranting inclusion of a patient representative of the racial and ethnic diversity seen in real world medical practice.   In their assessment of this patient  students should consider the relationship between her emotional stress and her symptoms  the role of her hypertension and obesity in her cardiovascular risk  and the need to differentiate Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy from more common causes of chest pain in the elderly  such as myocardial infarction.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,29,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Information: - 70-year-old female patient - African American - Homemaker  widow  living with her adult son - Former smoker with a history of occasional alcohol use  Past Medical History: - Pre-existing controlled hypertension for the past 10 years - Managed type II diabetes for the past 8 years - Past surgical history noted for appendectomy and cholecystectomy - Menopause at age 52 - No known allergies - Family history of heart disease  Presenting Complaints: The patient presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset chest pain and difficulty breathing. These episodes started earlier in the day and lasted about 20-30 minutes each. The patient described the pain as severe heaviness in the chest  filtering to the left arm. The pain was not associated with meals  exertion or position and did not subside with rest.  She also reported feeling a sense of impending doom and extreme anxiety. She revealed that she had experienced a significant emotional trauma a day prior  with the unexpected loss of a very close friend. The patient denied fever  cough  palpitations  or any other symptoms.  Key Notes: As per literature  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or broken-heart syndrome  is more common in postmenopausal women and often preceded by intense emotional or physical stress. It often mimics symptoms of a heart attack and could present with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. It can lead to serious complications  like heart failure  low blood pressure  heart rhythm disorders  or stroke. Such a patient presentation warrants further investigation with a high index of clinical suspicion for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  given the demographic and stressing event. A well-structured and nuanced approach is crucial in the management of such patients. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,30,Patient Profile: Ms. Abigail Ramirez  a 69-year-old female of Japanese descent  presenting to the emergency department.  Demographics: Ms. Ramirez is a retired school teacher. She lives alone but maintains a socially active lifestyle. She is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol. Her BMI is within the normal range.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Ramirez has a previous clinical history of hypertension controlled with Lisinopril and Amlodipine. She was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  managed with Metformin. She has also had prior episodic symptoms of acid reflux  managed with over-the-counter medication. There is no significant family history of cardiac disease. Her last routine check-up with her primary care was six months ago  with no remarkable findings.  Presenting Complaints: Ms. Ramirez has come into the ER complaining of sudden onset chest pain radiating to her left arm for the past four hours. She describes the pain as severe  gripping in nature  and was preceded by shortness of breath. She also experienced nausea and feelings of apprehension. She notes that these symptoms occurred shortly after learning about the unexpected passing of her close friend  which has caused her significant emotional distress.   This case accurately represents the demographic most likely affected by Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  which is postmenopausal women. It also incorporates the reported trigger of extreme emotional or physical stress. Additionally  it reflects common comorbidities found in Takotsubo patients  such as hypertension and diabetes  though the condition can occur in patients with no history of heart disease.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,31,Case Report  Patient Introduction: Mrs. J is a 68-year-old African American female retired professor who presents to the emergency department (ED).  Presenting Complaint: Reported experiencing intense emotional stress with sudden onset of sharp chest pain  and shortness of breath for the last couple of hours.  Past Medical History: Mrs. J has a past medical history of well-managed hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and migraine headaches. She has a former smoker status with a 20 pack-year history and quit 15 years ago. She admits to rare alcohol consumption and denies drug use. Her only medications include Losartan  Metformin  and occasional Sumatriptan for migraines.  Family History: Her mother died from myocardial infarction at age 74  and her father has well-controlled hypertension. Her only sibling  a brother  was recently diagnosed with heart failure.  Social History: She lives alone and is often visited by her two caring adult children. Recently  she lost her beloved pet dog of 14 years  which has caused her considerable emotional stress.   Discussion: Demographic literature reflects a higher incidence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as 'broken heart syndrome') in post-menopausal women  often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. African American females  such as Mrs. J  are also disproportionately affected by hypertension  which may have a complicating role in the pathophysiology of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The sudden onset of chest pain and breathlessness following a significantly stressful event (pet loss) suggests the possibility of 'broken heart syndrome ' which is a clinical syndrome mimicking acute coronary syndrome in the absence of coronary artery disease.  The patient's symptoms  her age  gender  combined with recent emotional stress and the absence of significant coronary risk factors (like prolonged smoking  high cholesterol  or family history)  increase the suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  although her history of hypertension does increase her risk for coronary artery disease. Thus  a further diagnostic workup  including laboratory investigations (like cardiac Troponin levels) and imaging studies (echo-cardiogram  perhaps followed by coronary angiography)  would be essential in making a definitive diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,32,"Patient Information:   Ms. Kawamura  a 68-year-old Asian female  retired middle-school teacher.   Medical History:  She has a medical history of hypertension which is well controlled through medication. She also has hyperlipidemia but is non-smoker  moderate wine-drinker  and follows a balanced diet. She experienced menopause at age 52. She lives alone and often reports feeling lonely since the death of her husband two years ago.   Key Complaints:  Ms. Kawamura presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm which started roughly an hour ago while she was attending her husband's second death anniversary at a local cemetery. She describes the chest pain as crushing  similar to a heavy weight pressing on her chest. Along with this  she has been sweating excessively and experiencing shortness of breath.  Case Specifics:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome""""  is typically triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. It predominantly affects post-menopausal women  with a higher prevalence seen in those of Asian descent. Key symptoms include chest pain and shortness of breath  mimicking a heart attack. This case reflects these aspects  with a patient who is of an appropriate demographic and experienced an emotional trigger prior to symptom onset.  The case should lead students to consider EKG  cardiac enzymes test  echocardiogram  and eventually  cardiac MRI or angiogram as part of the diagnostic procedure. It should emphasize the importance of a careful and detailed patient interview to identify potential triggers  review symptoms  and rule out other conditions with similar symptoms such as myocardial infarction. Management should focus on relieving the triggering stressor if any  managing symptoms  and often includes heart medications like ACE inhibitors  beta blockers  and diuretics. It should also reiterate that while takotsubo syndrome can lead to serious complications like heart failure  life-threatening arrhythmias  and stroke  the heart often returns to normal within weeks or months with appropriate medical management."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,33,"Case Report:  Patient Information:  A 68-year-old Caucasian female  recently widowed.  Past Medical History:  The patient previously enjoyed good health. She has no history of coronary artery disease  hypertension  diabetes  or any other chronic illnesses. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She takes no daily medications and has no known drug allergies. She does not have a family history of premature heart disease.   Chief Complaints: The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain and discomfort radiating to the left arm  associated with shortness of breath  sweating  nausea  and palpitations. The symptoms started after she heard about the sudden death of her son in a car accident.   Additional Information: Failure to acknowledge or manage the emotional stress after her son's death might have precipitated the symptoms. This diagnosis should be confirmed with an echocardiogram  ECG changes  and exclusion of coronary artery disease.  Rationale:  This exercise is designed to familiarize students with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken-heart syndrome""""  a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Though the exact cause is unclear  it often occurs following severe emotional stress  such as the death of a loved one  a major accident  or serious illness. It is more common in post-menopausal women  and the patient's presentation and past history make this condition a strong diagnostic possibility. Reports suggest that 90% of reported cases are in women aged 58 to 75. This case is designed to provide a real-world example of this medical concept  to improve understanding and diagnostic accuracy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,34,Patient Profile:  Name: Ms. Margaret Smith Age: 67 years old Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Past Medical History:  Ms. Smith has a history of hypertension for which she takes a daily dose of Lisinopril and has been post-menopausal for 15 years. She quit smoking 10 years ago and drinks alcohol socially. She has no personal or familial history of heart diseases.   Chief Complaints: Ms. Smith presented in the Emergency Department with sudden onset chest pain. The chest pain exacerbated in stressful situations and was relieved with rest. She has felt sporadic profuse sweating  had difficulty breathing  and experienced occasional nausea. Additionally  Ms. Smith exhibited symptoms of anxiety and mentioned she has been under tremendous stress due to the recent death of her husband. She rated her chest pains as 8 on a scale of 10 and described it as heaviness centralized in her mid to left chest.  Background Information: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  typically affects post-menopausal women and has a strong association with acute emotional or physiological stress. Clinical symptoms often mimic acute coronary syndrome. Though Margaret's history of hypertension is a risk factor for Acute Coronary Syndrome  her recent bereavement and stress indicate the possibility of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,35,"Subject: Training Case - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Patient's Name: Mrs. A. Smith Gender: Female Age: 70 years Ethnicity: Caucasian Profession: Retired School Teacher Marital Status: Widow Location: Urban  Past Medical History: - Hypertension - 8 years ago  controlled by medication - Type II Diabetes mellitus - diagnosed a year ago  managed by diet and medication - Depression - diagnosed 5 years ago and on medication - No previous history of heart disease  Key Complaints: Presented to the emergency department with: - Acute onset shortness of breath - Complaints of severe chest pain particularly on the left side  similar to having a heart attack (acute coronary syndrome) - Sudden emotional stress following the unexpected death of her dog  Additional Information for Creating the Case Scenario: The reported case should include details to help the students ascertain that Mrs. Smith suffers from Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome) and not a myocardial infarction  despite similar symptoms. The key differentiating factor in literature is high emotional or physical stress which  in this case  is the sudden death of Mrs. Smith's pet. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy occurs more in post-menopausal women and on a higher incidence in individuals who have neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety  which aligns with Mrs. Smith's profile.  Make sure to emphasize the necessary investigations  including coronary angiography and cardiac biomarker levels. While the initial presentation and biomarker levels may suggest an acute myocardial infarction  coronary angiography will help reveal the distinctive pattern of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy that resembles a """"takotsubo""""  a Japanese word for """"fishing pot for trapping octopus""""  which is how the condition got its name. The apex of the left ventricle balloons out  resembling the shape of the pot.   Also emphasize the management and prognosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  that usually involves supportive care and medications such as ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers or diuretics  depending on symptom severity and left ventricular function.   Finally  stress the importance of psychological counselling and stress management techniques as Mrs. Smith also suffers from a history of depression  which might have contributed to the episode of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,36,Case Study: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Presentation:   Ms. Julia  a 68-year-old Asian woman  presented to the emergency department with 2 hours of severe  crushing chest pain. The pain started while she was at a family gathering where she learned of her granddaughter's critical illness. The pain was sudden in onset  continuous  non-radiating and associated with shortness of breath and profuse sweating. She rated it 8 out of 10 on the pain scale. She denied any nausea  vomiting  or palpitations.  Patient Demographics:   Ms. Julia is a retired school teacher  currently living alone after the loss of her husband last year. She has never smoked and only consumes alcohol occasionally. She follows a balanced diet and takes regular walks.   Past Medical History:   Ms. Julia has a history of well-controlled hypertension that she manages with a daily dose of lisinopril. She has no diagnosis of diabetes  dyslipidemia  previous heart disease  or stroke and no known genetic conditions or family history of heart disease. Her BMI is within the healthy range.  Key Complaints:   1. Severe chest pain. 2. Shortness of breath. 3. Profuse sweating.   Note:   This patient's demographics and presentation fit well within the common population affected by takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome - postmenopausal women experiencing a stressful event. Though not limited to this demographic  a higher incidence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been noted in Asian women as well as the demographic described above.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,37,"Case Report: Clinical Training Case: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Details:  Mr. Y is a 68-year-old Asian male with a history of well-managed hypertension and mild osteoarthritis. He has no known allergies and is currently taking amlodipine 5mg daily for blood pressure control.  History of Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Y  who lives alone  presented at the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain of sudden onset  radiating to the left arm  and associated with intense sweating and shortness of breath. The pain appeared an hour after he was informed of his son's sudden accidental death. He specifically described the pain as feeling """"like a heavy load was sitting right on the chest.""""  The patient denied any symptoms of indigestion  cough  or radiation of the pain to jaw or neck. He has never experienced such a symptom before.  Physical exam:  On arrival  Mr. Y appeared distressed and diaphoretic. His BMI was 23 kg/m2. Vitals showed blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg  heart rate 110 bpm  respiratory rate 22 bpm  oxygen saturation 95%.  Cardiovascular examination showed a regular rhythm  tachycardic  without murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Other system examinations were unremarkable.  Diagnostic Insight:  According to literature  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy  is more common in postmenopausal women but can occur in men  especially in periods of intense emotional or physiological stress. Given that our patient experienced intense emotional stress prior to the onset of symptoms  an EKG  cardiac enzymes  and an echocardiogram should be ordered to confirm if Mr. Y is suffering from Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  An EKG might reveal ST-segment elevation  while cardiac enzymes might be moderately elevated. The echocardiogram might show an apical ballooning pattern  a classic sign of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment and Education:  Emergency treatment would aim at relieving the patient's chest pain  normalizing heart rate  and managing blood pressure. This would be followed by a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program. The patient should be educated about the condition  contributing factors  and the importance of stress management.  Conclusion:  This case would provide practical exposure to students about the relationship between intense stress and heart health  inviting discussions on correlations between emotional stress and cardiovascular diseases  differential diagnosis  and effective patient communication. This case also shows the importance of a thorough history and the need to consider nontraditional diagnoses in appropriately selected patients."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,38,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 71-year-old Caucasian female. She is a retired school teacher  widow  and has three children. She does not smoke or drink alcohol and maintains a relatively healthy lifestyle. The patient lives with her daughter and her family  following the loss of her spouse two years prior to the onset of her symptoms. She has a supportive social network  but has mentioned facing emotional stress recently due to financial matters.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which she has been well-managed on Metformin for the past ten years. She also has mild hypertension  controlled with Lisinopril  and hyperlipidemia managed with Simvastatin. Her latest lab results from six months ago show her diabetes and cholesterol levels are under control. There is no family history of heart disease. She has no known allergies.  Key Complaints: The patient presented in the Emergency Department complaining of acute chest pain  radiating to her left arm along with feelings of extreme anxiety. She was initially in the kitchen when an intense argument with her son-in-law regarding financial matters occurred  during which she started to feel the onset of her symptoms. The chest pain was sudden  severe  and was associated with shortness of breath. She had never experienced anything like this before.   Please note: Literature shows that takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is most commonly found in post-menopausal women aged 58-75. Strong emotional stressors often precipitate the onset of symptoms  and patients frequently have a history of neurologic disorders  psychiatric disorders  or cancer  but the phenomenon still happens in individuals without these histories.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,39,Patient Profile: Name: Mrs. Yoko Suzuki Age: 73 Sex: Female Ethnicity: Japanese Occupation: Retired High School Teacher  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Suzuki has a history of hypertension  which is managed with Lisinopril. She has no history of heart disease. She has been relatively healthy in her later years  with occasional bouts of anxiety and stress  for which she attends counselling.  Key Complaints:   Mrs. Suzuki presented at the ER department with severe chest pain that started approximately 1 hour prior to arrival. The pain was sudden in onset  located in the centre of the chest  squeezing in nature  and did not radiate to any part of her body. She also reported feeling extreme anxiety and shortness of breath.   NOTE: This case is designed mainly with regard to extend literature that reports Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is more common in postmenopausal women  especially of Asian descent. The condition is often triggered by severe mental or emotional stress. Hence  the demographics of an elderly Japanese woman with a history of anxiety and stress have been chosen. Also  chest pain and shortness of breath are the common symptoms with which patients present  mimicking a heart attack. The history of hypertension is another common contributing factor for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,40,"Case Report  Patient Profile: Ms. Patricia  a 68-year-old Caucasian retired elementary school teacher and widower  presented to the hospital's emergency room. She is from a suburban area  living alone and maintains an independent lifestyle.  Past Medical History: Her medical history only reveals controlled hypertension  on hydrochlorothiazide for the last five years. No known history of diabetes mellitus  dyslipidemia or smoking. Family history reveals her mother was diabetic  and her father had heart failure in his late sixties. She had no known history of drug allergies.   Key Complaints: Patient was brought into the hospital because suddenly she experienced severe chest pain while attending a friend's funeral  which was similar to a feeling of """"heavy pressure"""" on her chest  and shortness of breath. The pain did not radiate anywhere else and was not relieved by rest. Associated symptoms included mild nausea and lightheadedness. On a scale of 1 to 10  she reported the pain as an 8. She denies any history of palpitations  syncope  or sweating.  Note for Medical Educators: This case is constructed keeping in mind the reported mean age of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and their majority as post-menopausal women  suggesting a role of withdrawal of estrogen. Indeed  a stressful event is often reported before patient presentation and could be identified as a trigger for disease onset. In addition  a certain vulnerability linked to a psychiatric disorders could be important as up to 25% of patients have a previous history of neurologic or psychiatric diseases."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,41,Patient Case:  Name: Mrs. Haruyo Suzuki Age: 68 years  Sex: Female  Race: Asian  Occupation: Retired school teacher   Mrs. Suzuki is a 68-year-old retired school teacher who presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain and feeling of impending doom. The pain is described as heavy  with noticeable shortness of breath. It started approximately three hours prior to her arrival and has been constant since.   She has no known past medical history of heart disease  diabetes  high blood pressure  or high cholesterol. She is not a smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. Her father had a heart attack at the age of 72  and her mother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in her early 60s. She has been going through a stressful period lately due to the recent death of her husband.  During the initial assessment  she was found hyperventilating and sweaty. The pain was not relieved by rest. Her initial EKG showed changes mimicking myocardial infarction. Her cardiac enzymes were surprisingly normal considering the level of pain and EKG changes.   Upon further investigation  her echocardiogram showed an abnormal movement of the left ventricle  with a significant narrowing of the apex during systole and an enlarged base  which is characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Additionally  angiogram showed no blockage in coronary arteries.  This case represents a typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is also known as broken heart syndrome. The medical literature suggests  while the condition can occur at any age  it often affects postmenopausal women who have recently encountered a significant emotional trauma. The condition is often misdiagnosed as a heart attack because symptoms and test results are similar. But unlike a heart attack  there’s no evidence of blocked heart arteries in takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,42,"Case Title: """"Senior Female with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: A Case Study""""  Patient Information:   The patient is Mrs. Jane Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian woman who is a retired school teacher. She lives with her husband in their suburban home.   Past Medical History:  Mrs. Smith has a medical history of well-managed hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol socially. Her most recent lab tests (3 months prior) revealed stable HbA1c  cholesterol levels  and blood pressure readings within the controlled range on medication. She was regular on her prescribed medication (metformin and amlodipine). She has no known allergies. She has a family history of heart disease  with her father dying from a myocardial infarction at age 65.  Presenting Complaints:  Mrs. Smith presented at the Emergency Department with severe chest pain  mimicking acute myocardial infarction  along with sweating and shortness of breath that started a few hours earlier while she was comforting her daughter who had just gone through a major car accident. She was noted to be in apparent emotional distress and appeared hypervigilant and agitated.   On admission  her blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg  heart rate was regular at 110 bpm  temperature was normal  and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.  Context & Evaluation:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""" often presents in post-menopausal women  typically in response to intense emotional or physical stress. Prognosis is generally good  but it is important to differentiate it from more life-threatening conditions like acute coronary syndrome. Treatments usually aim to relieve the stress causing the syndrome and supportive care.   This scenario was assigned to emphasize the importance of considering non-traditional heart disease presentations  highlighting the importance of psycho-social factors in disease presentation  especially in the context of cardiac conditions. Solving this case requires a comprehensive understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiology  the ability to interpret significant signs and symptoms  and the skill to provide compassionate holistic care.   Note: This case is a simplified representation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and is not intended to cover all aspects or complications of the condition. Always rely on the latest clinical guidelines and evidences for best patient care and management plans."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,43,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics: Patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian female  a retired primary school teacher  living alone.  Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension managed with Lisinopril 10mg daily  and occasional migraines. She is a non-smoker and denies alcohol or recreational drug use.  Key Complaints: The patient presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started a few hours ago. The symptoms began following a stressful telephone call in which she learned of her son's sudden death. As she describes it  the chest pain is similar to """"an elephant sitting on my chest""""  radiates down her left arm and is accompanied by a feeling of intense fear. She also reports feeling sweaty and nauseous but denies having a headache  blurred vision  or loss of consciousness. The patient also denies history of similar symptoms in the past.   Justification: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken-heart syndrome """" has been found to primarily affect postmenopausal women  typically in their late 60s to early 70s  and is often triggered by intense physical or emotional stress. According to Mayo Clinic  up to 5% of women evaluated for a heart attack actually have this disorder  which can be life-threatening. Though men and younger people can experience it too  it's most common among older women. This case would provide a realistic scenario for trainees to practice identifying symptoms  proceed with diagnostic procedures  and determine appropriate treatment strategies."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,44,Patient Profile • Age: 67 • Sex: Female • Occupation: Retired teacher • Ethnicity: Caucasian   Past Medical History Mrs. B is a recent widow with a history of well-managed type 2 diabetes and hypertension. She also has a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder  for which she takes fluoxetine. She has no past history of coronary artery disease  tumors  pheochromocytoma  or any rheumatologic diseases. She has a 30-year history of moderate daily alcohol consumption and is a former smoker.  Key Complaints Mrs. B was admitted to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain  radiating to the left arm  with a sudden onset while she was on the phone arguing with her late husband’s insurance company. Along with the chest pain  she also reported difficulty breathing and a feeling of uneasiness. The symptoms were not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.  Family History Both her parents died of non-cardiovascular related diseases. Her older brother was diagnosed with coronary artery disease at the age of 65.  Demographic Representation This case was designed keeping in view the accurate demographic representation as found in literature for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which tends to majorly affect post-menopausal women who have just gone through severe emotional stress. Women are 7-9 times more likely to suffer Takotsubo cardiomyopathy than men. Most patients have a past history of a neuropsychiatric disorder  such as anxiety or depression. This case takes into account the most commonly found demographic - a post menopausal woman who has suffered a recent emotional stressor  with a past medical history of neuropsychiatric disorders.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,45,"CASE REPORT:   PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS: Mrs. Joan Rivers  a 72-year-old Caucasian female  presenting to the emergency department. She is a widow and lives alone in a suburban neighborhood. She is a retired school teacher  a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.   PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Mrs. Rivers is known to have a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both being well managed with long-term medications. She had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder about two years ago after the death of her husband  for which she had been undergoing treatment under a Psychiatry Consultant. She has no known allergies. Family history reveals that her mother had coronary artery disease.  KEY COMPLAINTS: Mrs. Rivers had been brought in by her neighbor who found her in distress. She reports experiencing severe chest pain and shortness of breath for the past few hours before her arrival. The pain had been sudden onset  and she grades it as an 8 on a scale of 10. Additionally  she has been feeling nauseated and also experienced an episode of vomiting while en route to the hospital. In terms of situational context  Mrs. Rivers also lost her pet dog of 10 years very recently  which has further exacerbated her depressive symptoms and caused her significant emotional stress.  (From the literature  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome""""  predominantly affects postmenopausal women (mean age 62-75 years) more than men (9:1 ratio). Major triggers comprise emotional (e.g.  grief  anger  fear  panic) and physical (e.g.  acute asthma  surgery  chemotherapy) stressors.)"
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,46,Patient Demographics: - Gender: Female - Age: 78 - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired school teacher - Marital Status: Widowed  Past Medical History: - Hypertension treated with Lisinopril 10mg daily - Osteoarthritis  - No previous history of cardiovascular disease - No history of diabetes mellitus  stroke  or any malignancies - No known allergies - Family history: Mother died of colon cancer at age 84  father died of coronary heart disease at age 78  two older brothers are alive and well.  Presenting Problems: Patient presents to the emergency room with acute onset of chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  which started suddenly early in the morning. The chest pain is described as intense and radiating to the back  not related to exertion or stress. Symptoms started approximately two hours before arrival in the ER.   Supporting Information: - The patient's husband recently passed away  which has led to significant emotional stress in the past two months. - On examination  she appears anxious but not in acute distress. Her blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg  pulse is 100 beats/minute  and respiratory rate is 20 breaths/minute. - An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads.  - Lab findings showed a slightly elevated troponin level.   This training case is suitable to teach the concept of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome'  as it typically affects post-menopausal women and can be precipitated by severe stress. The patient's symptoms  ECG changes  and mildly elevated troponin may suggest an initial diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS)  however  given the patient's recent history of significant emotional stress and the absence of significant risk factors for coronary artery disease  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy should be strongly considered.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,47,"Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Name: Mrs. Y Age: 69 Sex: Female Race/Ethnicity: Asian Occupation: Retired teacher  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Y has no significant past medical history. She has never smoked and is not known to have any chronic conditions. She does not take any regular medications. She has no allergies and does not have a history of any mental health illness or substance use disorder. Her family history is negative for cardiac diseases. She lives on her own in an urban area and has a strong social support from friends and neighbors.  Presenting Complaints:  Mrs. Y presents to the emergency department with sharp retrosternal chest pain which started suddenly while she was attending a funeral. The pain was sudden in onset  was severe  felt like """"something was squeezing her chest""""  and was associated with shortness of breath. There was no radiation of pain  no associated vomiting or loss of consciousness. Basically  no typical cardiovascular or pulmonary symptoms except for sudden chest pain and dyspnea.   Note: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a transient heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations  such as the death of a loved one. The condition involves a temporary disruption of the heart's normal pumping function in one area of the heart. The remainder of the heart functions normally or with even more forceful contractions. Most often  it occurs in post-menopausal women. This diagnosis should be considered when a patient presents with an acute myocardial infarction-like (heart attack) clinical picture  but has no evident coronary artery disease. A case like this would enable students to understand the implications of emotional stress on the heart  demonstrating that heart diseases are not always due to physiological trigger factors but can also be of psychological origin."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,48,"Case Report:   Patient Information:    The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female. She is a retired school teacher who lives independently in a suburban area. She has been widowed for the last 3 years and has two grown-up children  both living out of state. Her BMI is 26. She does not smoke or drink alcohol.  Past Medical History:   The patient is generally in good health for her age. She has a controlled case of hypertension which she manages with daily doses of Lisinopril. She also has a history of mild osteoporosis for which she takes calcium supplements and does regular weight-bearing exercises. She has no known allergies.  Chief Complaints:    The patient presents to the Emergency Department with sudden  severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She denies any difficulty in swallowing  nausea  numbness  or tingling in the extremities. She describes the chest pain as a crushing sensation  similar to “an elephant sitting on my chest.”   She reports that the pain started suddenly while she was hearing news about her only brother's unexpected death. She also admits that she has been under significant emotional stress for the past few days given the circumstance.  Rationale:   This case has been selected considering that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as """"Broken Heart Syndrome """" often presents in postmenopausal women with a recent history of severe emotional stress. TTC presents similarly to acute coronary syndrome with symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath. Moreover  this case emphasizes the importance of understanding the impact of emotional stressors on physical health and their relevance in diagnosis."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,49,"Patient Case:  Patient Information: Ms. Matilda Evans  a 71-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher  widowed  living alone. She has been generally fit and healthy most of her life  with no significant past medical history. Her BMI is within a healthy range  and she is a non-smoker.  Presenting Complaints: Matilda presented to the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain  characterized as """"crushing"""" pain that radiated to her left arm. Accompanied by shortness of breath  and palpitations  these symptoms began shortly after she received news about her son's sudden death in a car accident earlier in the day.  Past Medical History: Matilda has been a generally healthy individual with no chronic medical illnesses. She does not have any history of cardiac diseases  hypertension  diabetes  or hypercholesterolemia. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She used to be physically active most of her life but reduced this due to her knee arthritis for the last 2 years. She has no known drug allergies and does not take any medications regularly.  Family History: Matilda's mother had been diagnosed with Breast cancer at the age of 78  but no known heart diseases are evident in her family.  These demographics are consistent with the fact that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  has a greater incidence in postmenopausal women and can be triggered by severe stress. The case described above would be intended to help medical students understand and identify the key features of this disorder  including patient demographics  precipitating factors  symptoms  and the contrasting lack of traditional cardiovascular risk factors."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,50,"Patient Case:  Patient Profile: Gender: Female Age: 68 years old Race/Ethnicity: Japanese Occupation: Retired  Past Medical History: - Non-smoker - Occasional alcohol consumption  - No history of drug addiction - No allergies - No significant family history of heart disease - Suffers from hypertension controlled with antihypertensive therapy - History of major depressive disorder controlled with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)  Key Complaints: The patient reported intensified chest pain  sudden onset  similar to the feeling of """"an elephant sitting on her chest"""" following an emotional stressor. She also reported shortness of breath  nausea  and lightheadedness.   These symptoms initiated after she received news about the death of a close friend  which was extremely distressing for her. The symptoms weren't relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.  Background: This case is designed according to the demographics commonly found in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome). This mostly affects postmenopausal women and often occurs following a severe emotional stressor. The patient demographics and history have been accurately represented following the clinical features detailed in various literature on the disease. The patient's symptoms show similarities to those observed in acute coronary syndrome  fostering the learning objective of distinguishing between the two conditions."

She is a retired nurse and lives alone. Mrs. H has two children  but they live in another city. She displays high involvement in her local community's social events.  Past Medical History: Mrs. H has a substantial medical history- she was diagnosed with well-controlled type II diabetes mellitus about six years ago and she also has hypertension  under control with lifestyle modifications and regular medication. She sustained a minor stroke around two years ago but was able to recover without any long-lasting sequelae. A year ago  Mrs. H was treated for mild depression associated with the loss of her husband. She is non-smoker and seldom drinks alcohol.  Key Complaints: Mrs. H came to the emergency department with a complaint of acute chest discomfort that lets for 20 minutes and abrupt onset of dyspnea that started this morning. She reports the chest pain to be severe  similar to a 'pressure' or 'tight' sensation  radiating from her chest to her left arm and neck. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath  excessive sweating  nausea  and light-headedness. She also states that she's been feeling emotionally stressed after her son and daughter-in-law announced their divorce  creating familial tension.  This case was specifically designed to exhibit the primary characteristics of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". The disease often has a significant psychological stressor as a trigger and is more common in postmenopausal women. Despite presenting with symptoms similar to acute coronary syndrome  patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy have often relatively healthy coronary arteries. The next section of this case will move into further necessary investigations  diagnosis  treatment  and management."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,52,"Case Study: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman  Patient Information: Age: 71 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Presenting Complaints: The patient presents to the Emergency Department with recent-onset chest pain and shortness of breath. She reports the onset of symptoms occurred simultaneously two hours ago without any precipitating factors or particular circumstances. The pain is not radiating and is described as a heaviness in the chest. She also reported mild nausea but no diaphoresis or dizziness.  Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension  which has been controlled with thiazide diuretics for more than a decade. She is a non-smoker and denies any history of drug abuse. She does not have any known history of coronary artery disease  diabetes  asthma  or COPD. The review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.  Psychosocial Background: She is divorced  living alone  and her two children live out of state. She lost her mother six months ago and has been experiencing episodes of emotional stress since then. She mentions feeling isolated and lonely much of the time.  This case study was designed to reflect the demographic and clinical presentation typically associated with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. According to literature  the median age of presentation is 67-75 years  and it is notably more common in postmenopausal women. Considered a form of acute heart failure  it is often associated with severe emotional or physical stress  hence it is also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". Studies also showed that although the etiology is unknown  individuals with a history of neurologic or psychiatric illness appear to be at increased risk. In this patient  the recent bereavement and consequent isolation pose as considerable emotional stressors. Despite its dramatic presentation  most patients enjoy a good prognosis with appropriate treatment and support."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,53,Case Report  Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Misdiagnosed as Stress-Induced Acute Coronary Syndrome   Patient Background: Mrs. Margaret Thompson  a 74-year-old Caucasian woman  presents to the emergency department (ED). She is a widow who resides in a senior assisted living community. Mrs. Thompson has a well-documented history of hypertension and acute anxiety disorder for which she takes amlodipine 5mg daily and as-needed lorazepam respectively. She is a non-smoker and has no family history of heart disease or high alcohol consumption.   Chief Complaints: Mrs. Thompson came to the ED complaining of severe chest pain that began earlier in the day. She reports she feels a heaviness in the chest  along with other classic symptoms of cardiac distress such as nausea  shortness of breath  and lightheadedness. She mentioned that her symptoms started shortly after receiving news about the sudden death of a close friend.   Diagnostic Dilemma:  Mrs. Thompson's symptoms  considered alongside her age  make an initial diagnosis of a myocardial infarction a reasonable and prudent conclusion. However  her medical history of acute anxiety disorder and the recent emotional trauma she experienced suggests that takotsubo cardiomyopathy could be a potential and less obvious diagnosis.   Discussion Topic:  This case offers a valuable learning opportunity for medical students to explore the nuances of correct diagnosis and treatment in older patients with complex medical histories. It also brings attention to Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  a relatively under-recognized condition  commonly misdiagnosed as acute coronary syndrome  that commonly affects postmenopausal women  particularly in periods of intense emotional or physical stress.  Educational Objectives:  1. Understand the typical demographic and circumstantial presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 2. Distinguish between takotsubo cardiomyopathy and acute coronary syndrome based on a patient's presentation and medical history. 3. Determine what type of diagnostic tests would be most beneficial in patients presenting with suspected takotsubo cardiomyopathy (i.e. echocardiogram  coronary angiogram). 4. Discuss the importance of taking into account patient's psychological stressors during the diagnostic process. 5. Develop correct management and follow-up strategy for patients diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Key Complaints:  • Patient presents with acute onset of severe chest pain. • She describes the pain as a """"heavy feeling"""" similar to someone sitting on her chest. • Associated with the chest pain  the patient reports experiencing shortness of breath  palpitations  and nausea for the past few hours. • She also reports she has been under significant stress due to the recent passing of her husband. • Denies any history of smoking  alcohol  or drug use.  Rationale:  The chosen demographics are a reflection of typical patient profiles for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". TCM overwhelmingly affects postmenopausal women and the development of the condition is often linked to stressful events. Importantly  the symptoms of TCM  including chest pain and shortness of breath  often mimic those of a heart attack and should  therefore  be taken very seriously. TCM can be a fatal condition if not treated promptly and properly. As such  it's crucial that medical students are well-versed in recognizing the clinical presentation of TCM and differentiating it from other potential diagnoses. Given the patient's presentation and history  a suspicion of TCM should be raised and appropriate diagnostic steps should be considered.   This case provides an opportunity for medical students to explore the pathophysiology  evaluation  and management of TCM  while also emphasizing the importance of obtaining a comprehensive history and examining the interplay of physical health with psychological stressors."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,55,"Patient Information:  Mrs. R is a 71-year-old Asian woman living in the suburbs  married with three adult children. She is a homemaker and enjoys gardening as well as cooking for her family.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. R has been managing her Type II diabetes for the past ten years with diet and oral medication (Metformin). She has a history of hypertension  chronic kidney disease (stage 2)  and osteoporosis. She underwent a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis three years ago. She is a non-smoker and drinker.  Key Complaints:  Mrs. R presents to the emergency department (ED) complaining of sudden onset chest pain radiating down her left arm for the past hour  associated with shortness of breath and a feeling of impending doom. She denies any recent trauma  weight loss  fever  or cough. Both parents died of stroke  and her younger brother had a myocardial infarction at a relatively young age (54 years old). Considering her age  underlying conditions and the nature of her symptoms  the medical team in the ED is concerned about acute coronary syndrome  but due to her significant emotional stress after the death of her beloved pet  a physician suggests takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""".  Rationale:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a condition characterized by temporary heart dysfunction  often as a result of severe emotional or physical stress. The condition is also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""" because it has been linked to severe emotional trauma such as intense grief  fear  or anger. The clinical presentation  particularly chest pain and shortness of breath  closely mimics that of an acute coronary syndrome  but there is often no evidence of obstructive coronary disease.  This condition predominantly affects postmenopausal women and they are often older than 50 years of age. Ethnicity is rarely specified in cases  making broad demographic representation difficult  but some studies suggest an increased prevalence amongst Asians. Moreover  the inclusion of diabetes and hypertension in the patient's history aligns with the high prevalence of these comorbidities in real-life datasets of takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients.  This case is meant for medical students to practice recognizing the clinical features of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  considering the diagnosis  and initiating early management. The case also highlights the need for health professionals to consider the interplay between physiological and psychosocial factors in disease manifestation and progression."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,56,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Information:  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian female  retired  who came to the emergency department accompanied by her daughter. The patient is a widow and lives with her daughter and her family.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  for which she takes prescribed medication daily. She has no known allergies. She does not smoke  drinks occasionally  and has no known history of drug abuse. She has no history of cardiac disease  diabetes  or any other major illnesses. Her family history has a notable presence of cardiac diseases  with her late husband having died of myocardial infarction.  Presenting Complaints: The patient reports to have been experiencing severe chest pain for the past few hours  along with shortness of breath. She also mentioned feeling extremely stressed in the past few days due to a recent family conflict. On observation  the patient appeared anxious and mildly disoriented  with visible signs of discomfort and distress.  Note:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome  predominantly affects postmenopausal women. The exact cause is unknown but is often triggered by severe emotional distress  such as the death of a loved one. The major symptoms include chest pain and shortness of breath  mimicking those of a heart attack. The typical patient is a post-menopausal woman who has suffered a recent severe emotional event. The case study reflects the typical demographic and emotional trigger generally seen in patients diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,57,Patient Profile:   Name: Jane Doe Age: 70 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: White Profession: Retired School Teacher  Presenting Complaint: Patient presents to the emergency department with new onset severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  which started a few hours ago while attending her husband's funeral.  Past Medical History: Previously diagnosed with anxiety and hypertension under control with medication. She has had a very stressful period recently due to personal reasons but reports no history of heart disease  diabetes  substance use  or previous chest pain episodes.  Social History:  The patient is a widow who lives with her daughter and two grandchildren. She has recently suffered the loss of her spouse  which has caused a significant amount of distress.  Exam: Vital signs are stable but demonstrate a slight tachycardia (heart rate around 110 bpm). The physical exam is unremarkable  with normal heart sounds and no pulmonary abnormalities.  Clinical Course: Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads with a significantly elevated Troponin level. Coronary angiography reveals no significant obstruction of the coronary arteries  suggesting a non-ischemic cardiac pathology.   Given the lack of coronary occlusion and the recent emotional stress  the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'  secondary to severe emotional stress.   Learning Points: 1. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy typically presents as chest pain similar to acute myocardial infarction  yet lacks a coronary artery obstruction. Echocardiography often demonstrates characteristic left ventricular abnormalities. 2. This condition predominantly affects postmenopausal women  and is frequently associated with recent intense physical or emotional stress. 3. Prognosis is generally better than an acute coronary syndrome  with most patients experiencing complete recovery with supportive care and control of heart failure symptoms. 4. Careful history taking can unravel underlying stressors and guide the diagnosis towards takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,58,"Case Study:  Patient Information: Mrs. Anna Thomas is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  recently widowed  who presented at the outpatient cardiology clinic.   Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension controlled by medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily) and a non-smoker. She has a BMI of 27  with no known history of heart disease  diabetes  or hyperlipidemia. She has recently suffered bereavement  which caused significant psychological stress.   Chief Complaints: Mrs. Thomas has been experiencing sudden onset chest pain resembling a heart attack since the last two days. Along with chest pain  the patient also complains of shortness of breath  palpitations  and generalized fatigue. She experienced these symptoms shortly after her husband's funeral and initially attributed it to her grief.  Ranking these complaints in order of clinical significance  chest pain would be the most concerning  followed by breathlessness and palpitations. These are all symptoms commonly associated with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Note: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy predominantly affects postmenopausal women and can often be triggered by severe emotional stress  commonly known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". This disease involves abrupt transient systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction  and it is not uncommon for symptoms to resemble those of an acute coronary syndrome. It's important to educate students about the necessity of differentiating between acute coronary syndrome and takotsubo cardiomyopathy  as both require different treatment approaches."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,59,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information: - Patient Initials: M.B. - Age: 75 - Sex: Female - Race: White (considering the highest prevalence in Caucasian postmenopausal women) - Occupation: Retired school teacher  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  well controlled with medication. She is otherwise generally healthy  with few other known significant past illnesses. Patient is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol in moderation. No previous heart disease or acute coronary syndrome reported. She also suffers from chronic anxiety.  Presenting Complaint: Patient arrived at the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset chest pain  similar to angina pectoris  and severe shortness of breath  occurring at rest. This episode occurred a few hours after she received news about her daughter's car accident. Pain portrayed as severe  tight  crushing and radiating to the left arm and jaw. The event duration was of about 3 hours before hospital admission.   Other key points to monitor throughout the case report: - Electrocardiogram (ECG): Transient ST-segment elevation suggestive of increased cardiovascular risk and non-specific T wave changes. - Cardiac markers (Troponin levels): Elevation indicative of myocardial injury. - Chest X-Ray: Normal cardiac silhouette and no signs of pulmonary congestion or any other abnormalities. - Echocardiogram: Left ventricular dysfunction (ballooning) with preserved basal function. - Coronary angiogram: No significant coronary artery disease (essential to exclude acute coronary syndrome). - Psychosocial factors: Recent severe emotional stress (bereavement  financial problems  sudden shocking news). - Eventually  normalization of ventricular function on repeat imaging after a few weeks (typical of takotsubo cardiomyopathy).   This case can allow medical students to better understand the disease presentation  importance of history taking  differentiating it from acute coronary syndrome  the role of imaging and recognizing psychological factors as potential triggering conditions. With this case  students are also expected to learn about the management and potential complications of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,60,Case Report:  **Patient Demographics:** 65-year-old Caucasian female  employed as a high school teacher  married with two adult children. She resides in a suburban area and has a history of smoking  quit 28 years ago. The patient describes herself as quite stressed due to recent work issues and financial struggles. She admits she only occasionally exercises  but is otherwise very active at work and home.  **Past Medical History:** The patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a past episode of major depressive disorder  currently under remission. She has been taking Losartan 50mg once daily and Simvastatin 20mg once daily for the last 8 years. Her depression was effectively managed with Sertraline  which she discontinued 4 years ago upon physician's advice. No known allergies have been reported. Her parents are both alive; father with a history of MI at the age of 72 and mother with osteoarthritis. The patient's last comprehensive screening was 3 years ago  and all findings were within normal ranges.  **Chief Complaint:** Presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with the sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. She described the pain as “crushing” in nature  a 9/10 in severity  persisting for the past 3 hours. She also reported feeling lightheaded  sweating profusely  breathless but denied nausea or vomiting. The patient stated she first noticed the pain while having an argument with her husband  which she felt escalated the tension leading to her acute distress.  **Note:** The chosen demographics of a post-menopausal Caucasian woman experiencing high levels of stress is consistent with typical risk profiles for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM)  sometimes referred to as 'Broken Heart Syndrome'. TCM is frequently observed in post-menopausal women  and stressful or emotional triggers are common precursors. The patient's prior medical history of cardiovascular-implicated conditions also support the possibility of this diagnosis.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,61,"Patient Information: 75-year-old Caucasian female  Presenting Complaints: Severe chest pain  difficulty breathing  slight confusion  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She is post-menopausal and has been on hormone replacement therapy for the past 15 years. She reports occasional alcohol use but quit smoking 10 years ago. She was recently widowed 4 months ago and reports to have been under substantial emotional stress since her husband's passing.  Social History: The patient is a retired school teacher. She lives alone and is visited by her daughter on weekends. She has a history of occasional anxiety  for which she takes low dose alprazolam as needed.  Review of Systems: Patient reports a sudden onset of chest pain that felt similar to a """"heavy weight"""" and difficulty in breathing. She also reports some confusion and restlessness  with no history of fainting.  Case Description: The patient presents to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain and difficulty breathing. She reports the symptoms began suddenly while she was watching a television program. Her daughter brought her to the hospital due to concerns of a potential heart attack  especially considering her recent bereavement. Examination reveals her vital signs are stable but her heart rate is slightly elevated. The initial EKG shows changes mimicking an acute coronary syndrome  causing the treating team to suspect a heart attack. However  coronary angiogram shows no significant blockages in her coronary arteries. An echocardiogram reveals characteristic apical ballooning of the left ventricle  supporting a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as Broken Heart Syndrome).  Discussion: This case is designed to illustrate a typical presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition more commonly found in post-menopausal women and often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. It gets its name (literally meaning """"octopus trap"""") from the shape of the heart on imaging  which resembles a pot used to trap octopuses in Japan. Although this condition can mimic a heart attack  it does not involve blockages in the coronary arteries and can be distinguished from a heart attack with an angiogram. Given the patient's recent severe emotional stress and characteristic imaging findings  a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is likely. This case emphasizes the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis for acute chest pain  particularly in older women with recent significant emotional stress."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,62,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Demographics: Name: Mrs. Jean-Paul Age: 67 Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension treated with ACE inhibitors 2. History of generalized anxiety disorder  on escitalopram 3. No history of diabetes or other chronic illness 4. Non-smoker  occasional alcohol consumption 5. No family history of cardiac disease  Presenting Complaints: Jean  a 67-year-old retired school teacher  presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain that started about 2 hours ago. She describes it as a """"crushing"""" pain in the center of her chest  radiating to the left arm. She also reports feeling unusually short of breath.  The chest pain started shortly after she received a call informing her of the sudden death of her brother  with whom she was extremely close. This event significantly distresses her  causing her to feel overwhelming sadness and anxiety.  Clinical Note: This fictitious case presentation is aimed to guide medical students through the diagnostic process of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as 'broken-heart syndrome.' TTC often has demographic predisposition towards postmenopausal women and may be triggered by severe emotional stress. The key symptoms are typically chest pain and shortness of breath  similar to an acute coronary syndrome."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,63,"Patient Profile: Name: Mrs. Patricia K. Age: 68 Sex: Female  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired school teacher   Past Medical History:  Mrs. K has a past medical history of hypertension and Type II diabetes mellitus. She also dealt with several instances of major depression following her husband's death two years ago. Currently  she is not taking any regular medications other than her insulin and antihypertensive drugs. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.   Chief Complaints: Over the last 24-48 hours  Mrs. K has been experiencing severe chest pain that radiates to her left arm  coupled with episodes of shortness of breath. She rates her pain as a ’7’ on a 10-point pain scale. Her symptoms started suddenly during her husband's second death anniversary  during which she reported feeling extreme emotional distress.   Background:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken-heart syndrome """" frequently occurs in postmenopausal women following a severe emotional stressor. It mimics the symptoms of acute coronary syndrome but usually is not caused by blocked coronary arteries. This disorder affects women to men at an approximate ratio of 9:1; with most patients being post-menopausal women in their 60s and 70s. Therefore  Mrs. K's demographics and emotional stress coincide with the typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  This case will thus serve as a good example for training medical students on how to diagnose and manage takotsubo cardiomyopathy. They must also understand the importance of the patient's emotional state as it can trigger certain cardiovascular conditions  highlighting the significance of holistic patient care."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,64,Case Presentation:  Patient Information: A 68-year-old Caucasian female  Past Medical History: The patient has been generally healthy with only the history of hyperlipidemia  managed with diet and exercise. She is a social drinker and a non-smoker.  Presentation: The patient presents to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath that started a few hours ago during a stressful family gathering. The pain is a central crushing sensation with radiation to the left arm. She is also complaining of nausea and light-headedness  but has no history of syncope. There are no exacerbating or relieving factors noted.  Based on global epidemiology  takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more common in postmenopausal women with a prevalence of around 90% with an average age presentation of 67 years. It is often triggered by an intense emotional or physical stress event. The patient's symptoms  history of current stress  age  and sex make takotsubo cardiomyopathy a likely differential diagnosis.  Next steps in the hypothetical training case would include the physical examination  investigations including ECG  cardiac biomarkers  chest X-ray and echocardiography  as well as management strategies fitting for both ACS and takotsubo cardiomyopathy until the diagnosis is made. At last  confirmatory diagnostic workup with coronary angiography and left ventriculogram would be indicated for a final diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  This framed case will help trainees understand the importance of considering varied differentials  especially when classic symptomatology may lead one towards more common scenarios (such as acute coronary syndrome) and missing out on less typical ones like takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It will also help to highlight the role stress plays in our cardiac health.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,65,Patient Information and Presenting Complaint:  Mrs. G  a 78-year-old Caucasian female  presents to the ED with sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath following the unexpected death of her eldest son the day before.   Past Medical History:  The patient’s medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension on Lisinopril  mild osteoarthritic changes in her knees  and hypothyroidism on Levothyroxine. She has not previously been diagnosed with any sort of heart disease. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She lives with her husband  has four adult children  and she recently retired from being an elementary school teacher. She has been experiencing stress and anxiety after hearing the news about her son's demise.  Key Symptoms:  The acute onset of her symptoms mimics those of a heart attack  yet her relatively ordinary past cardiac history and specifically stressful circumstances preceding the attack make it highly possible that she may have takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The atypical chest pain combined with emotional trauma form the key signs for potential takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Mrs. G has been wrestle with emotional bouts of stress and anxiety following the incident which could have precipitated her symptoms. As per recent studies  it is primarily post-menopausal Caucasian females who have been found to be at the highest risk for takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often triggered by severe emotional stress.  Investigations to consider:  An ECG should be promptly performed to rule out the possibilities of an acute myocardial infarction. Troponin levels could be measured to see if they are elevated which would be indicative of heart muscle stress. An echocardiogram or possibly a left ventriculogram could confirm the suspicions of takotsubo cardiomyopathy by displaying the wall motion abnormalities characteristic of the condition. Coronary angiography could rule out atherosclerotic disease. Additionally  further assessments like chest radiograph  full blood count  electrolytes  and thyroid function tests could be performed to rule out differential diagnoses.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,66,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:  70-year-old Caucasian female  retired high school teacher  living independently. No history of smoking or alcohol abuse. No travel history or recent exposures to illness.  Past Medical History:  Has a documented history of hypertension controlled with Amlodipine  diagnosed ten years ago. Her medical history also includes Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus controlled with Metformin diagnosed 8 years ago and hypothyroidism treated with Levothyroxine for the past 5 years. Last routine labs were done six months ago and were normal. She had an annual cardiologist consult due to a family history of heart disease  with no significant findings on her last echocardiogram a year ago.   Key Complaints:  The patient was brought in by her daughter who found her feeling weak and breathless at home. The patient reported experiencing severe emotional distress after the sudden death of her sibling a day prior. The patient complains of sudden onset chest pain radiating to the left arm  associated with shortness of breath  palpitations  and a feeling of impending doom  resembling symptoms akin to a heart attack. She denies any gastrointestinal symptoms  sweating  or loss of consciousness.  Note: Case focuses on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy also known as Broken Heart Syndrome  a condition mainly observed in post-menopausal women  often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. The lack of classic risk factors for coronary artery disease in this present case draws focus on the potential role the patient's severe emotional distress may have in her current presentation. Her presenting symptoms strongly simulate an acute coronary syndrome  which is a common feature of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. This case should encourage students to not only consider epidemiological/demographic factors but also to understand the broad differential diagnoses for chest pain  to recognize Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  and to learn about the impacts of psychological factors on cardiovascular health.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,67,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Demographics: Ms. Y is a 68-year-old Asian female. She is a retired high school teacher  widowed for three years now  and lives alone in New York City.   Past Medical History: Ms. Y has a past medical history of hypertension and depression. However  both conditions have been well managed through a combination of medication and regular check-ups. She quit smoking about 12 years ago and currently doesn't consume alcohol. Her family history is notable for ischemic heart disease  with her late husband passing away due to a myocardial infarction.  Key Complaints: Ms. Y presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with chest tightness and shortness of breath  which started abruptly about two hours prior to her arrival. She noted these symptoms occurring after she received distressing news about her daughter's unexpected health complication.   The chest pain radiates to the shoulder  is a 7 on a 10-point scale  and is not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Her blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg and heart rate 110 bpm. An initial ECG test demonstrated ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V5. The physicians immediately suspected an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); however  percutaneous coronary intervention showed no significant coronary artery disease. Despite this  her left ventriculography depicted apical ballooning suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She was managed using conservative measures and provided with psychological support considering her emotional turmoil  which is believed to have precipitated the episode.  Note:  It's beneficial to use this case to educate students about the """"broken heart syndrome"""" or takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Research suggests that older females  particularly postmenopausal women  are disproportionately affected by this condition. Additionally  a strong link between emotional stressors and the onset of the disease has also been established. This case can also discuss the importance of distinguishing between takotsubo cardiomyopathy and acute coronary syndromes  given that they present similarly but have vastly different management strategies."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,68,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken-Heart Syndrome)  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Sims  a 68-year-old African-American male  retired postal worker  married with two adult children. He is a non-smoker and non-drinker. His body mass index (BMI) is 27.2. The patient lives in a suburban area with his wife.   Past Medical History: Mr. Sims has a history of controlled hypertension  is pre-diabetic with no history of coronary artery disease. He also suffers from moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from second-hand smoke exposure at his workplace. He is currently on Metformin for prediabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and inhaled corticosteroids for COPD. He is under regular follow-ups and reports compliance with medications and regular exercise. He does not have any psychological or psychiatric disorder  but does report occasional bouts of stress  especially post-retirement.  Key Complaints: Mr. Sims presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to his left arm  which was associated with shortness of breath. These symptoms started two hours ago after receiving the news of the sudden death of a close friend. He had no associated nausea  vomiting or diaphoresis.   Conclusion: The patient’s sudden chest pain and shortness of breath in the context of long-standing  managed hypertension  and severe emotional stress  make Mr. Sims a likely case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or “broken-heart syndrome”. Although more common in post-menopausal women  takotsubo cardiomyopathy can affect men  especially those with a similar medical history as Mr. Sims. This is an acute and transient form of heart disease that mimics a heart attack and is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. This case emphasizes the importance of considering varied diagnoses when a patient presents with acute chest pain  and the need to take a thorough medical and personal history from patients in these circumstances.   [It's important to note that takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a clinical diagnosis and requires confirmation by imaging and lab tests to exclude acute coronary syndrome or other causes of the patient's symptoms.]
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,69,"Case Description for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy:  Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. A Age: 72 Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired kindergarten teacher. Lifestyle: Non-smoker  occasional alcohol consumer.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. A has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both being managed with medication for the past ten years. She also has a history of mild anxiety disorder  treated with therapy. She has mentioned occasional non-cardiac chest discomfort in recent years  but has never complained of chest pain.   Patient's Key Complaints:  Mrs. A has been brought to the emergency department by her daughter following a sudden onset of severe chest pain  which started after she received news of her youngest son being severely injured in a car accident. The pain is described as severe  8 on a scale of 1 to 10  sharp  and located sub-sternally. This is accompanied by severe dyspnea and mild nausea. The patient denies having any palpitations  syncope  or loss of consciousness prior to or following the onset of her symptoms.  Discussion:  Given her age  gender  sudden emotional stress  and absence of a history of angina or myocardial infarction  Mrs. A's case is representative of typical takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as """"broken-heart syndrome"""" or """"stress cardiomyopathy."""" TCM disproportionately affects postmenopausal women and can mimic acute coronary syndrome. It often occurs following sudden emotional or physical stress. Dyspnea and chest pain are the most common presenting symptoms.   With this case  medical students will be prompted to delve into a differential diagnosis that includes TCM  Acute Coronary Syndrome  PE  Aortic dissection  etc. This case will also serve as an opportunity to discuss the diagnostic criteria  management  and prognosis of TCM."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,70,Case Report Design: Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:   Name: Mrs. Marjorie  Age: 65 years old Gender: Female Ethnic Background: Caucasian  Past Medical History:   Mrs. Marjorie has a history of hypertension managed with Lisinopril 10mg daily  type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with Metformin  and hyperlipidemia  controlled with Atorvastatin. Other than these conditions  she has previously been a relatively healthy individual with no history of drug or alcohol abuse.   Recent Events:   Recently  two weeks ago  Mrs. Marjorie suffered the sudden loss of her spouse. Following this emotional trauma  she reported feeling significant distress. She attended a routine check-up with her general practitioner  complaining of feeling quite unwell.  Presenting Complaints:   Mrs. Marjorie reports feeling chest tightness and pain  similar sensation to the heavy stone resting on her chest. She also mentioned shortness of breath  fatigue  and a notable drop in her energy levels since her husband's sudden death. She has sporadic bouts of extreme anxiety and lightheadedness  with feelings of impending doom.  These symptoms were initially assessed as part of her grief reaction until she started developing symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. Owing to Mrs. Marjorie's age  past medical history  and the presence of sudden significant emotional stress alongside symptoms mimicking acute myocardial infarction  the clinician suspects the possibility of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome.   In light of her complaints and their possible implications  especially for her heart  Mrs. Marjorie was immediately referred to cardiology.   This case report has been designed keeping in mind the common demographic and clinical characteristics of takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients as reflected in medical literature. The majority of affected individuals are postmenopausal women  and the onset often follows a severe emotional stressor. Symptom presentation often mimics acute coronary syndrome.   It is necessary for the trainees to understand the importance of integrating knowledge of the patient's emotional state and medical history into their approach to diagnosis and management. This case presents an excellent opportunity to discuss the pathophysiology  clinical hallmarks  diagnosis  and management of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,71,"Patient Information:  Patient: 67-year-old woman Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Controlled with medication for the past 5 years. 2. Hyperlipidemia: Managed with statins. 3. No personal history of heart disease or stroke. 4. Family history of heart disease.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient was brought to the ED by her daughter after complaining of sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to her left shoulder  which started a couple of hours after getting news of her eldest son's sudden passing.  Clinical Examination:  On presentation  she was anxious  pain reported 8/10  heart rate 110 bpm  BP 145/95 mmHg  Oxygen saturation 97%  and respiration rate 18 breaths/min.  Case Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""" and is often triggered by severe stress. It simulates symptoms of a heart attack  such as chest pain and shortness of breath  but unlike a heart attack  there's no evidence of blocked heart arteries in takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It predominantly affects postmenopausal women.  In this case  our patient is a postmenopausal woman who experienced severe emotional stress  in this case  the sudden demise of her son  followed by acute chest pain. Given her demographic and clinical presentation  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a top differential diagnosis  although acute myocardial infarction should also be ruled out due to patient's age and risk factors (hypertension  hyperlipidemia  family history of heart disease).  An urgent ECG  cardiac biomarkers  and an echocardiogram should be organized. Further management should be carried out according to the results of these investigations. These steps would eventually lead to the diagnosis and confirmation of the syndrome  thus providing medical students with an engaging training case on Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,72,"Case Study: Broken Heart Syndrome (Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy)  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old  Japanese  postmenopausal woman with an average demographic profile typical of those diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She lives alone  is a widow and recently retired from her job as a primary school teacher. She does not smoke and drinks socially on occasions. She lives a moderately active lifestyle with regular light exercise and a well-balanced diet.  Past Medical History: The patient has a controlled history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension  managed with daily atorvastatin and a combination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide  respectively  for the past 10 years. She has also had previous episodes of depression following her husband's death five years ago. There have been no previous cardiac symptoms or issues recorded in her medical history.  Complaint: The patient was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) following an episode of acute chest pain  dyspnea (shortness of breath)  and palpitations which started suddenly while she was dealing with some stressful legal documents related to her retirement benefits. She describes the pain as similar to a """"heavy weight on her chest” which did not radiate to other parts of her body.  Further assessment showed an elevated heart rate (tachycardia) and lower than normal blood pressure (hypotension)  possibly indicative of cardiogenic shock. The patient presented with intense distress and was highly anxious.  The patient's history  demographic profile  and key complaints are compatible with a potential diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy - also known as 'broken heart syndrome'. This condition is often triggered by severe emotional distress and can mimic the symptoms of acute coronary syndrome.   The case highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women  particularly in the presence of acute chest pain and emotional stress. This comprehensive case provides an opportunity for medical students to explore and learn about the diagnosis  management  and possible complications of takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,73,"Scenario: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  A. Patient Information  Patient's Name: Judith Fernandez Age: 65 years old Gender: Female Race: Asian Occupation: Retired schoolteacher   B. Medical History  Judith is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol. She does not use recreational drugs. She has a past medical history of hypertension  which is usually maintained with medication  and osteoporosis. Judith has been compliant with her hypertension medications and follow-ups. She has no known allergies.   She is not on any regular medications except for her hypertension. Her family history is notable for cardiovascular diseases; her late father suffered from congestive heart failure and her mother underwent a bypass surgery in the past.   However  Judith keeps herself healthy by doing regular walks and light workouts recommended by her fitness coach. She maintains a balanced diet.   Judith has been going through bouts of extreme stress and anxiety recently due to the death of her younger son in an unfortunate road accident. She has consulted a therapist for her grief resistance and receives counseling of anti-depressants and anxiolytics as prescribed by a psychiatrist.  C. Chief Complaints   Judith reported to the emergency department with the sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the left shoulder  accompanied by shortness of breath. She described it as """"constricting"""" type of pain  persisting for more than an hour and not getting relieved with rest or over-the-counter medicines. She also reported nausea  sweating  and a feeling of impending doom. On examination  Judith appeared anxious  afraid  and in distress.  D. Clinical Findings  Vitals on arrival: Blood Pressure: 160/100 mmHg  Heart Rate: 110 bpm  Temperature: 98.6°F  Oxygen Saturation: 94% on room air. Physical examination is remarkable for cold and clammy skin  an irregular pulse and labored breathing. Rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  Given Judith's medical history  current situation  and symptoms  the trainees will need to look into the possibility of Acute Coronary Syndrome but also consider the symptoms in the context of her recent severe emotional stress  which might lead to a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or Broken Heart Syndrome. ECG  cardiac enzymes a and definitive imaging study (such as Echo or cardiac MRI) could aid with the diagnosis.  The aim of this case study would be to show the students the impact of emotional stress on the heart and help them understand the unique condition of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  its diagnosis  management  and long -term effects."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,74,Patient Case:   Patient:  Mrs. Yamamoto  Age: 70  Ethnicity: Asian (Japanese)  Gender: Female  Occupation: Retired school teacher  Marital status: Widowed   Past Medical History: Hypertension (controlled on medication)  recent history of significant psychological stress (loss of her husband)  no known history of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD)  no previous diagnoses of cardiac arrhythmias or endocrine disorders. She’s a non-smoker and reports occasional alcohol intake.  Presenting Complaints: - Acute onset of severe chest pain which she describes as 'constricting' and associated with shortness of breath. - Nausea with intermittent vomiting. - Intense Fatigue - Profuse sweating  The chest pain was initially thought to be angina  which prompted her to visit the emergency room due to the severity of the pain which did not alleviate with rest and seemed to increase with emotional distress.  This case of a Japanese elderly female is consistent with the established findings that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome ' is more commonly seen in postmenopausal women and often triggered by severe emotional stress. It can mimic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. In reality  this condition is often associated with transient left ventricular dysfunction with identifiable wall motion abnormalities  typically affecting the apical and mid sections of the left ventricle  but notably  no coronary obstruction.  This common demographic representation and manifestation is a crucial factor for enhancing students' ability to diagnose this unique yet increasingly recognized form of cardiomyopathy. It will provide an excellent training tool focusing on the importance of a thorough investigation following initial assessment of patients presenting with chest pain  with a particular focus on coronary angiography to exclude obstructive CAD as a potential cause.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,75,Patient Demographics:  Name: Mrs S. Age: 63  Sex: Female  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired English Teacher  Residence: Urban setting   Past Medical History: Mrs S. is generally healthy with a history of hypertension controlled on medication for the last 5 years. She had undergone hysterectomy 10 years ago and is a non-smoker.   Key Complaints: Mrs S. presents to emergency department reporting of chest pain  resembling an angina attack - intense  central  radiating to the jaw and left arm - that began suddenly few hours ago during her husband's funeral.  Known Allergies: None  Family History:  Mother - deceased  had hypertension Father - deceased  had coronary artery disease  No siblings  Additional Case Notes: On examination  patient appears pale and distressed. Her blood pressure is 155/92 mmHg and pulse is 110 bpm. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities except for a rapid heart rate.  The observed higher prevalence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy among post-menopausal women  coupled with an acute stressor - her husband's funeral - and her symptoms  point a possible diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. But  acute coronary syndrome should also be considered.  Case objective: This case aims to help students distinguish the unique presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  its triggers and differentials from other similar presentations such as acute coronary syndrome. It also serves as a reminder to consider extensive patient history and demographic data as they develop their diagnostic strategy and to avoid anchoring bias i.e.  labeling all subsequent symptoms under a single diagnosis (hypertension in this case).
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,76,"Patient Information: Mrs. Y  a 68-year-old Asian female.  Past Medical History:  - Acute Anxiety Disorder diagnosed 5 years ago.  - Hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago and controlled with medication.  - Non-smoker  moderate alcohol consumption.  Presenting Complaint and History:  The patient is brought to the emergency department by her family after complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath which had begun suddenly while under acute stress. The nature of the pain was constricting and radiating to the left arm  concurrent with severe episodes of trouble breathing. The symptoms had started about 3 hours prior and did not subside at rest. She denied any fever  syncope  or recent injury.  Other Relevant Info:   The patient was recently widowed about 3 months ago and reported having trouble coping. She has been experiencing episodes of acute anxiety for the past few months  with a noted increase in frequency and intensity since her spouse passed away.  This is intended as a representative case study for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also referred to as """"Broken Heart Syndrome"""". Most patients with this condition are postmenopausal women  often from Asian backgrounds  who've gone through extreme emotional or physical stress. The symptoms can mimic those of acute coronary syndrome. Therefore  it's important for the students to learn to differentiate between the two and develop an appropriate treatment plan."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,77,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Training for Medical Students   Patient Profile:  Ms. Risa Yoshida  a 72-year-old Japanese woman  was brought to the emergency department (ED) by her neighbour. She is a widow and lives alone since her only son migrated to Europe. Her past medical history reveals controlled hypertension  for which she takes daily antihypertensive medication.   Clinical History:  Ms. Yoshida has historically maintained a healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise and a balanced diet. Her only noted chronic condition is hypertension  which has been well-controlled with daily amlodipine for the past 12 years. Apart from this  she has no previous hospitalization records or any significant surgical history. She is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol use.  Chief Complaint:  She complained of sudden onset severe chest pain which started a few hours ago while she was watching news of a massive earthquake in Osaka  her hometown. The pain was described as central and radiating to the left arm  associated with shortness of breath. She has no known allergies or recent changes in medication.  Considering the demographic susceptibility and psychosocial stressors related to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken-heart syndrome)  this case is designed to focus on completing comprehensive exploration of the patient's symptoms  identifying potential stress triggers  recognizing the unique diagnostic features of the condition  and evaluating appropriate management strategies. This should give the students clear understanding of the clinical presentation  ethnic preponderance  and the established links to emotional stressors  thereby enhancing their approach to managing such cases in the future.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,78,"Subject: Training Case - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Case Report:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 70-year-old Asian woman who lives alone. She is widowed and retired from teaching. She has two adult children residing in different states. She has no history of tobacco use  drug use  and is a moderate consumer of alcohol.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history of hypertension  for which she takes amlodipine. There's no known history of heart disease in her family. She has been generally healthy and her regular annual physical examinations have not raised any significant concerns.  Presenting Complaints: The patient presented herself to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and faintness  which began unexpectedly while she was watching news about a devastating earthquake in her native country. She explained her symptoms as a """"sudden tightness in the chest  like being squeezed hard """" which she has never experienced before. She was reported to be in visible distress.  Case Discussion: The patient's symptoms coupled with her recent significant emotional stress are indicative of a possible diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition  more prevalently found in postmenopausal women  typically manifests after a severe stressful event or trauma  mimicking symptoms of acute coronary syndrome.   The next steps would involve an assessment of the patient's cardiac enzymes  an electrocardiogram  and ultimately an echocardiogram or cardiac MRI to confirm diagnosis. The left ventricular """"ballooning"""" and absence of significant coronary artery disease would support the takotsubo cardiomyopathy diagnosis.  Through this case  medical students will understand the presentation  demographics  contributing factors  and preliminary diagnosis methodology for takotsubo cardiomyopathy  thereby enhancing their clinical reasoning skills within a real-world scenario.  Clinical Takeaways: 1. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  primarily affects elderly women and is often triggered by intense physical or emotional stress. 2. It presents very similarly to acute coronary syndrome  prompting the necessity for further diagnostic investigations to confirm the diagnosis. 3. When handling patients with significant emotional stress and cardiac complaints  takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be a differential diagnosis.   This concise training case provides opportunities to learn about a condition that  while not common  can occur in a subset of patients that medical students will likely encounter in their practice.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,79,Patient Information:  Ms. Brown is a 71-year-old Caucasian woman  retired high school teacher  residing in a suburban area.   Past Medical history:  She has a past medical history significant for well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. By all accounts  Ms Brown is quite conscientious about her health  maintaining a healthy weight though balanced nutrition and regular exercise. She is an occasional smoker but has drastically reduced smoking recently  having only two to three cigarettes per week.   Chief Complaint:  Her chief complaints include acute onset severe chest pain radiating to the left shoulder  along with nausea  and unusual sweatiness. The symptoms commenced suddenly without an apparent trigger while she was at home. She has never experienced such pain before. She has no known allergies and is currently taking antihypertensive and statin medication.   Rationale:  The choice of a patient in this case is based on the literature stating that takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  predominantly affects postmenopausal women with a mean age of 66–75 years. The condition is often triggered by severe emotional or physiological stress. Although Ms Brown did not report any distinctive stress event preceding the onset of her symptoms  considering her age  gender  and smoking history (which slightly increases the risk)  this case reinforces the idea that takotsubo cardiomyopathy can present even in the absence of a clear emotional or physical stressor. Considering ethnic distribution  research shows that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy affects the Caucasian population predominantly.   This patient’s story highlights the need for healthcare providers to consider takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis for acute chest pain in older women  emphasizing the importance of careful history-taking and comprehensive differential diagnosis. Ms. Brown's case serves to underscore that even those with rather good health habits can be stricken with sudden onset heart conditions.   Please note  the chest pain symptom in Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy can be confused with symptoms of a heart attack requiring immediate attention to differentiate and treat accordingly.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,80,"Patient Background:   Ms. Patricia  a 68-year-old Asian female  visited the ER in a community hospital in San Francisco. She is a retired schoolteacher  married with two children  and has lived independently with her spouse. English is her primary language  though she also understands some Cantonese. She has a history of controlled type II diabetes mellitus diagnosed ten years ago  for which she has been taking Metformin  and she takes over-the-counter vitamins. She has no known drug allergies. Patricia has a history of anxiety and has been seeing a therapist in recent years. She does not smoke  drink alcohol  or use illicit drugs. Her family history includes high blood pressure in her parents but no sudden deaths or heart disease records.  Chief Complaint:  """"I feel a terrible chest pain  the one I've never felt before. It's like my heart is being strangled.""""  Case Presentation:   Patricia presented to the ER with acute onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath which started a few hours ago. She described the chest pain as crushing and constant  radiating to her left jaw and shoulder. This was accompanied by nausea and vomiting. She incidentally mentioned that her favorite cat  Missy  had been hit by a car and died in front of her moments before her pain onset.   Key pointers:  1. The demographic of the patient – 68-year-old Asian female  points toward the common population suffering from takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome."""" It predominantly affects post-menopausal women. 2. The scenario involving the sudden emotional distress of losing her favorite pet aligns with the trigger that tends to precipitate Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  intense emotional or physical stress.  3. Chief complaints and acute onset of severe chest pain  mimicking symptoms of acute coronary syndrome  is a marked feature in takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 4. The presence of type II diabetes mellitus  a considerable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases  can contribute to the suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.     Such a case can be explored further for teaching purposes and can revolve around physical examination  cardiac imaging  differential diagnoses  and treatment plan to ensure comprehensive learning about takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,81,"Case Study: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Information:  Mrs. A. is a 68-year old Caucasian female presenting to the emergency department.  Medical History:  Mrs. A has a past medical history of smoking for the past 20 years  intake stopped 10 years ago. She suffers from anxiety  and she has been diagnosed with chronic hypertension  for which she has been prescribed a daily regimen of ACE inhibitors.   Hospital Presentation: Mrs. A was brought into the emergency department by her daughter  who found her at home appearing distressed and sweaty. Patient reports experiencing sudden onset of severe chest pain  which she describes as a """"crushing"""" sensation  and feeling similar to """"a heavy weight"""" on her chest. The pain started roughly two hours prior to her arrival  and she has also experienced episodes of shortness of breath. She also mentions that it's been two weeks since her husband of 45 years passed away  and she has been under considerable emotional stress and anguish due to this.   Reason to Suspect Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy:  The patient's symptoms of severe chest pain and shortness of breath are indeed common symptoms of a cardiac event. Given her recent significant emotional stress (bereavement)  and the age and gender demographics which are most associated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as 'broken heart syndrome')  there is a strong suspicion of this diagnosis. This cardiomyopathy commonly affects postmenopausal women; literature reports up to 90% of reported cases are in women aged between 58 and 75 years.   Summary:  This case provides a prototypical example that aims to educate on the presentation  risk factors  and precursors to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It emphasizes the role of acute emotional stress in triggering the condition  typifying the significantly higher prevalence in post-menopausal women  and notes the importance of recognizing the overlap of symptoms between this syndrome and other cardiovascular diseases."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,82,"Patient Profile:  Patient Name: Mrs. Susan X (Pseudonym) Age: 70 Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Past Medical History:  Mrs. X has a history of hypertension and generalised anxiety disorder for which she takes regular medication. She has no family history of heart disease. She quit smoking 20 years ago and is a social drinker. Her rounds of routine health check-ups have been uneventful and EKG reports from previous years were normal.   Presenting Complaints:  Mrs. X presents to the ER with severe chest pain that started suddenly about an hour ago while she was attending a funeral. She describes the pain as being similar to """"a tight discomforting feeling"""" in the middle of her chest that also radiates to her left arm. She also has shortness of breath and spells of lightheadedness. She also mentions that she had been experiencing sleep disturbances and loss of appetite leading to weight loss over the past few weeks after the sudden death of her husband.  This case represents a typical scenario of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome) which is more common in post-menopausal women  typically between 58-75. It is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress  in this case  the loss of a loved one. Despite the similarity of symptoms to acute coronary syndrome or a heart attack  patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy usually do not have epicardial coronary artery disease. The syndrome is temporary and reversible  however  early recognition and management are crucial."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,83,Case Title: Diagnosing Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman  Patient Information:  Ms. Brenda  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency room. She is a retired school teacher who lives alone and lost her husband a year ago. She has two daughters living out of state. Her past medical history is notable for hypertension  for which she takes hydrochlorothiazide  and hyperlipidemia  for which she is prescribed atorvastatin. She has no known allergies.  Key Complaints:  Ms. Brenda came in complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that began suddenly while she was recalling memories of her late husband. The pain was described as squeezing in nature  located in the center of the chest  radiating to her left arm; it was not relieved by rest and significantly reduced her ability to move comfortably. She also reported associated symptoms  such as lightheadedness and excessive sweating.  Case Description:  Given the typical angina-like symptoms  initial suspicion was of a myocardial infarction. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was taken immediately  which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads  further raising the suspicion of myocardial infarction. However  subsequent coronary angiography did not reveal significant coronary artery disease that could account for her symptoms.   Left ventriculogram revealed the classic 'octopus pot' appearance  with apical ballooning and hyperkinesis of the basal segments. Her cardiac enzymes  including troponin I  were mildly elevated but not in keeping with a typical myocardial infarction.   Given these findings and her recent emotional stress  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as stress or broken heart syndrome.  Teaching Points:  This case is intended to introduce students to TCM  reinforce the importance of considering this diagnosis in postmenopausal women with sudden-onset chest pain  and better understand differences in presentations of myocardial infarction and TCM. It also emphasizes how psychological stress can trigger significant physiological responses  even severe cardiac conditions.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,84,Subject: 64-year-old Caucasian Female - Suspected Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: A 64-year-old Caucasian female patient comes into the clinic.  Demographic Data: As the most commonly reported demographic for takotsubo cardiomyopathy  Caucasian senior women make up a significant percentage of observed cases. The patient is a retiree and lives alone.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both managed with medication. She has no history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease. She does not smoke and drinks alcohol only occasionally. She has been experiencing increased levels of stress due to a recent death in the family.  Key Complaints: She presents with complaints of acute chest pain and shortness of breath which began a couple of hours ago. She describes the chest pain as a heavy discomfort in her chest and says it worsens when she takes deep breaths. She also reports feeling very fatigued and experiencing some mild dizziness. She denies any symptoms of fever or cough but reveals having suffered a minor fall at home a week ago  after which she noticed an irregular heartbeat but dismissed it as anxiety. She explains that she initially thought it was just acid reflux or gastric trouble  but the chest discomfort hasn't subsided with antacids  prompting her to seek medical attention.  Clinical Considerations: Given her age  sex  and the described symptoms  takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be considered a relevant differential diagnosis - especially given the detailed stress history. Collating information about potential triggers for emotional or physical stress is essential. A complete clinical evaluation should be conducted  prioritizing tests such as an ECG  echocardiogram  and possibly coronary angiography to confirm the understanding of the condition and exclude other similar presenting diseases. An assessment of the left ventricular function period can be helpful in distinguishing takotsubo cardiomyopathy from myocardial infarction.  The training case should emphasize the importance of approaching patients presenting with chest pain in a holistic manner  considering all possible diagnoses rather than focusing solely on the most common causes. It should also underline the need for recognizing the importance of non-classical  stress-related heart diseases in women  like takotsubo cardiomyopathy  that can be missed in the traditional assessment of cardiovascular diseases. The course of treatment to address the patient's symptoms and recovery should also be discussed  including potential therapeutic avenues such as beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,85,"Patient Case Report:   Patient Demographics:   Mrs. T is a 67-year-old Asian woman  a widow  who lives alone in an urban environment. She is a retired schoolteacher  has a moderate socioeconomic status  and is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption. She is also moderately physically active and is fluent in English.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. T has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia managed with amlodipine and atorvastatin  respectively. Additionally  she has been undergoing psychotherapy and takes a low-dose SSRI for chronic mild depression that developed after her husband's death three years prior. However  she has no history of coronary artery disease  stroke  diabetes  or other significant diseases. Her family history reveals her mother suffered from an ischemic heart attack in her late sixties.  Presenting Complaints:  Over the past 24 hours  Mrs. T has been experiencing a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm and jaw  accompanied by shortness of breath  nausea  and sweating. The symptoms started amid an argument with her neighbor regarding property conflicts  which she reports as extremely stressful. There is no associated history of loss of consciousness  palpitations  or syncope.   This patient demographic and characteristics are chosen as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken-heart syndrome """" is most prevalent in post-menopausal women and can often be triggered by severe emotional stress. The inclusion of previously managed hypertension and hyperlipidemia also corresponds to the common comorbidities found in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  "
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,86,"Patient Presentation:  Patient Details:  The patient is a 68-year-old widowed Caucasian female named Alice. She is a retired primary school teacher with a moderate history of alcohol consumption and a non-smoker. Alice has a body mass index of 28.5 which is considered overweight. She lives alone and does not have any immediate family members nearby.   Past Medical History: Alice has a history of hypertension which is controlled by medication (amlodipine). She also experiences some occasional anxiety and depression for which she takes fluoxetine. Alice had also been previously taking hormone replacement therapy following menopausal symptoms. Alice undergoes regular full-body check-ups  the last of which showed no significant abnormalities.   Presenting Complaints: Alice is presenting with sudden chest pain  breathlessness  and acute onset left-sided weakness. She reported the symptoms started soon after receiving news of her close friend's sudden death. She also reported that it felt like a """"heart attack """" which swiftly initiated a 911 call. She was previously well and did not complain of any symptoms indicative of a viral illness  chest discomfort or  exertional breathlessness.   Discussion Points: This short case is typically reflective of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or Broken Heart Syndrome  notably induced by sudden emotional stress. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy predominantly affects post-menopausal women. These details integrate well with our patient Alice  who is a 68-year-old female with an emotionally stressful trigger. Students should also consider differential diagnoses such as Acute Coronary Syndrome. Further necessary tests include ECG  echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers for confirming Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  This case provides an opportunity to discuss the importance of considering a patient's emotional state in clinical evaluations  given the clear connections between emotional stress and various physical conditions. It also serves as a reminder of the varied presentations of cardiac ailments in women  and the importance of considering and ruling out other potential diagnoses before settling on a final conclusion."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,87,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics:   The patient is Mrs. Y  a 68-year-old Caucasian female of middle-class socioeconomic status. She is a widow and recently retired as a schoolteacher. She lives alone in a suburban neighborhood. She has one daughter who lives out of state and visits intermittently. She does not smoke  but her alcohol intake is moderately increased since retirement due to occasional socialization.   Past Medical History:  Mrs. Y has a history of hypertension  well-controlled with hydrochlorothiazide  and a history of euthymic bipolar disorder  managed with lithium. There's no family history of cardiovascular diseases. She also has a history of osteoporosis  managed with alendronic acid and periodic physiotherapy. Routine blood tests are normal except for borderline elevated LDL cholesterol levels. She has no known allergies.  Key Complaints:  Mrs. Y presents to the Emergency Room with chief complaints of sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  which started a few hours after hearing of her sister's sudden death. The pain is accompanied by shortness of breath  nausea  and a sense of impending doom. No history of similar episodes in the past.   Despite her hypertension  Mrs. Y's systolic blood pressure is observed to be low on presentation  raising suspicion of a possible acute coronary syndrome. Furthermore  significant stress preceding the incident and symptomatology that mimics myocardial infarction suggests the potential onset of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""".   Interpretation:  This case is designed to help medical students identify and manage Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and differentiate it from other conditions with similar presentation. Mrs. Y's situation aligns well with demographic trends observed in literature  where postmenopausal women are predominantly affected  and the syndrome is often precipitated by severe emotional stress. The case also represents a unique learning opportunity to research the effects of mood stabilizers on cardiovascular health and the interplay of psychiatric and cardiovascular conditions.   Please note the importance of empathy and reassurance in the management of such conditions  as well as the critical role of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals in the multidisciplinary approach to recovery in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,88,"Patient Information:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  Mrs. A.H.  who resides in an urban setting and has recently experienced a significant emotional stress.  Past Medical History: Mrs. A.H. is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. Her medical history includes type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both managed with oral medications. She has no family history of ischemic heart disease or sudden death.   Presenting Complaints: Mrs. A.H. presented to the Emergency Department with chest pain and respiratory distress. The pain was described as a sudden  intense ache located in the central portion of her chest  radiating to her left shoulder. It was not associated with exertion whilst resting and did not subside while using her usual home nitroglycerin. The patient rated the pain as 8/10 on the severity scale. Accompanying symptoms included mild to moderate difficulty of breathing (dyspnea) and a feeling of anxiety. The pain started a couple of hours after she was informed of the sudden death of a close friend.  Further Workup: Her initial vital signs revealed blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg and a HR (heart rate) of 100 bpm. Initial troponin I level was slightly elevated  at 0.12 ng/ml (normal: < 0.03 ng/ml) .The EKG showed diffuse T wave inversion.   Given the patient’s symptoms  demographics  and increased troponin I levels  the primary concern is ischemic heart disease. However  considering the recent emotional stress and characteristic EKG changes  takotsubo cardiomyopathy should also be considered as a differential diagnosis.  Clinical Teaching Points:  1. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" is often brought on by severe stress. Symptoms mimic those of a heart attack. 2. Though this condition primarily affects postmenopausal women  it should be considered as a differential diagnosis in both sexes across various age groups. 3. There are distinctive EKG changes (diffuse T-wave inversion  QT prolongation  and ST-segment elevation) that could point towards takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 4. Echo or cardiac MRI confirms the diagnosis  showing apical ‘ballooning’ and basal hypercontractility. 5. Most patients have a good prognosis if they survive the initial event  and beta-blockers may prevent recurrence. 6. Emotional stress as a trigger for the cardiomyopathy underscores the need for future doctors to appreciate the mind-body connection in patient care. 7. Psychosocial help may be needed for these patients  emphasizing multidisciplinary teamwork in patient management.   (Note: These findings could be adapted based on the racial and ethnic diversity of your teaching setting or patient population.)"
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,89,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics:  Mrs. Y is a 73-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher  currently widowed and living alone. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She has a BMI of 24.5 and is physically active.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Y has a past medical history of hypertension  which is well-controlled with daily antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril). She also has a history of major depressive disorder which was diagnosed five years ago following the death of her husband. She manages her depressive symptoms with regular counseling and a daily low dose SSRI (Sertraline). She has no personal or family history of cardiovascular disease.  Key Complaints:  Mrs. Y presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of severe chest pain that started suddenly approximately 2 hours before arrival. The chest pain radiates to the neck  associated with shortness of breath  feelings of nausea and “an intense episode of emotional distress” following an upsetting phone call with her son. She reported no history of angina.   Background:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"stress cardiomyopathy"""" or """"broken heart syndrome""""  predominantly affects older women post-menopause. These patients often have a preceding history of intense emotional or physical stress. The typical presentation is similar to an acute coronary syndrome with complaint of sudden onset chest pain  and sometimes shortness of breath or syncope. Classic ECG changes and elevated cardiac biomarkers with absence of obstructive coronary disease differentiate it from acute myocardial infarction.  As this is a teaching case  students should be guided to differentiate between acute myocardial infarction  other differentials of chest pain  and takotsubo cardiomyopathy. They should be encouraged to remember the association of intense emotional stress with the development of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. A consideration of psychiatric background and stressors in history taking can be beneficial.   Considerations should also be made for management plans: supportive care  addressing the acute symptoms and treating the trigger  i.e.  managing the stress or trauma the patient went through."

Examination:  On examination  she was alert but appeared distressed. She was tachycardic  with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and blood pressure of 130/90 mm Hg. She had a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. There were no abnormal findings on auscultation and the remaining of her physical examination was unremarkable.  Key Learning Points:  1) Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy  often presents after significant emotional stress  as in this patient's case with the recent loss of her spouse.   2) Despite no previous cardiac history  elderly women (especially postmenopausal females) are often susceptible to this condition.  3) The common presentation mimics an acute coronary syndrome  with symptoms like chest pain and dyspnea  but without any culprit vessel blockage seen on coronary angiography.  4) Over 90% of published cases are in women with a median age of 67  though it's crucial to remember that takotsubo cardiomyopathy can occur in patients of all ages and both genders.  5) This holistic approach to learning will help to understand not solely the disease process  but also the factors that can precipitate the event. It's a significant interdisciplinary learning step to realize that physical ailments can sometimes be symptoms of deeper emotional or psychological distress.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,91,"Case Study: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information: Ms. S  a 68-year-old Asian female  retired elementary school teacher  currently living alone.  Past Medical History: Ms. S has a history of controlled hypertension  slightly elevated cholesterol (diet controlled)  and successfully managed depression. She is a former smoker who quit 20 years ago. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease (her father had myocardial infarction at the age of 72). She is allergic to Penicillin.  Chief Complaint: Ms. S presents in the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain  light headedness and shortness of breath following the news of her son being involved in a car accident. Ms. S describes the pain as """"a heavy weight on the chest"""" and rates it at an 8 on a scale of 10. The pain radiates to her neck and left arm. She also reports feeling nauseous and experiencing cold sweats.   Given the literature reports that takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome often occurs in postmenopausal women following an episode of severe emotional stress  this case accurately represents this demographic. It is imperative for medical students to recognize these typical presentations and features to ensure the patient is properly diagnosed.   The case should proceed with the management strategies and treatment and preventive options for this clinical syndrome  focusing on the latest guidelines or consensus. Lastly  the case can explore the prognosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the potential complications if it is not managed effectively."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,92,Patient Profile:  Name: Emily Wright Age: 68 Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired elementary school teacher  Case Report:  Emily Wright  a 68-year-old Caucasian woman  presents to the emergency department with symptoms of chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations. The patient describes her chest pain as a sharp and stabbing sensation located in the mid-chest area  radiating to the back the pain has been persistent for  school teacherthance the last 5 hours.   Past Medical History:  Ms. Wright has a past medical history significant for hypertension  well controlled with hydrochlorothiazide. She does not have any known allergies. She does not smoke and only drinks alcohol socially. She is not diabetic and doesn't have any known family history of heart disease.  Key complaints:  Earlier this day  Ms. Wright received the news of her brother's unexpected death. Soon after  she began experiencing the symptoms mentioned. She reports feeling excessively anxious and stressed since hearing the news. She is overwhelmingly worried about her current affliction's similarity to a heart attack.  Key Findings:  On physical examination  her blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg  pulse rate is 110 beats per minute  with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 95% on room air  and body mass index (BMI) is 27 kg/m2. The examination is notable for cold and clammy skin  rapid heartbeat  and labored breathing.  Complementary exams such as an electrocardiogram (EKG) and a coronary angiogram are performed due to suspected ischemic heart disease based on her symptoms and stress event (death of her brother).   Discussion:  This case is a typical representation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  which is seen predominantly in post-menopausal women and often triggered by an intense emotional or physical stress event. Pertinent discussions around this case would focus on distinguishing takotsubo cardiomyopathy from more common myocardial infarctions  understanding the impact of stress in heart-related conditions  and managing the care of patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,93,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. H  a 68-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of hypertension and generalized anxiety disorder  presents to the emergency room with sudden  severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. She rates her pain as 9 on a scale of 10  and describes it as """"a feeling like an elephant is sitting on my chest.""""   She describes her discomfort as having started about an hour before coming to the ER  about 30 minutes after she received a phone call informing her that her son had been in a serious car accident. She has never felt this kind of pain before and states that it """"feels so much worse than my usual anxiety symptoms.""""  The key complaints include sudden chest pain and discomfort  shortness of breath  palpitations  and lightheadedness. She admits to having mild feelings of nausea and sweating profusely during the episode; but denies any headache  blurred vision  slurring of speech  loss of consciousness  or confusion.  Prior to this event  Ms. H's hypertension was well controlled on her current medication (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily). She had no known history of heart disease nor any other chronic illnesses besides anxiety  and she denies any smoking  illicit drug use  or heavy alcohol use. She reports regular walking activities as her form of exercise.  The case aligns with the demographic representation found in literature which reports that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome  frequently occurs in postmenopausal women (average age being about 67-70 years) and is often precipitated by a severe stressful emotional or physical event. The medical history of anxiety disorder is also common in those who experience this condition. It's worth noting  however  that this condition is considerably rare  so students must be encouraged to consider this diagnosis in relevant clinical scenarios despite its low prevalence.  This case is designed to facilitate the learning and understanding of the diagnosis  clinical presentation  and management of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  focusing on the necessity of a comprehensive care approach for patients with comorbid mental health conditions."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,94,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 70-year-old Asian woman living in an urban area.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension for the past 10 years  for which she takes hydrochlorothiazide daily. She also has a history of depression and is taking fluoxetine.

Notably  the patient reports going through significant emotional stress over the past week as she has been dealing with the death of a close friend.   Please note that takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome  predominantly affects postmenopausal women with a large portion of cases found in individuals of Asian descent. The condition is often triggered by severe emotional stress  linking with this patient’s recent bereavement. While not exclusive  a noteworthy correlation exists between takotsubo cardiomyopathy and people who have neuropsychiatric disorders  such as the depression in our patient.   These patient details have been specifically chosen to provide a representative picture of the demographic most frequently affected by takotsubo cardiomyopathy  according to the literature.

As per the demographics of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  it predominantly affects postmenopausal women  with 80-90% of reported cases being females aged 58-75 years of age. Emotional stress is a common trigger  though physical stress may also cause the onset of symptoms.  We want our medical students to consider a differential diagnosis for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and remember that takotsubo cardiomyopathy  stress cardiomyopathy  or """"broken heart syndrome"""" is not as uncommon as once thought. Functionally  it can mimic an acute myocardial infarction but is usually reversible and occurs after a stressful event. Physical examination  electrocardiogram (ECG)  and laboratory tests will provide further clues to confirm the diagnosis in this case."
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,10,97,"Patient Demographics: Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Age: 78 Smoker: No Alcohol Intake: Social drinker  Past Medical History: 1. Patient has a history of hypertension. 2. Was detected with mild thyroid dysfunction three years ago for which she is under medication. 3. Family history of cardiovascular disease (Mother died due to myocardial infarction). 4. Patient does not have any history of Diabetes  renal disease or liver disease.  Chief Complaint: Patient presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that has persisted for the past few hours. She specified that the pain is a """"crushing"""" type and radiates to her left arm. She was found pale and visibly anxious in the waiting room.  According to literature and statistics available  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM) or """"broken heart syndrome"""" often affects post-menopausal women  with a prevalence skewed towards the elderly. A significant physical or emotional stressor often precedes the onset of this condition.   Please note: For the purpose of the case  it would be interesting to incorporate a trigger event that could lead to TCM. It could be the death of a loved one  a heated argument  a surprise party  financial loss  or a serious medical or surgical procedure. Emotional triggers are common  but physical triggers can also cause this syndrome. This could easily be incorporated into the background or history of this character to create a more comprehensive representation of TCM."
