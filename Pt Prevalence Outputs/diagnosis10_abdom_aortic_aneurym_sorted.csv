10,1,1,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial1,Title: A Case of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Background:   A 65-year-old Caucasian male retired toll booth operator  residing in Springfield  Illinois presents with a case of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient is a long-term smoker with a history of 45 pack-years. He has a known past medical history of hypertension  which he controls with medication (1 tablet of Amlodipine 5 mg daily). He is also overweight with a BMI of 28. His recreational activities include fishing and occasional bar visits. The patient admits to drinking 2 beers almost daily. He has no known allergies.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient arrived at the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe and persistent pain in the lower back and lower abdomen. He also reported feeling a constant  intense pulsation in the abdomen. There were no associated symptoms like nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  or fever. There was no history of trauma. He denied any changes in bowel habits or urinary symptoms. He has no history of previous surgeries or familial cardiovascular diseases.  Diagnostic Findings:  Physical examination revealed a palpable and tender mass in the midline of the abdomen. There was no guarding or rigidity present. Blood pressure was elevated at 170/90 mmHg  and heart rate was 100 beats per minute. The rest of the exam was unremarkable.  An urgent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis were ordered and confirmed the presence of an AAA  measuring 6 cm in diameter. There was no evidence of rupture or dissection on imaging.   Given the patient's acute presentation and the size of the aneurysm  he was immediately elected for emergency surgery to prevent potential rupture.  In summary  we have a 65-year old male with a history of long-term smoking and hypertension presenting with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His acute presentation required immediate intervention and this case serves as a reminder of the importance of considering AAA in the differential diagnoses of abdominal and back pain in males above 60  especially with a history of smoking or hypertension.

10,1,2,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial2,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 72 year-old Caucasian male who presents with recurring severe abdominal pain that has been consistent for the past three days. The pain appears to radiate to his lower back. The patient also mentions experiencing a noticeable  pulsating feeling in his abdomen. Despite the pain  there is no apparent change in appetite and bowel habits.  Demographics: The patient is a retired accountant  a non-smoker and drinks alcohol in moderation. Lives with spouse in a suburban home and has been relatively independent in day-to-day functioning. He leads an active social life and is involved in community service.  Past Medical History: Medical history includes hypertension and atherosclerosis  both fairly managed with medications. Patient had a mild myocardial infarction (heart attack) seven years back. He has been under regular follow-up after a stent placement. He is also Type II diabetic and has been maintained on Metformin for the past 10 years. There is familial history of cardiovascular disease  with both his father and brother passing away due to heart embolisms.  Current Medications: The patient is on a regimen of daily medications which include: Amlodipine 10mg for hypertension  Metformin 500mg for Type II Diabetes and Aspirin 81mg as a blood thinner post his stent placement.  Conclusion: Given the patient's symptoms  his age and the significant past medical history of cardiovascular diseases  a suspicion of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm is raised. The pulsating feeling in his abdomen along with the radiating pain could indicate a growing aneurysm. Immediate diagnostic tests including an Ultrasound or CT scan of will be performed to confirm diagnosis and determine the necessary course of treatment.  The patient has been informed of the potential diagnoses and the need for immediate tests. He has consented to further investigations. The patient’s family has been informed and is supportive of the course of action.

10,1,7,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial7,Patient Presentation  Mr. Douglas Jennings is a 70-year-old Caucasian male patient who was referred to the cardiovascular department due to symptoms suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He reports a recent onset of a pulsating feeling in his abdomen  coinciding with back pain. No reports of lightheadedness  syncope  or lower extremity weakness were noted.  Mr. Jennings is retired and previously worked in construction for more than 40 years. He used to smoke cigarettes with an estimated 55 pack-year history  but quit 10 years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally and denies any illicit drug use. His BMI indicates obesity and he has limited physical activities since he retired 8 years ago.  His past medical history is significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite being on antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapies  his blood pressure today was 156/90 mmHg and his lipid panel showed elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels. He has been managing his diabetes with oral hypoglycemic agents. He has no history of prior surgery or hospitalization and no known allergies to any medications or substances.   His family medical history is notable for his father's death at age 78 from coronary artery disease and AAA rupture. His mother  deceased at 92  had Alzheimer's disease. Two brothers have history of hypertension and his oldest sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 64.  Mr. Jennings current condition  background  and family history suggest that he is at a relatively high risk for AAA progression. Given his symptoms and risk factors  the best course of action would be to conduct further diagnostic investigations  potentially including ultrasonography and computed tomography angiogram (CTA)  to help confirm the diagnosis and assess the size and characteristics of the suspected AAA.
10,1,8,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial8,Title: A Case Study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: Presenting today is Mr. John Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male who has filed complaints of sudden  intense abdominal pain that began over the last two hours. He expresses the pain is not localized but spreads across his abdomen and back. This retired automobile engineer with a weight of 80kg  height of 5ft 9in  and Body Mass Index of 26  lives in a suburban setting with his wife.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a significant past medical history of hypertension  atherosclerosis  and a long smoking history of 45 years. With borderline obesity  his hypertension is being managed on appropriate anti-hypertensive medication  while he quit smoking just nine months ago. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease with his father dying of a myocardial infarction at 72.  Present Presentation: Mr. Smith is acutely distressed with his current condition. He rates his pain at an 8 on the pain scale and mentions that it is tearing and searing in nature. Furthermore  he is nauseous and sweaty. He admits to episodes of dizziness and experienced one fainting episode before arriving at the clinic today.  Examination: On physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was noted which is not very common in thin individuals like Mr. Smith  thus leading to the suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). His heart rate is 110 bpm  blood pressure 168/98 mmHg  and respiratory rate 21 breaths per min.  Conclusion: Given his symptoms and physical examination  Mr. Smith is highly suspected to have a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm based on his presenting symptoms and risk factors. This pathological diagnosis is likely due to the underlying systemic atherosclerosis. His current condition is critical and he will need immediate surgical intervention. His subsequent management requires an interdisciplinary approach among cardiologists  vascular surgeons  and anesthesiologists to ensure the right steps are taken to reduce morbidity and mortality.

10,1,10,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial10,Presentation:  Patient Information: Mr. Arthur Johnson is a 68-year-old African American male of medium build.   Presenting Issue: Mr. Johnson presents with consistent  severe abdominal and back pain. There is also a noted pulsating feeling near his navel.  Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a documented history of hypertension and atherosclerosis  for which he is prescribed Amlodipine 5mg daily and Atorvastatin 20mg daily. He also has a 45-year history of smoking  consuming approximately 20 cigarettes per day. He admits non-compliance with his dietary regulations on salt and fat consumption recommended for hypertension and atherosclerosis respectively.  Family History: There appears to be a genetic propensity to vascular diseases in his family  with his father passing away from stroke at the age of 74 and his older brother having had a bypass surgery at the age of 65.   Lifestyle: Mr. Johnson is retired and lives with his wife; he has a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in cholesterol and salt. He exhibits reasonable mental well-being  but acknowledges some associated stress with his current health concerns.  Based on the presented symptoms and given Mr. Johnson’s higher risk profile due to his lifestyle and medical/family history  we suspect that Mr. Johnson may be suffering from an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). It is also suspected that the long history of smoking and hypertension might have contributed to this condition. Mr. Johnson will be recommended to undergo further evaluations including abdominal Ultrasound  CT  or MRI to confirm the diagnosis of AAA. He will also be counselled on lifestyle modifications  primarily smoking cessation  to decrease the progression of AAA and reduce the risk of rupture.

He worked in construction until his retirement and has a 50-pack year smoking history  having smoked a packet a day for the past 50 years. He is a former heavy drinker with sobriety of nine years. He is known with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is a non-insulin-dependent diabetic.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Anderson was referred to the vascular surgery clinic following an incidental detection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) on a recent abdominal ultrasound scan. He came for a consultation with complaints of intermittent severe abdominal and back pain that has lasted for the past three weeks. However  he denied having any palpitations  light-headedness  or syncope which could indicate impending rupture.  Past Medical History: Mr. Anderson is a known patient of coronary artery disease and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft 8 years ago. He has also undergone a right total hip replacement due to osteoarthritis. He was diagnosed with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  for which he takes Metformin regularly. Additionally  he is on Losartan for hypertension and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia which were diagnosed at the age of 62. He has no known allergies. His last tetanus shot was 7 years ago and flu shot was in the beginning of the flu season this year.   Family History: The patient's family history is not remarkable. Both of his parents are deceased. His mother passed away due to old age at 82 while his father had a heart attack in his seventies. He has a brother living in different state with no known medical conditions. He denies any familial incidence of AAA.

10,1,13,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial13,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. John Smith  is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who arrived at the clinic with complaints of a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  along with intermittent lower back pain for a duration of about 6 weeks. He mentioned that the intensity of the pain varies and is not related to physical activity or meals.  Mr. Smith has a past medical history significant for moderate-severe hypertension which was diagnosed 15 years back and a 35-year history of smoking  although he made the decision to quit smoking 2 years back. His blood pressure and cholesterol levels are controlled with medications including amlodipine and atorvastatin and he claims to be compliant with them.   Hyperlipidemia was also diagnosed in the past decade. There is no known history of diabetes  pulmonary disease  or heart disease.   Additionally  Mr. Smith's family history is significant  with his father experiencing an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 70 and eventually succumbing to it.  Given the symptoms presented and the patient’s positive family history  clinical suspicion for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was high. Immediate attention will be given as delay in the diagnosis and treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm can lead to life-threatening complications. High resolution CT scan is scheduled to confirm the presence of an AAA and plan for the most suitable management approach. The patient will be kept under strict observation until the results of the test are out.
10,1,14,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial14,Title: A Case of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith who presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe and constant abdominal and back pain.  Mr. Smith is a retired construction manager who lives with his wife at their suburban home. He has a thirty-year history of smoking  averaging one pack a day (30 pack-year history). He quit smoking ten years ago upon the diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). He drinks alcohol moderately  reporting 7-10 drinks per week.   His weight is in the 85th percentile for his height  indicating overweight. The patient's past medical history reveals hypertension  dyslipidemia  and COPD. His medication regimen includes a daily antihypertensive (Lisinopril)  a statin (Atorvastatin) for cholesterol management  and two inhalers for COPD management (Fluticasone and Salmeterol). There is a known family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of a myocardial infarction at 66  and his older brother underwent aortic aneurysm repair five years ago.  On physical examination  the patient presented with abdominal tenderness. An abdominal pulsatile mass could be felt upon deep palpation of his abdomen. The patient’s pulse rate was 98 bpm  the blood pressure was slightly high at 154/90 mmHg  the respiratory rate was 21 breaths per minute  and the oxygen saturation was 92% on room air.  Mr. Smith was in apparent distress due to pain  therefore immediately a vascular surgeon was consulted  blood work was ordered  and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed with intravenous contrast. His lab results came back  indicating normal kidney function and a slightly elevated white blood cell count. The CT scan showed a 5.6 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Given the high risk for rupture  the patient was admitted to the hospital for urgent intervention by the vascular surgeon. He was advised about the serious nature of an abdominal aortic aneurysm and the need for immediate surgical repair.

There is no known history of peripheral vascular disease or cerebrovascular disease. He has no known drug allergies.  Family History: Both his parents passed away in their 80's from cardiac disease  his father from a myocardial infarction and his mother due to congestive heart failure. His brother had a history of aortic aneurysm diagnosed at 65.  Physical Examination: On examination  there is visible pulsation in the upper abdomen  and a palpable  non-tender  pulsatile epigastric mass is found that measures about 5 cm in diameter.  Investigations & Diagnosis: An ultrasound of the abdomen confirmed a 5.2 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. An MRI Scan was further conducted  reinforcing the diagnosis and helping accurately size the aneurysm.  Working Diagnosis: On the basis of Mr. Smith's presenting signs and symptoms  the results of his imaging studies  the identified risk factors (male sex  age >65 years  smoking history  hypertension  and family history of AAA)  a working diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is established. Further tests are scheduled to assess the aneurysm’s characteristics for possible intervention planning.  Treatment Plan: Given the size of the aneurysm and the potential risk factors  Mr. Smith is outlined for a possible endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or open surgical repair after a comprehensive risk-benefit discussion with him and his family. His case has been discussed at the vascular multidisciplinary team meeting  and we will follow this with appointments to monitor his progress and refine our therapeutic plan as needed.  Summary: In summary  Mr. Smith is a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a significant past medical history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and coronary artery disease  presenting with a substantial abdominal aortic aneurysm.

10,1,16,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial16,"Subject: Patient Presentation with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient: Patient X is a 65-year old male of Caucasian descent who presents with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He stands at approximately 5'9"""" and weighs 210 lbs.  making him moderately overweight. He reports autoimmune conditions are prevalent amongst his close family.  Medical History: The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension and mild coronary artery disease. His surgical history includes a coronary artery bypass graft performed 5 years ago. He was a smoker for approximately 40 years but quit 10 years ago. He also has a history of alcohol abuse  though he has attained sobriety and maintained it over the last 5 years. While the patient doesn't have a known history of any genetic factors that usually predispose one to aneurysms  it does appear that lifestyle factors may have contributed to his present condition.  Present Complaints: The patient presents with persistent abdominal and back pain  which he reports as feeling a pulsation in his abdomen. The nature and location of the pain have made it difficult for patient X to carry on with his regular physical activities  hence the reason for seeking medical intervention.  Investigation Notes: On examination  there's a palpable pulsatile mass in the patient’s abdomen. An ultrasound has confirmed the presence of an aneurysm that measures about 5.5 cm in diameter  which is large enough to necessitate prompt intervention to prevent rupture.   Treatment Plan: Considering the patient's age  medical history  and the size of the aneurysm  the foremost treatment plan is an endovascular aneurysm repair. This will require patient X to undergo preoperative tests to ensure his fitness for surgery. In addition to the surgical intervention  the patient is advised to maintain control of his hypertension and to continue his abstinence from smoking and alcohol.   Patient X has been apprised of the risks associated with not undergoing the procedure (most notably  risk of rupture) and is currently consenting to the surgical intervention. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for post-operative evaluation and to monitor his condition closely. This is a developing case with regular updates to follow."

Chief Complaint: James visits the clinic with a chief complaint of intermittent  moderate  and dull pain lasting for a couple of hours located at the lower-middle part of his abdomen and lower back. He states that the pain seems to be intensifying over the past few weeks.  Past Medical History: James has a diagnosed history of hypertension  which has been medicated and under control for the last 15 years. He is also a former smoker  stating he quit around nine years ago  but had a 30 pack-year history prior. Other past diagnoses include Type 2 diabetes  which is currently well-managed by oral hypoglycemic agents  and hypercholesterolemia under control using statin therapy.  Family History: On further inquiry  his father passed away at 76 due to an aortic aneurysm  and his mother  aged 92  has a history of coronary artery disease.  Physical Examination: On evaluation  his vitals are showing a blood pressure reading of 145/95 mmHg. On abdominal examination  notable is an epigastric pulsatile mass with bruit.   Impression: Given the recorded symptoms  history of tobacco smoking  family history of aortic aneurysm  hypertension  and finding in physical examination  an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is highly suspected. Additional confirmatory diagnostic procedures  such as an abdominal ultrasound  should follow. If the hypothesis is confirmed  prompt surgical review and intervention would be appropriate to prevent risk of life-threatening rupture. Early intervention in James's case is of utmost importance due to his age and co-existing conditions.

The findings suggest AAA  a reasonable suspicion considering his age  smoking history  hypertension  pancreatitis  nocturnal sweating  peripheral artery disease  genetic predisposition  and his hyperlipidemia. He has been advised for immediate medical care and possible intervention should it prove to be an aneurysm.
10,1,19,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial19,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Introduction:  Today we are going to discuss the case of a patient recently diagnosed with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).  Demographic Information:  Mr. John Doe  age 70  a retired chemical engineer  lives with his wife of 45 years in Springfield. He is a Caucasian male  having a BMI of 28 and is known to have been a smoker for the past 45 years.  Presenting complaints: Mr. Doe came to the emergency department with the chief complaint of severe abdominal and back pain that came about suddenly  describing it as 'tearing' or 'ripping'.  Past Medical History: Patient has a well-documented history of hypertension for the last 10 years which has been poorly controlled. He has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 8 years. He also has a 5-year history of coronary artery disease and had undergone angioplasty two years back. He underwent surgery for prostate cancer about 3 years ago. No known allergies.  Clinical findings: On general examination  Mr. Doe was found to be in acute distress. Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass and bruits could be auscultated. Blood pressure was noted to be high (170/90mm Hg). Patient appeared pale and clammy  presumably due to pain and shock.  Diagnostic findings: An urgent computed tomography (CT) was ordered that confirmed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) of 7.5 cm with signs of rupture.   Conclusion: As per the clinical history  presenting complaints  physical examination findings and radiological evidence  Mr. Doe was diagnosed with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  a life-threatening condition. Due to the patient’s age  smoking history  hypertension  and history of cardiovascular diseases  he was already at a higher risk for AAA  a possibility that unfortunately turned into a reality. Hence  this case serves as a reminder to always consider AAA in our differential diagnosis when dealing with patients who have multiple risk factors and present with acute onset abdominal or back pain.   Given his unstable condition  an immediate surgical consultation was sought for possible emergent repair. His subsequent management pathway involves multidisciplinary collaboration including vascular surgery  cardiology  endocrinology and nutrition in order to optimize his medical conditions post-operatively and to prevent future cardiovascular events.
10,1,20,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial20,Patient Presentation:  Good afternoon  I'd like you to meet Mr. Henry Thompson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Mr. Thompson had been a businessman for most of his life and is now retired. He reports to be a non-smoker  but shares that he had been smoking from the age of 20 till 55. He admits to a history of moderate alcohol intake.   On the family front  he is a widower with two adult children. His father died of a heart attack in his late 60s and his mother had a stroke at a similar age. He has one sibling who has a history of coronary artery disease.   Mr. Thompson has a known past medical history of hypertension for which he has been taking antihypertensive medications for over 10 years. He has been reasonably compliant with his medications. He also carries a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia and he takes statin therapy. Additionally  he has adult-onset diabetes mellitus  which is managed with diet and oral hypoglycemics.  Recently  he had been experiencing episodes of intermittent  dull abdominal pain and lower back pain that he describes as vague and discomforting  but had not given it too much focus considering his age. The pain has not been associated with meals  bowel movements  or physical exertion.  On a routine physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was discovered. The preliminary ultrasound report suggests an abdominal aortic aneurysm  measuring around 5.5 cm in diameter.   As part of the standard care and evaluation for a patient presenting with these symptoms and findings  we are looking to conduct a few more diagnostic procedures  possibly a CT scan for further confirmation and then decide the most suitable management pathway. It could be surgical or endovascular repair  depending on the anatomy of the aneurysm and the patient's overall health status.  The patient is naturally anxious as he has been made aware that there is a risk of rupture  therefore it is crucial that we determine the best course of action swiftly.
10,1,21,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial21,Patient Presentation  Patient Information:  Mr. John Doe is a 67-year-old Caucasian male presenting with abdominal pain and a pulsating sensation in the abdominal region.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been using antihypertensive medications for the last ten years and has been placed on statin therapy three years back to control his cholesterol. He has a 40 pack-years smoking history but has quit smoking six years ago. The patient denies any alcohol intake or illicit drug use. His family history reveals that his father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 72.  Presenting Problem: Mr. Doe’s complains of severe  constant back pain that began suddenly two hours ago. The pain was initially located in the middle of his abdomen but has since moved to the lower back. He also indicates that he feels a rhythmic throb or pulsating sensation in his abdomen. He denies any chest pain  nausea  vomiting  constipation  or urinary symptoms but does report some lightheadedness. He has no past surgical history.   Physical Examination: On examination  he is found to have an elevated blood pressure of 155/93 mm Hg. He is afebrile with a pulse rate of 92 beats per minute. Upon palpation  a pulsatile abdominal mass corresponding to the aorta is discernible  with tenderness elicited on examination.   Given the patient's presenting symptoms  past medical history  and physical examination findings  an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is suspected. Emergency vascular surgery consultation has been arranged  and appropriate radiologic studies are being conducted to confirm the diagnosis.   Health Screening and Prevention: The patient has been educated about the importance of strict blood pressure and cholesterol control. Further outreach will be conducted regarding smoking cessation and lifestyle modifications  including the importance of a balanced diet and physical activities. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor the status of the suspected AAA and the progression of his other chronic conditions.
10,1,22,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial22,Patient Presentation: Our patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a sudden onset of severe  sharp  and persistent abdominal pain that is radiating to the back. He mentions that he has never experienced this type of acute pain before. The patient reports feelings of faintness and increased heart rate.  Demographics: The patient resides in Andover  Massachusetts  and is a retired engineer. As a former smoker  he quit the habit 15 years ago but smoked for over 30 years. He occasionally consumes alcohol and lives with his wife  who provides a good support network. He is considered middle-class and is insured.  Past Medical History: His past medical history includes controlled hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both for which he has been on medication for the past 10 years. He had an appendectomy at the age of 25. His father passed away at the age of 65 from a myocardial infarction  and his mother died of stroke at 70 years old. There is no other reported ancestral history of cardiovascular disease. The patient’s routine  which involves light physical activities and a balanced diet  is fairly healthy  and there are no documented allergies or drug intolerances.  In light of his symptoms  combined with his medical history and lifestyle factors such as long-standing smoking  the patient is suspected of having an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). Further examinations  including an abdominal ultrasound  are recommended to confirm or rule out this diagnosis and to prevent potential rupture  which can be life-threatening.   The patient’s hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  being risk factors for cardiovascular disease  may have contributed to the potential development of an AAA. As such  it is critical to not only manage his acute symptoms but also reassess his cardiovascular risk profile and potentially revise his current maintenance medications  if the AAA diagnosis is confirmed.
10,1,23,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial23,Slide 1: Introduction - Patient Overview  Name: Mr. John Doe  Age: 65 years old  Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired mechanical engineer   Slide 2: Clinical Health History  John Doe has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol for the past 10 years  managed with diet  exercise  and medication. He was a smoker for 30 years but quit 5 years ago. His father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 70.  Slide 3: Presenting Complaints  The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sensationally severe and sudden abdominal pain that radiates to his lower back. Mr. Doe also reported symptoms like feeling of fullness in the abdomen  persistent abdominal distention  and shortness of breath.  Slide 4: Primary Diagnosis  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  An AAA was suspected due to the clinical presentation and medical history. Subsequent ultrasound confirmed the presence of an AAA measuring 5.5 cm  categorized as large. The radiologist reported that it extended from the renal arteries to the bifurcation of the iliac arteries.  Slide 5: Patient Risk Factors  Hypertension  history of smoking  familial history of cardiovascular disease  age  and male gender are risk factors for Mr. Doe developing an AAA.  Slide 6: Recommended treatment plan  Due to the size of the aneurysm and presenting symptoms  prompt surgical intervention is necessary to prevent rupture. Options include Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) and Open Repair Surgery. Mr. Doe has been referred to a vascular surgeon for further consultation and management.  Slide 7: Lifestyle and Follow-Up  Mr. Doe will require regular follow-up and monitoring post-surgery. He is advised to continue his antihypertensive medications  a balanced diet  regular exercise  and to stay tobacco-free. Early detection and management of any potential complications will be crucial to ensure the patient’s long term health and wellbeing.
10,1,24,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial24,Title: A Case Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Mr. John Smith is a 72-year-old Caucasian male retiree. He is a lifelong resident of rural Oklahoma  married with 3 adult children  and is a former construction worker. He has a documented history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for about 40 years  although he quit smoking five years ago.  Medical History: Mr. Smith has an established diagnosis of moderate hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been on anti-hypertensive medication (hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril) for the past 10 years and a statin (atorvastatin) for his hyperlipidemia for about 5 years. He has had no previously documented cardiac or other major health events  though he declined routine health check-ups for most of his adult life due to his work schedule. He has no known allergies and other than an appendectomy when he was a teenager  Mr. Smith has not undergone any surgeries.  Presenting Complaints: Over the last few weeks  Mr. Smith has been noticing a dull  gnawing pain in his lower back and abdominal area  which he initially attributed to age-related issues. However  over the last few days  the pain seems to have intensified and become more persistent  leading him to seek medical attention.  On examination: Mr. Smith appears in mild distress due to pain but is fully oriented. His abdomen is soft  non-distended  with a palpable pulsatile mass in the periumbilical area.   Based on preliminary findings  an abdominal aortic aneurysm is suspected. Further investigation with imaging modalities such as ultrasound or CT angiography is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the need for possible surgical intervention.
10,1,25,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial25,Subject: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information:  Mr. James Peterson  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency room with a complaint of severe abdominal pain  mainly in the middle and lower abdomen area that began within the last few hours. He described the pain as intense and unremitting  different in nature from any pain he has experienced previously. He was also experiencing some mild lower back pain and discomfort during physical activities. The patient recorded a slight loss of appetite but no change in bowel movement or urination.   Medical History:  Mr. Peterson has a documented medical history of smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He has been a smoker for about 50 years and has been trying to cut down for the past few years with mild success. He has been treated for hypertension for the past 15 years and takes a daily statin for hyperlipidemia. He has previously undergone a peripheral artery angioplasty procedure. There is also a family history of cardiovascular diseases; his father died of a myocardial infarction at 65  and his older brother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair at the age of 70.  Mr. Peterson in the past has been dismissive of going for routine check-ups but has recently shown more compliance following his brother's recent health scare.  In our diagnosis  Mr. Peterson's severe  ongoing abdominal pain  along with his hypertension  hyperlipidemia  history of smoking  and family history of cardiovascular diseases and abdominal aortic aneurysms  are indicative of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further evaluation and investigative interventions such as ultrasound imaging and a CT scan are warranted to determine the size and location of the aneurysm  which will guide the treatment plan including the necessity for surgical intervention.  In conclusion  Mr. Peterson presents with a high-risk profile for an abdominal aortic aneurysm  with multiple risk factors adding to the complexity of the case. Comprehensive care  including smoking cessation  hypertension management  lipid regulation and possibly surgical intervention  will be necessary in managing this case.
10,1,26,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial26,Title: Case Presentation of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: Presenting is Mr. John Kard  a 72 years old Caucasian male from Austin  Texas. He is a retired military officer and has been living a fairly active lifestyle. He is married with three grown-up children. Mr. Kard is a smoker and has been smoking an average of 10 cigarettes per day for the past 40 years. There is significant past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Coronary Artery Disease. No known allergies have been reported.   Chief Complaint: Mr. Kard came to the emergency department complaining of sudden  intense  and constant abdominal pain coupled with a pulse sensation in his abdomen for the past 12 hours. The patient describes the pain as “tearing” and radiating through to his back. Associated symptoms include sweating  pallor and restlessness.  Medical Examination & Diagnostic Findings: Upon physical examination  the patient appeared uncomfortable  diaphoretic and his blood pressure measured 160/95 mm Hg. A bruit was noted in the middle-and-upper abdominal region with a palpable pulsatile mass. Further testing  including computed tomography angiography  confirmed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) of 7.5 cm  which extends into both common iliac arteries. The aneurysm was neither ruptured nor leaking at the time of diagnosis.   Past Surgical History: Mr. Kard underwent bypass surgery for Coronary Artery Disease fifteen years ago.   Family History: His father passed away at the age of 70 due to a heart attack and his mother had a stroke at 80. His eldest brother had surgery for an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm at age 65.  In conclusion  considering Mr. Kard's age  relevant co-morbid factors like hypertension  hyperlipidemia  Coronary Artery Disease  and smoking habits  along with his clinically detected AAA  it becomes imperative to discuss possible intervention strategies including surgical repair of the aneurysm  endovascular surgery or close monitoring with aggressive management of risk factors. His family should also be advised to screen for AAA given the genetic link.   Let us now explore Mr. Kard's case in detail.
10,1,27,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial27,Title: A Case Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Profile: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male named John Doe who was referred to the cardiology division due to complaints of intermittent abdominal pain for the past few weeks. The pain is described as a deep  gnawing sensation located in the middle of the abdomen  which occasionally radiates to the lower back. The patient also noted feeling a throbbing sensation in the abdomen.   Lifestyle and Family History: Mr. Doe is an ex-smoker with a 40-pack-year history  quit smoking 15 years ago  and claims to live a sedentary lifestyle with a modest diet. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases; his father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm and died due to its rupture at the age of 75.   Past Medical History: His past medical history is significant for hypertension and high cholesterol  both of which have been managed with medication for the past decade. Specifically  he has been on Amlodipine 5mg daily for hypertension and Atorvastatin 20mg daily for his high cholesterol. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago  and has been maintained on Metformin.   Recent Medical Account: Despite optimal management of his chronic conditions  he experienced a weight loss of approximately ten pounds over the past three months without apparent cause and occasional episodes of claudication in the lower limbs reported during his daily activities.  Assessment: Upon physical examination  a pulsatile mass was palpable in the periumbilical area  and systolic bruits were perceptible over the upper abdomen. The patient's blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg in both upper limbs  while blood glucose levels and lipid profile were within prescribed limits due to the regular medication.   Possible Diagnosis: Based on his age  sex  family history  lifestyle habits  symptom presentation  positive physical findings  and past medical history  a presumptive diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the most likely. However  further diagnostic tests such as an abdominal ultrasound or CT angiogram will be needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the size and exact location of the aneurysm.   Conclusion: Given the patient's age  the presence of multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis  and the history of a pulsatile abdominal mass  the patient is at a high risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient needs immediate further diagnostic evaluation and potential vascular surgical intervention given the high mortality rate associated with ruptured AAA.
10,1,28,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial28,"Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Information:  - Name: Mr. John Doe - Age: 69 years old - Sex: Male - Occupation: Retired Engineer - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Residential Area: Urban  Presenting Complaint: John  an otherwise healthy individual  was experiencing occasional episodes of abdominal pain and back pain over the past several weeks. He was brought to the ER by his son after experiencing a particularly severe episode of this pain  which included dizziness and fainting.  Past Medical History: John has a history of smoking about one pack of cigarettes per day for approximately 40 years. He has controlled hypertension  for which he has been taking Lisinopril 10 mg/day for the past 6 years. His blood pressure readings have generally been below 140/90 mmHg at check-ups. His father died of a """"ruptured blood vessel"""" (a likely AAA)  although John is unsure of the precise details.  Physical Examination Findings: Upon physical examination  the physician noted a pulsating mass in John's abdomen  which is consistent with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. John also has a reduced BMI. His blood pressure was slightly elevated at the time of this examination  and he also exhibited tachycardia (rapid heart rate) which can be signs of pain or anxiety  but could be also due to AAA.  Diagnostic Investigation: An ultrasonography scan was ordered and it confirmed the presence of a 6.5 cm aneurysm in the abdominal aorta  demonstrating a significantly increased risk of rupture. In addition  a full blood count and renal function tests were conducted  anchored on the understanding that renal function is paramount before any intervention.  Conclusion and Recommendations: The case at hand presents an urgent medical situation necessitating immediate surgical intervention due to the large size of the aneurysm. The patient was presented for endovascular aneurysm repair. Given the patient's smoking history and family history of AAA  it is also recommended that his immediate family members undergo screening for AAA."
10,1,29,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial29,"Presentation of Patient:  Patient's Name: John Doe Age: 67 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer  Chief Complaint: Severe  constant abdominal pain that began abruptly approximately 3-4 hours ago.

Associated symptoms such as appetite loss  weight loss  changes in bowel movements  or urinary retention were not reported.  Physical Examination: Vitals are stable. Abdomen is distended and tender on the mid to lower part with a palpable pulsatile mass. Auscultation reveals a bruit over the abdominal mass.  Given this constellation of signs  symptoms  and relevant medical history  the presumptive diagnosis is an abdominal aortic aneurysm. An emergent imaging test  most likely a computed tomography angiogram (CTA)  is planned to confirm the diagnosis  identify any rupture and guide further management.  The grave nature of his condition and need for possible surgical intervention has been discussed with the patient. The risk factors for AAA - his age  male gender  smoking history  family history and hypertension are explained to the patient as well. His condition is critical and he needs urgent care. "
10,1,30,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial30,Slide 1: Introduction Our patient under discussion today is Mr. John Doe  an 73-year-old Caucasian male  who presented with an incidental finding of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Slide 2: Presenting Concerns Mr. Doe arrived at the emergency department citing episodes of episodic abdominal pain and discomfort. He reported feelings of fullness and discomfort in the abdomen  especially after eating.   Slide 3: Personal Medical History The patient has a notable medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are well-controlled with medication. He is a 30-pack year smoker but quit around ten years ago. He shows no personal history of aneurysms or other vascular diseases.  Slide 4: Family Medical History Mr. Doe's mother had an infrarenal AAA at the age of 80  but it was successfully coiled without further complications. His father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 72. No other family members had AAA.  Slide 5: Physical Examination  Upon physical examination  no signs of distress were noted. The vital signs were within normal range: blood pressure 130/85 mmHg  pulse rate 78 bpm  respiratory rate 16 breaths/min  and temperature at 98.2 °F. Abdominal palpation revealed a non-tender  pulsatile mass in his periumbilical area.   Slide 6: Diagnostic Tools & Findings An ultrasound exam confirmed an AAA of 5.2 cm in diameter. The aneurysm is located below the renal arteries and is infrarenal. CT angiography is scheduled for precise measurement and planning for intervention.  Slide 7: Conclusion: Treatment plan  The patient's AAA is large enough to require treatment  considering the size and the existing risk factors for rupture (smoking history and family history). We are considering an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) as the preferred treatment option given his clinical profile and infrarenal location of the aneurysm. Mr. Doe will meet with a vascular surgeon to discuss the operation and any potential risks and recovery measures.   Slide 8: Follow-up and Long-term Management Mr. Doe will require continued postoperative follow-up to monitor the repair and the status of his aneurysm. As part of his long-term management  he will be counseled on maintaining his blood pressure and lipid levels and advised on implementing lifestyle changes  including a heart-healthy diet and regular physical activity. Regular radiological monitoring will also be part of his routine follow-up to identify any potential complications early.
10,1,31,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial31,Title: Clinical Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient's Name: Mr. James Palmer Age: 67-year-old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Insurance broker Residence: Houston  Texas  Patient History:  Presenting Problem: Mr. Palmer presents with consistent  dull abdominal pain that has lasted for several days. Available clinical data reveals that the pain is concentrated in the middle-upper abdominal region. Accompanying symptoms include loss of appetite  nausea  and occasional episodes of severe back pain.   Past Medical History: Mr. Palmer has been previously diagnosed with high blood pressure for which he has been taking antihypertensive medications for the past 7 years. Three years ago  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and was recommended lifestyle changes including cessation of smoking and exercise. However  he still continues to smoke. He has a past history of high cholesterol levels for which he has been on statins for 10 years. He does not have a history of diabetes  but his father underwent surgical treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Current Medications: Ramipril (10mg daily)  Lipitor (40mg daily).  Allergies: No known drug allergies.  Family History: His father had a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is also a family history of coronary artery disease with his mother dying from a heart attack in her late fifties.  Lifestyle: He smoked approximately 20 cigarettes per day for 35 years. He confesses his consumption of alcohol is moderately high. He is following a diet with high salt and high cholesterol content and has a sedentary lifestyle.   On Examination:   Physical Examination: Mr. Palmer looks uncomfortable due to pain. His pulse rate is found to be 98 beats per minute and blood pressure reads 160/95 mm of Hg. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the middle-upper abdomen. No peripheral edema identified.  Based on the past medical history  current presentation  physical findings  and the age of the patient  a differential of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is suspected. Provisional diagnosis can be confirmed by imaging studies such as an abdominal ultrasound or CT angiography.
10,1,32,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial32,Demographic Information:   Patient's Name: Mr. John Doe  Age: 73 years  Gender: Male  Race: Caucasian   Medical Presentation:  Mr. John Doe presents with a complaint of a gradually worsening  pulsating lower abdominal pain for the last several weeks. Patient also mentions lower back pain that is not radiating. The pain intensity increases upon moving or walking and seems to decrease while lying still. Patient has noticed an unusual pulsation in the abdominal area. There have been no accompanying symptoms like vomiting  diarrhea  or fever. Regrettably  patient delayed presentation due to attributing the pain to age-related ailments and arthritic changes.  Medical History:  Mr. Doe has been a smoker for the past 50 years and has a significant history of chronic hypertension  demonstrating poorly controlled blood pressure upon past physician visits. He also has a previous history of hyperlipidemia and peripheral artery disease. Family history reveals that his father experienced an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture in his early 70s. No past surgical history has been documented. Upon examination  a prominent pulsating mass is palpable in the mid to lower abdominal region  consistent with the patient’s complaint of a pulsating sensation.   Given this presentation  and considering his extensive vascular disease history  being a chronic smoker  and family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm; an abdominal ultrasound is warranted to rule out the suspicion of abdominal aortic aneurysm. In addition  Mr. Doe's blood pressure management and smoking cessation counseling should be proceeded. If an aneurysm is indeed confirmed  further management should be discussed  depending on its size and rate of growth  including possible surgical intervention if necessary.
10,1,33,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial33,I would like to present Mr. John Doe  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  who has been recently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient initially presented with vague  intermittent abdominal discomfort located in the lower center of his abdomen  along with some back pain. The pain has been mild but persistent for several weeks  prompting an assessment.   Mr. Doe has an extensive past medical history. Notably  he has been treated for hypertension for the last 15 years  which is currently controlled with Lisinopril. He has a 30-pack year history of smoking  having quit 5 years ago. He also suffers from hyperlipidemia  managed with Atorvastatin. Additionally  he has a history of peripheral artery disease  diagnosed 10 years ago. He further reported a familial history of aneurysms  with his father dying from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.   This background of cardio-vascular comorbidities with a smoking history  albeit he gave up  and a positive family history has put him at a significantly heightened risk for developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His maintenance of regular checkups  however  has allowed for the early detection and diagnosis of this condition  improving his chances for successful treatment and management of this potentially life-threatening condition.  Mr. Doe is retired and lives with his wife. He regularly visits his two children and several grandchildren  remaining relatively physically active. His alcohol intake is reported as light to moderate.   In conclusion  Mr. Doe's abdominal aortic aneurysm is assumed to be largely related to his risk factors including an underlying history of arterial disease  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking history coupled with a genetic predisposition from his family history. He is currently being evaluated for possible surgical intervention. Regular structured follow-ups are planned for monitoring and to address his other potential health-related concerns.
10,1,34,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial34,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: - Name: Mr. John Smith - Age: 65 years old - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasoid - Occupation: Retired Army Officer - Marital status: Married  - Insurance: Medicare - Residence: Lives with his wife in the suburbs. - Smoking status: Former smoker  quit 10 years ago.  Presenting Problem: Mr. Smith recently experienced episodes of severe abdominal and back pain  with a specific point of tenderness around the mid to lower part of his abdomen. These symptoms notably have occurred post-meals  and have been alleviated by leaning forward. Mr. Smith feels a sensation similar to a heartbeat in his abdomen and he is extremely afraid that something serious is going wrong.  Past Medical History (PMH): 1. Hypertension: Mr. Smith has been managing hypertension for 15 years and is on medication to aid control. 2. Atherosclerosis: Diagnosed with atherosclerosis  5 years ago which has been managed with statins. 3. Smoking: Mr. Smith smokes for over two decades but managed to quit 10 years ago.  4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Diagnosis was made 7 years ago and a stent was placed. He has been on aspirin and a beta-blocker since then.  Family History: 1. Father underwent treatment for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 72 and died from a rupture at the age of 77. 2. Mother died at the age of 68 from a stroke.  Given the symptoms  past medical history  and family history  his primary care physician suspects he may be dealing with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Further diagnostic tests include an ultrasound  CT scan or MRI for confirmation of the diagnosis. Proactive management strategies would be discussed afterwards  depending upon the severity and size of the aneurysm.  The patient has been recommended to cease any strenuous activities in order not to exacerbate his condition until diagnosis and treatment plans are confirmed.
10,1,35,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial35,Title: Case Presentation on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer  residing in San Francisco  California. His ethnicity and age factor into the increased likelihood of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Presenting Issue: The patient arrived at the emergency department complaining of intense  persistent abdominal pain and severe back pain. The pain  described as a tearing sensation  started suddenly around 2 hours ago and has gradually escalated. He reported some lightheadedness as well.  Past Medical History: 1. The patient has a documented history of smoking approximately a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 50 years  a significant risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysms.  2. He was diagnosed with Hyperlipidemia at the age of 45 and has been under statin medication since then.  3. At the age of 60  he was diagnosed with Hypertension. The patient currently takes an Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for blood pressure control. 4. He has no known history of Diabetes Mellitus  but his mother had type 2 diabetes. 5. No known drug allergies.  Family History: The patient's father died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 75  which accentuates his risk for the same. His mother passed away from complications with diabetes.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient is anxious  in obvious pain with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  temperature is within normal range and breathing at a rate of 22 breaths per minute. The abdomen is tender to the touch with palpable pulsating mass in the middle and upper part.  This clinical presentation and the palpable abdominal mass along with the patient’s history and risk factors are highly suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. However  immediate imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the aneurysm.
10,1,36,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial36,Patient Presentation:  Patient J.D. is a 70-year-old Caucasian man who presents today complaining of persistent abdominal pain developing over the course of the past two days. He reports the pain to be constant and that it is concentrated in the lower abdominal area towards his back. Considered moderate in severity  it is not associated with any palpitation  exertion  or food intake  but rather aggravates upon bending or lifting objects. He was hesitant to seek medical treatment  concluding it most likely related to constipation or age-related aches and pains.  JD lives with his wife of 48 years and is a retired engineer. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension  dyslipidemia  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has a 35-pack year smoking history  quitting only five years prior. He consumes alcohol socially and denies recreational drug use.  Upon examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was detected in the midline of the abdomen  just above the umbilicus. Patient JD also reports a rapid  unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds in the last month.  Given the patient's history  clinical presentation  and examination findings  there is a high suspicion of abdominal aortic aneurysms  and he's advised to undergo an urgent CT scan for confirmation and determination of surgery eligibility. This has thrown light upon the importance of early screening through ultrasound for individuals over the age of 65 who have ever smoked  including early cessation of tobacco use  blood pressure control  and administration of statin therapy as preventive measures.
10,1,37,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial37,Title: A Case Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  I. Patient Demographic Information  The case is that of a 73-year-old Caucasian male patient. He is a non-smoker but has a history of tobacco use for about 20 years during his youth and middle adulthood. He is married and retired from a career in construction. He admits to a sedentary lifestyle due to age and enjoys moderate consumption of alcohol. His weight was recorded at 92 kgs and his height at 175 cm  implying a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30  classifying him as obese.  II. Medical History  The patient has a longstanding history of hypertension which has been controlled using ACE inhibitors. He also has high cholesterol levels managed with statins. He has had two episodes of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in the last five years and was subsequently diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease. He had no allergies to any drugs or food  but significant family history indicates that his father died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm.  III. Clinical Presentation  The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden  severe  persistent pain in his back and lower abdomen with a pulse felt near the navel. Pain was rated 8 out of 10 on the pain scale. He has also reported recent bouts of indigestion and unexplained weight loss. Upon physical examination  a pulsating mass was palpable in his mid-abdominal region. There was no tenderness  rebound  or guarding. His blood pressure was found to be elevated  recorded at 170/90 mmHg  while pulse rate 85 bpm  and regular. Other systemic examinations were basically within normal limits.  All these symptomatic and clinical presentations mandated the necessity of an emergency computed tomography angiogram (CTA) scan to ascertain the nature  location  size  and severity of the suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  This case provides an opportunity for a comprehensive understanding of abdominal aortic aneurysm detection  diagnosis  symptoms  risk factors such as age  tobacco use  the significance of early detection and the need for timely management to prevent catastrophic consequences like rupture leading to a medical emergency.
10,1,38,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial38,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  I. Introduction Good day everyone. Today  I’ll be presenting a case of a 65-year-old African American male patient  Mr. Jerald Booker  grappling with an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).   II. Demographic Information Mr. Booker is a retiree  having worked an office job as an accountant. He resides with his wife in suburban Michigan. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago  with a total of 30 pack-years. He has a history of moderate alcohol use in the past. His familial history is marked by cardiovascular diseases  his father having died of myocardial infarction and his brother currently managing hypertension.  III. Medical History Our patient has a complex past medical history. He has been diagnosed with Hypertension which has been under control with Ca channel blockers for the last 12 years. He also has been dealing with Hyperlipidemia  managed with statins. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 7 years ago  for which he is on metformin. There's no history of any allergies. Mr. Booker is generally compliant with medications and goes for regular check-ups.   His records also show that he was treated for an episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) three years ago  and since then  he is on aspirin for secondary prevention. His body mass index is 28  suggesting he is overweight.   IV. The Present Issue - AAA Recently  during a regular health check-up  his primary care physician noted a pulsatile abdominal mass with an associated bruit  provoking suspicion of an AAA. The subsequent ultrasound confirmed the presence of an aneurysm that was 5.5 cm in diameter in his abdominal aorta  verifying the AAA.   He has been asymptomatic so far  with no reports of abdominal or back pain  no bowel symptom complaints or limb weaknesses  which are symptoms often associated with AAA.   However  given the size of the aneurysm  there's a higher risk of rupture  leading us to immediately discuss and plan for surgical intervention. We believe this is the most appropriate path given his risk factors  the size of the aneurysm  and considering the potential risk of rupture that could lead to a life-threatening situation.  Thank you for paying attention  and I am open to any questions or suggestions regarding the management plan for Mr. Booker.
10,1,39,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial39,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 69 years old Gender: Male Occupation: Retired   Demographics  Mr. Doe is a Caucasian male who resides in a suburban area accompanied by his wife. He is retired and used to work as an Engineer which was a desk job involving limited physical activities.   Presenting Problem  Mr. Doe presented to the clinic complaining of a sudden  severe pain that began in his lower back and radiated towards the pelvis. The pain was noted to be unrelenting and was not alleviated by changing positions or over-the-counter analgesics.  Past Medical History  Mr. Doe has a significant past medical history  which includes hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago  type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 8 years ago and hyperlipidemia detected about 3 years ago. He has been on appropriate medications with regular follow-ups.   Lifestyle  Mr. Doe was a heavy smoker but quit approximately 15 years ago. His diet includes average consumption of salt and sugars. He has limited physical activity since his retirement 5 years ago.  Family History  Mr. Doe's father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 74. His mother is alive and well at the age of 92. He has one older brother who died from a stroke at the age of 59. There is no known family history of aortic aneurysms.  Clinical Findings  On examination  a pulsatile mass was palpable in the mid-abdominal region. A subsequent thorough physical investigation including auscultation revealed a bruit over the abdominal mass. The rest of the physical examination appeared unremarkable.   In light of the above information and the distinct clinical features  a provisional diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is made. Prompt diagnostic tests including ultrasound or CT scans will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess the size of the aneurysm.   Given Mr. Doe's age  sex  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and sedentary behaviour  as well as his medical history of hypertension  diabetes and hypercholesterolemia  he is at considerable risk for AAA. Early diagnosis and appropriate management can help prevent life-threatening complications such as aortic rupture.   Communication Plan  The management plan will be communicated to the patient and his family including the potential need for medication adjustments  lifestyle modifications and possibly  surgical intervention. They will be educated about the importance of regular follow-up visits and immediate medical attention if pain becomes sharp or severe suddenly.

10,1,43,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial43,Patient Presentation  Good day  everyone. Today we'll discuss Mr. John Doe  a 67-year-old Caucasian male who presents with moderate to severe abdominal pain that radiates to his lower back  a hallmark symptom of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).  He is a retired engineer and a smoker with a 25-year-history of consuming 1 pack per day. Doe lives in the suburbs with his wife and cat. He is an avid gardener and enjoys regular walks around his neighborhood. However  his activity has been declining due to increasing discomfort.  Doe has a significant medical history. He has been under treatment for Hypertension for the past 20 years and was diagnosed 5 years ago with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  for which he takes Metformin. He has been rather complacent about managing his blood sugar levels and monitoring his diet. His blood pressure readings have been consistently high in the last few doctor visits. He does not have notable family medical history of AAA. However  his father passed away due to complications related to heart disease.  Upon further examination  the doctor noted a pulsatile mass in his abdomen  a typical AAA sign. Considering his risk factors (age  gender  smoking history  hypertension  reputation for neglecting his diabetic condition)  Mr. Doe was scheduled for a diagnostic ultrasound which confirmed the existence of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter.  Currently  we are developing a comprehensive care plan for Mr. Doe that includes both medical and surgical intervention alongside lifestyle changes to manage his AAA and prevent any catastrophic events such as a rupture. This includes quitting smoking and adopting a healthier diet and exercise regime to better manage his blood pressure and diabetes.  Further discussions will focus on the potential surgical intervention if the aneurysm advances or if any signs present that suggest a higher risk of rupture. The risk associated with surgery will need to be weighed against the potential benefits. Meanwhile  we will closely monitor Mr. Doe for changes in his symptoms or aneurysm size.
10,1,44,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial44,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Caucasian Male   Introduction:  Patient J.D.  is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  currently residing in Dallas  Texas. He is retired and has a 35-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day  but quit 5 years ago. He lives with his wife and has 2 adult children.  Medical History:  J.D. has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been treated for these conditions for the past 10 years. His other medical conditions include osteoarthritis and a remote history of pulmonary tuberculosis treated 40 years ago. He has no known allergies. During the most recent visit  he came in complaining of intermittent abdominal pain  lower back pain  and mild unintentional weight loss over the past few months.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  his heart rate is 78 beats/min  blood pressure is 146/87 mmHg  temperature is 37.1°C  and respiratory rate is 16 breaths/min. An abdominal examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass. Rest of his physical examination is unremarkable.   Diagnostic Assessment:  Given his age  smoking history  and the palpable abdominal mass  abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was suspected. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of a 5.6 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm.  Treatment:  Due to the size of the aneurysm and symptomatic nature  it was recommended that J.D. undergo electively surgical intervention in the form of an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).  Follow Up & Patient Counseling:  For long term management  he has been recommended diligent control of his blood pressure and regular follow-ups are required to monitor the status of the repair. He has also been advised on maintaining a balanced diet  regular exercise  and other lifestyle modifications to prevent further cardiovascular events. The importance of regular monitoring of his AAA and overall vascular health was discussed with him and his family.  Concluding Remarks:  While J.D.'s AAA was successfully identified and managed  his case highlights the importance of being aware of subtle symptoms and regular vascular screening in people with risk factors such as advanced age  smoking  and hypertension.

10,1,47,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial47,Title: Clinical Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Information: Mr. Benjamin Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  a retired long-distance truck driver who lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood.  Medical History: Mr. Smith has a significant past medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia both of which have been managed through medication for the past 12 years. He has been a smoker for approximately 40 years with moderate to heavy consumption (one pack/day).   Reason for Visit: Mr. Smith presents to the ER with the chief complaint of sudden severe abdominal pain  described as sharp and constant  which started a couple of hours ago accompanied with nausea. There is no relief or exacerbation with position changes. He also reports a feeling of a pulsation within his abdomen and a minor unexplained weight loss in the last few months.  Physical Examination: Blood pressure is slightly elevated at rest (145/90 mmHg). He shows signs of tenderness on palpation in the mid-to-lower abdomen. He has a visible and palpable abdominal mass which is pulsatile. His abdomen also exhibits distension and rigidity.   Diagnostic Tools: An ultrasound of the abdomen is recommended  the most sensitive test for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. If confirmed  a CT scan or MRI will be used to glen more detail about the size and shape of the aneurysm.  Summary: Mr. Smith's presentation of sudden severe abdominal pain  a pulsatile abdominal mass  a history of hypertension  a long history of smoking  tends to suggest a possible ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further diagnostic imaging tests are required to confirm this diagnosis  and immediate intervention may be necessary given the high mortality rate associated with ruptured aortic aneurysms. As this is a life-threatening situation  decisions on the best approach to this condition should be done soon. If left unattended  the patient might further destabilize and develop shock. The management pathway might include either endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or open surgical repair.
10,1,48,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial48,Slide 1: Introduction  We are presenting the case of Mr. Alan Thompson  a 73-year-old Caucasian male  retired automobile mechanic  living in Ohio  who has been diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Slide 2: Past Medical History  Mr. Thompson has been a smoker for the past 50 years  with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In 1998  he had a myocardial infarction  which was managed with angioplasty and stent placement. He is currently on a regimen of Aspirin  Lipitor  and Lisinopril.  Slide 3: Latest Presentation  Upon his latest visit  Mr. Thompson complained of abdominal and back pain  particularly on the left side  which he had been experiencing for about a month. He described the pain as a deep  constant ache. No loss of appetite  weight changes  or changes in bladder or bowel habits were reported.  Slide 4: Physical Examination  On physical examination  Mr. Thompson appears to be in mild distress due to pain. Abdominal exam revealed a pulsatile mass in the middle and upper segments of the abdomen. No bruits were audible. There were no signs of distal ischemia. His blood pressure was slightly elevated at 150/90 mmHg.  Slide 5: Diagnosis   A subsequent CT Angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of a 5.6 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. It started below the renal arteries and extended to the aortic bifurcation.  Slide 6: Management Plan  Considering the size of the aneurysm and Mr. Thompson's symptoms  surgical intervention was recommended. Mr. Thompson has been scheduled for an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). He has also been advised to quit smoking  maintain a healthy diet  and control his blood pressure and cholesterol levels to prevent the growth of the aneurysm.  Slide 7: Conclusion  Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and appropriate management. In this case  a combination of patient’s history  physical examination  and imaging studies facilitated the timely diagnosis and treatment. Mr. Thompson’s case highlights the importance of maintaining a high level of suspicion for AAA in older males  especially those with a history of smoking  hypertension  and heart disease.

Patient Information:   The patient is a 75-year-old Caucasian male named John Smith  retired  who lives with his spouse in the suburbs. He is a former heavy smoker  having smoked about a pack of cigarettes per day for nearly 45 years  but has reported to have stopped completely for the past six years. The patient also has a moderate intake of alcohol - about three to four standard drinks per week. His BMI is 27  indicating that he is in the overweight category.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a known medical history of hypertension for which he is currently taking Lisinopril. He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years ago and is on Atorvastatin. He has no known history of diabetes  but does have a history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). He underwent a left total knee replacement surgery ten years ago due to osteoarthritis.  Family History:  Mr. Smith's father died of heart disease at the age of 72. His mother is living  and has well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. One of his two brothers died at an early age from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). His sister has no known cardiac history.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Smith presented to the ER with a 48-hour history of mid-abdominal pain that he described as throbbing and relentless  but not sharp or changing with position. He reported occasionally feeling the pain in his lower back. He also stated that he felt light-headed and had nearly fainted several times. These new symptoms  in the context of his family history  suggested the potential for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Current Medications:  He takes Lisinopril 20 mg once a day for his hypertension and Atorvastatin 40 mg once daily for his hyperlipidemia. No known drug allergies.  Conclusion:  In summary  Mr. Smith's long history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  coupled with his smoking history and family history of AAA  place him at increased risk for developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Therefore  despite his asymptomatic condition  it is crucial that his care team continuously monitors him and includes routine screening for AAA in his primary care assessments.

10,1,55,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial55,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Presentation  Patient Information: Patient  Mr. John Anderson  is a 69-year-old Caucasian male  a retired engineer resided in Boston  Massachusetts. He is a married individual and has no children. The patient has a history of smoking and is a moderate consumer of alcohol. He is non-diabetic and has no known drug allergies.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Anderson presents with severe abdominal and lower back pain that has persisted for a period of two weeks. The pain is described as constant with occasional episodes of sharp shooting sensation. He reports no change in intensity or relief with rest. He also reports a noticeable pulsating sensation near his navel.  Compiled Past Medical History: Mr. Anderson has a known history of Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia which have been managed with antihypertensive (Lisinopril) and statins. He also had a prior diagnosis of Peripheral artery disease and has had stent placements conducted five years ago. Other significant past medical history includes Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) due to his history of smoking. He is non-diabetic and has no significant surgical history except for the aforementioned stent placement.  Family History: His father died at the age of 74 from a heart attack while his mother passed away at the age of 77 from stroke. His older brother has a history of Coronary artery disease.  Possible Diagnosis: Due to the persistent abdominal and back pain coupled with his medical history  an immediate suspicion of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is raised. His history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  peripheral artery disease and especially tobacco usage increase his risk for developing AAA.  Conclusion:  Consequently  further diagnostic imaging using Ultrasound or CT scan will be necessary to confirm the presence and extent of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Intervention will be determined based on the size and rate of growth of the aneurysm  along with the patient's overall health status. Risk factor modification  surveillance  and possible surgical repair options will be discussed with the patient once the diagnosis is confirmed.

10,1,60,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial60,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Presentation   Patient Information: Mr. John Allen  an 75-year-old African-American male  presented with complaints of a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  back pain  and persistent leg pain. He has been living at Mountain View Retirement Home  San Francisco for the last three years with his wife. The patient has retired from his occupation as a lawyer. He is a lifetime non-smoker  but reports a history of moderate alcohol consumption.   Medical History: Mr. Allen has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia since last 10 years and is compliant on his regimen of Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. He had a smoking history of 30 pack-years but quit 15 years ago. He successfully underwent angioplasty due to coronary artery disease 5 years ago and has been following up with Cardiology clinic regularly. Furthermore  he has non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus and manages it with Metformin 1000mg BID. Family history is significant with a father who died of a myocardial infarction and a mother with stroke.   Presenting Complaint: He reported a mild  but persistent  abdominal discomfort particularly below his navel which prompted his visit today. He describes the discomfort as a deep  throbbing sensation that increases with coughing or rapid movements. It is not associated with food or bowel movements. He denies any recent changes in bowel habits  urinary symptoms  or weight loss. He also denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Examination Findings: Upon examination  there is a palpable  pulsatile mass in his abdomen. Labs reveal a slightly elevated white cell count. The rest of the complete blood count  renal function  and liver function tests are within normal limits.   Imaging: CT scan of the abdomen confirmed a 5.5cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with no signs of rupture or dissection.  Impression: Mr. Allen's clinical findings and imaging confirm the diagnosis of a large abdominal aortic aneurysm. Given the size  the risk of rupture is high  and he should be considered for surgical intervention. The patient will be referred to vascular surgery for further management.   Prognosis: With prompt surgical treatment  the prognosis for abdominal aortic aneurysm is generally good. However  there's a risk of complications  such as kidney damage  heart attack or aortic dissection  both due to the condition itself and the surgical intervention. While we hope for the best outcomes  Mr. Allen will have to be closely monitored moving forward.

He describes the pain as a deep  gnawing sensation  particularly severe after meals  localized in the upper abdominal area. The pain is often accompanied by a pulsating feeling near his navel. He has also reported an unexplained weight loss over the last six months.  Mr. Smith has a past medical history significant for hypertension and high cholesterol  both well-controlled with medication. He has been a smoker for the past 45 years with a significant pack-year history. His family history is notable for cardiovascular disease  specifically  his father died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 75. He does not have any history of diabetes  kidney disease  or other major illnesses. His medications include Lisinopril for hypertension and Atorvastatin for the management of his high cholesterol levels.  On physical examination  Mr. Smith's blood pressure was noted to be 135/86 mmHg  pulse 78 bpm  respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute  and body temperature 37°C. He appeared mildly pale. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass  approximately 4 cm in diameter  in the mid to lower abdomen.  Considering the patient's age  smoking history  family history  and hypertension  he is at a potential high risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). These suspicions are further raised by his presentation of abdominal pain and a pulsatile mass on examination. We recommend urgent imaging  preferably by CT angiography  to confirm the diagnosis and assess the size of the potential aneurysm.  If confirmed  prompt vascular surgical intervention is essential for Mr. Smith  considering his pain manifestation suggests potential imminent rupture of the AAA. His long-term management should focus on strict blood pressure control and smoking cessation.

He is a non-smoker and denied any illicit drug use. His family history is significant  with his father dying from a ruptured aneurysm.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr John presented with a several week history of abdominal and lower back discomfort that is relievable by rest. He describes this discomfort as a gnawing type of pain that is centrally located in his abdomen.  Past Medical History:  Mr. John's medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he has been on medication (Lisinopril 20 mg once daily and Atorvastatin 20 mg once daily) for the past five years. He has no history of diabetes mellitus  cardiac disease  or stroke. His surgical history is non-contributory with no known allergies.   Physical Examination:  On physical examination  Mr. John was hemodynamically stable. Abdominal palpation revealed a pulsatile mass around the umbilical area. There was no bruit on auscultation.   Investigations:  As abdominal aortic aneurysm was suspected  a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the abdomen was ordered. The results of the imaging confirmed a 5.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Treatment:  Given the size of the aneurysm and Mr. John's age  he was referred to a vascular surgeon for further management  with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) being considered.  Prognosis:  The risk of rupture of the aneurysm is high due to its size. However  if the patient goes through with the suggested EVAR procedure  the chance of survival and reduction of complications significantly increases.  Follow-up:  Mr. John is advised to maintain a low sodium and low cholesterol diet. As secondary prevention  he should continue his antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medications. Regular follow-ups with the primary care doctor and vascular surgeon every three months are recommended to monitor the aneurysm's size and manage his overall health condition.

10,1,67,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial67,"Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Case Presentation  Patient Information: Our patient is Mr. John Roe  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  currently residing in Birmingham  AL. He has been a long-term smoker and has recently been experiencing unexplained dull pain in his back and abdominal areas.   Vital Signs:  On examination  his blood pressure was slightly elevated  recorded as 145/90 mmHg. His pulse rate is regular with a rate of 80 beats per minute  respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute  and body temperature is 98.6F.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Roe presented with complaints of persistent abdominal and back pain  reduced appetite and noticeable weight loss over the past few months. He indicated that the pain was not related to food intake physical activity. He also reported a feeling of """"heart beating"""" in his abdomen.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Roe has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and high blood pressure  well controlled with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. He was also diagnosed with peripheral artery disease about five years ago. His family history reveals that his father had an aortic aneurysm at the age of 74. He has been smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for over 40 years. There is no history of diabetes  high cholesterol  or coronary artery disease.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable. Examination of his chest suggested chronic changes associated with COPD. His lower extremity pulses were slightly diminished.  Investigations: Computed tomography (CT) performed confirmed the diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). It showed an infrarenal AAA with a diameter of 5.6cm.  In view of his symptoms  age  medical history  family history  physical findings  and CT findings  AAA needs to be seriously considered  and surgical intervention may be required.   Plan: A multidisciplinary strategy involving cardiology  vascular surgery  and anesthesiology teams would be considered for his management. Despite the COPD  given the size of the aneurysm and his symptomatology  he would likely require surgical intervention to reduce the risk of rupture. He would also benefit from strict blood pressure control  smoking cessation guidance  and regular follow-up sonograms to monitor the aneurysm."

History of Present Illness:  The patient reports that the pain started abruptly two hours ago while he was resting at home  and it has been persistent since then. The pain is described as a pulsating feeling  similar to a heartbeat in the abdomen. Additionally  the patient also experienced a period of light-headedness and passing out temporarily.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension which is relatively well-controlled with Atenolol. He also has a history of high cholesterol  for which he is prescribed a statin. The patient was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm three years prior  which was small and had been under regular surveillance with his primary physician. However  he missed his last two check-ups due to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. His father passed away due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm  indicating a potential genetic predisposition.  Review of Systems:  Several systems are implicated by the patients' history and current symptom. These notably include the cardiovascular system given the nature of the suspected pathophysiology and his hypertension  and the digestive system  due to the localisation of the reported pain.  Physical Examination:   Upon a physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable  and the patient showed signs of mild distress due to pain. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.  Based on the above information  clinical suspicion for an enlarging or even potentially rupturing abdominal aortic aneurysm is high  prompting urgent imaging evaluation along with surgical consultation.
10,1,71,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial71,"Title: Patient Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Demographic Information: Patient Name: Robert Smith Gender: Male Age: 72 years old Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer Residence: Phoenix  Arizona  Chief Complaint: """"I've been having intermittent abdominal and lower back pain for a couple of weeks now.""""  History of Present Illness: Mr. Smith reports a several-week history of increasing abdominal pain that intermittently radiates to his back. The pain is described as a gnawing discomfort without specific exacerbating or alleviating factors. He denies any gastrointestinal symptoms but reports feeling fatigued more quickly than usual.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has an established diagnosis of hypertension managed by medication- amlodipine (5 mg daily) and losartan (50 mg daily). He is also a known smoker since his early 20s with a 40 pack-year history. He survived a myocardial infarction 8 years ago and underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty following it. Mr. Smith also reports a history of peripheral artery disease that he manages with cilostazol (100 mg twice daily). He denies diagnoses of liver disease  kidney disease  or elevated cholesterol.   Family History: His father suffered a stroke in his late 70s and his mother died from complications related to breast cancer. His only sibling  a brother  died following an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture at the age of 65.  Physical Examination: On abdominal examination  a pulsatile mass can be appreciated in the mid-abdominal region. He has diminished peripheral pulses in the lower extremities but no signs of limb ischemia.  Imaging and Laboratory Assessment: A subsequent abdominal ultrasonography confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a size of approximately 5.5cm. His complete blood count and electrolyte panel were within normal ranges. His creatinine is slightly elevated  indicating mild renal impairment  possibly related to his age and established hypertension.  Plan: Due to the size of the aneurysm and Mr. Smith’s past medical and familial history  surgical intervention is recommended. He is referred to a vascular surgeon for consultation and potential repair using either endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or open surgery. In the interim  his hypertension management needs to be optimized to decrease the risk of rupture. Smoking cessation consultancy is also initiated."
10,1,72,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial72,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient: Mr. John Doe Age: 70 years Sex: Male Race: White Residence: Los Angeles  California  Presenting Issue:  Mr. Doe came in complaining of a sudden severe pain that started in the middle of his abdomen and radiated to his back. He described it as a sharp  tearing pain that made him nauseous. In addition to his primary complaint  he mentioned having a pulsating sensation in his abdomen for the past couple of months.   Past Medical History: Mr. Doe is a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago but had a 30-pack year history prior to that. His medical history is significant for hypertension  which is currently being managed with medications. He also has a history of mild hyperlipidemia. Moreover  he mentioned that his late elder brother had an aneurysm repair in his late sixties. No history of diabetes mellitus. No history of renal disease or any other chronic medical condition. Closer examination revealed an abdominal aortic bruit.   Speculations:  Based on the patient's clinical presentation and family history  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is the prime suspicion. It is recommended that Mr. Doe undergo further tests  including an abdominal ultrasound and possibly a CT scan  to confirm the diagnosis and ascertain the size of the aneurysm.   Impressions:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) generally occurs in the elderly population  more commonly in men and smokers  a profile the patient fits into. Based on the presenting symptoms  especially the sudden severe pain in the abdomen radiating to the back  the suspicion of AAA is high  possibly indicating a leaking aneurysm. Since he has hypertension  which increases the risk for AAA  it strengthens the suspicion.  Plan:  Once the diagnosis is confirmed  management will depend on the size of the aorta and the presence of symptoms suggestive of rupture or impending rupture. In the presence of alarming symptoms or aneurysm size greater than 5.5 cm  a surgical consultation for aneurysm repair would be warranted. For smaller  asymptomatic aortic aneurysms  management typically involves regular surveillance and control of cardiovascular risk factors.
10,1,73,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial73,Title: Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   I. Patient Background  - Name: Mr. X - Age: 68 years old - Gender: Male - Occupation: Retired Firefighter  - Ethnicity: Caucasian  - Personal Habits: Former smoker  quit 8 years ago - Family History: Father deceased due to myocardial infarction at age 72.   II. Past Medical History   Mr. X has a history of hypertension since the age of 50  which has been managed with a combination of Lisinopril and Amlodipine. His last blood pressure reading taken a month ago was 140/85 mmHg. In addition  he has a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia which has been managed with statins. There is no history suggestive of diabetes mellitus  coronary artery disease  or peripheral vascular disease.  III. Presenting Complaint  Patient walked into the clinic with a complaint of a pulsatile feeling in his abdomen that he has been experiencing for the last 3 months. It has been mostly asymptomatic but he states that he feels a 'heartbeat' in his stomach and a vague discomfort. There are no associated symptoms such as abdominal pain  back pain  or any changes in bowel habits.  IV. Examination Findings  On physical exam  Mr. X is a well-nourished  well-developed man in no apparent distress. Notably  there is a pulsatile mass in the abdomen which is slightly painful on palpation. No bruits are heard on auscultation of the mass. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  These findings raise a suspicion of abdominal aortic aneurysm in Mr. X and we recommend an immediate abdominal ultrasound for the same. Further management would be decided based on the sonographic report.  V. Risk Factors  Given his age  gender  history of smoking  and hypertension  Mr. X falls under high risk for development of abdominal aortic aneurysm. It is important that he is educated about these risk factors  and regular monitoring is initiated.
10,1,74,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial74,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Middle-Aged Male Patient   Patient Information: Mr. Henry Watson  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the hospital following a one-week history of distressing abdominal pain  lower back pain  and episodic nausea. Mr. Watson works as a lawyer and lives with his wife in the urban part of the city. His body mass index (BMI) is 28  indicating that he is in the 'overweight' category.   Past medical history: Mr. Watson has a 25-year history of uncontrolled hypertension and a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes. Despite his prescribed antihypertensive drugs and oral hypoglycemic agents  he admits to poor medication compliance  erratic dietary habits  and minimal physical activity. He has been an active smoker for the past 40 years  with current consumption of 15 cigarettes per day.   The patient also has a relevant family history of aortic diseases; his father suffered from an aortic dissection at the age of 65  and his paternal grandfather died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient has a 10-year history of hyperlipidemia  managed with statin therapy.   Additional details about the patient’s medical history include an appendectomy 25 years ago and an infrequent alcohol consumption. His tetanus and flu vaccines are up to date.  In conclusion  this patient's presentation  together with his age  gender  uncontrolled hypertension  smoking habit  family history  and comorbid conditions like diabetes and hyperlipidemia places him at a high risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Therefore  further workup including Doppler ultrasound and possibly CT scan is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of AAA  determine its size  and assess the risk of rupture.
10,1,75,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial75,Patient Presentation:  Today we have a 72-year-old African American male presenting with a concern of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He is currently residing in New York  NY  where he is retired from an office job. The patient is a former smoker  with a pack history of 30 years  but has quit smoking for the past 10 years. He has a Body Mass Index of 29 and leads a sedentary lifestyle.  In addition to a moderate amount of low back pain and a palpable mass in the abdomen  this patient has been experiencing intermittent abdominal pain that is mainly in the mid- and lower- abdomen area. He also reported occasional feelings of lightheadedness  however there have been no episodes of syncope or loss of consciousness.   Past Medical History:  His medical history includes hypertension for which he has been on medication (Lisinopril) for the last 15 years. He also has a history of high cholesterol and has been taking statins (Atorvastatin) for the past 10 years. In addition to that  he has suffered from chronic back pain for many years  managed with physiotherapy and occasional use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. He does not have any history of diabetes or any known allergies.   He has a family history of cardiovascular disease. His father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 78  and his mother died from a myocardial infarction at age 81.  In summary  given the history of chest pain  a family history of AAA  and his history of long-standing hypertension and hyperlipidemia  this patient has multiple risk factors that make him at risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further diagnostic imaging  such as an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan  would help confirm the diagnosis and determine the size and growth rate of the aneurysm which will aid in developing an optimal management plan for the patient.
10,1,76,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial76,Subject: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Introduction  I would like to present Mr. David Thompson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  residing at 1234 Main St.  Easton  PA. Mr. Thompson is a retired mechanical engineer who is actively involved in part-time consultancy. He presented himself to the hospital accompanied by his daughter with complaints of intermittent abdominal pain radiating to his lower back for the past few weeks.   Demographics Mr. Thompson speaks fluent English  graduated from Penn State University  and is a widower who lives alone. He has two kids  both of whom live close by and visit regularly. He has a history of smoking for the past 40 years with a 20 pack-years history  and consumes alcohol occasionally in moderate amounts. His family history reveals that his father died at 72 of a heart attack and his mother died at 79 with Alzheimer’s.   Past Medical History  Mr. Thompson's medical history includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type-2 diabetes mellitus. These have been fairly controlled with medication - he takes antihypertensive (amlodipine)  lipid-lowering agents (atorvastatin)  and oral glycemic agents (glyburide). He is also on daily aspirin (81mg) therapy.  Presenting Complaint  He complained of pain in his middle and lower regions of the back  which he initially attributed to old age and physical strain. However  the persistence and occasional increase in the intensity of pain that radiates to his lower back led him to seek medical attention.  Physical Examination Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass and fullness in the mid and upper abdomen with an absence of peritoneal signs. There were no symptoms of shock  and vitals were stable at presentation moments with a blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg  pulse rate 78 bpm  and normal temperature.  Summary In conclusion  Mr. Thompson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type-2 diabetes mellitus presents with complaints of persistent abdominal and lower back pain. Physical examinations suggest probable abdominal aortic aneurysm. More detailed investigations like an abdominal ultrasound or CT angiography need to be carried out for a final diagnosis. His history of smoking and family history of cardiovascular disease further necessitates the need for screening for any associated cardiovascular conditions.
10,1,77,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial77,Slide 1: Introduction:  Today  we are presenting the case of a 68-year-old Caucasian male who has been recently diagnosed with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). The patient is an ex-smoker and former construction worker  currently retired. He is married with three adult children and lives with his wife.    Slide 2: Medical History:  The patient has a known medical history of hypertension for 30 years  for which he has been taking Losartan 50mg daily. Other significant history includes high cholesterol  managed with atorvastatin  and a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus that has been controlled with Glimepiride and regular insulin injections. The patient is an ex-smoker  having quit 10 years ago after a 40-year pack-a-day history. He claims to drink alcohol only occasionally.   Slide 3: Presentation:  The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe abdominal and back pain which had started a couple of hours before. He also reported feeling lightheaded and faint.   Slide 4: Examination and Diagnostic Tests:  On physical examination  a pulsating abdominal mass was discovered. The patient appeared pale  sweaty and in distress. An ultrasound confirmed a 6.5 cm AAA. The impairment of renal function was noted with creatinine levels at 1.5 mg/dL  suggesting possible renal involvement. EKG showed no signs of myocardial ischemia.   Slide 5: Discussion:  Considering demographic details  medical history  presentation  and test results  the patient’s sudden onset severe abdominal and back pain  lightheadedness along with the pulsating abdominal mass are indicative of possible rupture or impending rupture of AAA. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in these cases as ruptured AAA carries a high mortality rate. Appropriate surgical or endovascular repair will be considered after a careful risk-benefit analysis.   Slide 6: Conclusion:  In conclusion  AAA is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention and treatment. It is crucial to maintain high clinical suspicion  especially in older male patients with risk factors like smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol  and diabetes. This can help in early diagnosis and management  thereby improving patient outcomes.

10,1,83,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial83,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male presenting with symptoms indicative of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This patient came to our attention due to the experience of sudden severe pain radiating through his lower back and abdomen  specifically in his middle and lower sections.  The patient has a past medical history of hypertension  which has been managed with medication for the past ten years. He is also a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago but had a previous 30-year smoking history. There's a family history of cardiovascular disease  his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 68  and his older brother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair at age 75. His only surgical history comprises an appendectomy when he was in his twenties.  He lives alone  drinks alcohol moderately  and follows a diet high in saturated fats. He is retired and leads a sedentary lifestyle  with minimal physical activity.  In light of his prominent risk factors  including advanced age  male gender  history of hypertension  and familial disposition combined with his current clinical presentation  this patient poses a substantial likelihood for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further diagnostic studies  including ultrasonography or potentially CT angiography if suitable  are recommended for the definitive diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
10,1,84,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial84,Title: Presentation of Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   I present Mr. John Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male who is currently residing in Seattle  Washington. His profession involves being a retired mechanic and thus  he hasn't reported any prior prolonged exposure to detrimental substances other than the occasional smoking before his retirement 7 years ago.  In terms of past medical history  Mr. Smith is a diagnosed hypertensive for the last 20 years and has been maintaining medication for it. He also has a history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) owing to his history of smoking and his respiratory symptoms have been in control under medication. Previously he had high cholesterol  but it's been maintained within normal range through a combination of statin therapy and lifestyle modifications  including exercise and dietary changes.  Recently  he visited his GP reporting dull  constant  and severe pain concentrated in the central and lower region of the abdomen. He also presented complaints of low back pain accompanied by occasional episodes of light-headedness. His pulses in the lower extremities appear normal  but a pulsatile mass can be palpated in the central and lower abdomen suggesting an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).  Given Mr. Smith's age  his history of hypertension  and his smoking habits  his risk of developing an AAA is substantially high  and these symptoms are in coherence with the classic presentation of an unruptured AAA. Therefore  an urgent referral for radiological investigations and vascular consultation should be provided.   Early intervention can significantly reduce the risk of rupture  which can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage and resultant hypovolemic shock. This intervention is vital  noting Mr. Smith's COPD which could further complicate his prospects of surviving a possible rupture.
10,1,85,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial85,Presentation of Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics:  Mr. John Smith is a 68-year-old Caucasian male. He is retired  is a non-smoker  and moderately consumes alcohol. Mr. Smith resides in a suburban neighborhood in Chicago  Illinois with his wife.   Presenting Symptoms and History:  Mr. Smith has been complaining of an ongoing  intense pain in his lower back and abdomen over the past week. He reported that the aching pain is distributed evenly across the abdomen but mainly concentrated in the center. He additionally mentioned feeling a pulse in his stomach  which is synchronizing with his heartbeat. No significant weight loss  changes in bowel movements or urination patterns have been noted.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has had hypertension for the past ten years and has been maintaining it with medication. He also has been diagnosed with high cholesterol  for which he takes statins. His last LDL cholesterol level checked in the clinic six months ago was 120mg/dl and his systolic/diastolic blood pressurization was 145/92 mm Hg. He also has a history of Type II Diabetes managed by oral hypoglycemic agents.  Family History:  He reports that his father suffered from an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and passed away during surgery aimed to repair the aneurysm. There is also a history of heart disease on the paternal side of his family.   Current Medications:  Mr. Smith's current medications include Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension  Atorvastatin 20mg daily for hypercholesterolemia  and Metformin 500mg twice a day for diabetes.   In conclusion  considering Mr. Smith's history of hypertension  high cholesterol  diabetes  and a family history of AAA  these may have increased his risk for developing an AAA. The described consistent and intense abdominal pain needs an urgent attention. An abdominal ultrasound  CT scan or an MRI should be considered for proper diagnosis and immediate management. As AAA is a life-threatening condition  finding an appropriate intervention is paramount to prevent aneurysm rupture and improve patient's prognosis.
10,1,86,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial86,Slide 1: Introduction Our case involves a 72-year-old Caucasian male retired truck driver  Mr. Owen Jackson  who has presented with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mr. Jackson is from the Texas and currently resides with his wife in Austin.   Slide 2: History of Present Illness Mr. Jackson reported discomfort in his abdomen gradually intensifying over the last few months. The discomfort is described as a deep  gnawing pain that does not appear to correlate with meals  activity or other factors. Recently  he’s noticed that he feels the pain more while he is lying down flat and it occasionally awakens him from sleep.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Jackson has a medical history significant for hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and moderate tobacco use for the past 50 years. He had an appendectomy at age 25 and a right knee replacement five years back. His medications include a combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin. There’s a family history of cardiovascular disease with his father having succumbed to a myocardial infarction at age 65.   Slide 4: Examination Findings On examination  there is a palpable mass in the mid-abdominal region. His pulse rate is regular  with moderate hypertension evident. The auscultation of his chest suggests normal heart sounds without any murmur or rubs. Abdominal examination reveals a pulsating mass  and auscultation of the mass reveals a bruit.   Slide 5: Diagnosis The physical examination  symptoms  and medical history align with a potential diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Thereafter  an abdominal ultrasound was recommended  which confirmed the presence of a 5.5 cm infrarenal AAA.  Slide 6: Risk Factors The risk factors contributing to Mr. Jackson’s condition include his age (over 65 years old)  his sex (male)  his extensive history of smoking  and his history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Other factors include his sedentary lifestyle associated with his profession and a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Slide 7: Proposed Plan Given the size of the AAA and the patient's symptomatology  Mr. Jackson will be referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation and treatment. The possible treatment course may include surgical repair like endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or open repair  depending on the surgeon's evaluation. Meanwhile  blood pressure and cholesterol control will be intensified  and he will be counseled for smoking cessation and healthier lifestyle habits.
10,1,87,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial87,Presentation Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a middle-aged Male - A Case Study  Introduction  Patient Mr. Michael Johnson  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired civil engineer  presented to the emergency department with chief complaints of severe  sudden-onset abdominal and back pain. He described the pain as a tearing sensation radiating to his back. He also reported experiencing mild shortness of breath.  Past Medical History Mr. Johnson has a documented history of hypertension for the past ten years  smoking about one pack a day for 35 years  and a family history of cardiovascular disease  including his father passing from an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He has hyperlipidemia and mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  attributed to his long-term smoking habit. He is being managed with daily ACE inhibitors and statins. He also has mild obesity with a BMI of 30. The patient has no history of surgeries  no known allergies  and maintains a moderately active lifestyle.  Clinical Examination Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass accompanied by severe tenderness. His blood pressure was elevated (170/95 mmHg) and heart rate was mildly tachycardic. Pulmonary and neurological examinations were within normal limits.  This patient's age  sex  smoking history  family history of AAA  and hypertensive state significantly increase his susceptibility to AAA. His acute symptomatology combined with the palpable abdominal mass strongly suggested an AAA  prompting an immediate abdominal ultrasound.  Conclusion It is essential to maintain a high index of suspicion for AAA in patients  especially older males with a long-standing history of hypertension and smoking. Its diagnosis can be challenging due to its non-specific symptoms  but the immediate consequences of a missed or late diagnosis make it critical to consider AAA in the differential  leading to prompt diagnostic strategies and emergent interventions.
10,1,88,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial88,"Title: Patient Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  I. Demographic Information: Patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian male. Occupation is retired  and he is currently residing in the suburban area of New Jersey. He lives with his wife and has a history of moderate cigarette use for 40 years. The patient has a BMI of 27  falls under the overweight range.  II. Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with central abdominal pain and back pain which he describes as a """"pulsating feeling"""" in his abdomen. The pain has been of mild-moderate intensity for the past week but has markedly increased in the last 24 hours.  III. Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension controlled on lisinopril. He also has a history of high cholesterol for which he takes rosuvastatin. Family history includes a father who died in his early 70s from heart disease and a mother with a history of stroke. No known history of AAA (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm) in the family.   IV. Social History: The patient is a retired police officer  currently not working. He smokes approximately half a pack of cigarettes per day and has a drinking history of 1-2 alcoholic beverages per week. No reported illicit drug use. He is married and has two adult daughters in good health.  V. Review of Systems: The review of systems is significant for a decrease in appetite over the past week and some fatigue. Denies chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  leg pain  or neurological symptoms. Bowel and bladder functions are reportedly normal.  In conclusion  given the patient's age  long history of smoking  and presenting symptoms  there is a high index of suspicion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The sudden increase in pain intensity might signify a risk of rupture  which would necessitate urgent surgical intervention. An emergency CT with contrast should be performed to confirm diagnosis  assess size and location  and determine if rupture has occurred."

10,1,90,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial90,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   I. Patient Identification  Our patient  Mr. Smith  is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who resides in the suburban area of Chicago  Illinois. He is retired and was previously employed as an engineer. Mr. Smith is non-Hispanic and married for over 40 years  and he has two adult children. He has a limited exercise regimen largely due to mobility constraints.  II. Chief Complaint  Mr. Smith presents today with complaints of sustained and intense abdominal pain  lower back discomfort  and feelings of abnormal fullness which has persisted for the past 48 hours. The pain seems to radiate to his back and does not seem to alleviate with regular over-the-counter pain medications.  III. Past Medical History  A review of Mr. Smith's medical history reveals hypertension and high cholesterol  which have been managed pharmaceutically for the past 15 years. He was diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus five years ago and is under constant monitoring for the same. His medications include Ramipril for hypertension  Atorvastatin for high cholesterol  and Metformin for diabetes.  Mr. Smith underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 10 years ago due to ischemic heart disease. He also has a 20-year history of smoking  consuming a pack of cigarettes per day  although he quit smoking five years ago post his diabetes diagnosis. Mr. Smith mentions no known allergies.   IV. Family History  Mr. Smith's family history reveals that his father passed away from myocardial infarction at the age of 72  and his mother died of a stroke at the age of 78. His younger brother  aged 65  has been recently diagnosed with peripheral artery disease. There is no familial history of abdominal aortic aneurysm.   V. Current Status  Diagnosis & Plan  Mr. Smith's complaints of severe abdominal pain  coupled with his past medical history of hypertension  high cholesterol  smoking history  and presence of vascular disease  raise a high index of suspicion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. We have planned for an immediate abdominal ultrasound followed by a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis. Depending on the aneurysm's size and rate of growth  a treatment plan comprising either surgical intervention or continuous monitoring will be considered.  In summary  Mr. Smith's case needs urgent attention due to a fairly high possibility of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  given his symptoms and medical history.

10,1,92,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial92,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Good day everyone   I'd like to present a case of a 72-year-old Caucasian male patient  Mr. John Smith  who was recently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient is from Anytown  Any State  and is a retired engineer.   Mr. Smith is a smoker with a 50pack-year history and consumes alcohol only on social occasions. Apart from his concerning smoking history  he has a noteworthy medical history that includes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for the past 20 years  both conditions are controlled by medication. He has not had any previous surgeries.  The major symptoms leading to Mr. Smith's diagnosis included a sudden and severe onset of abdominal and back pain  along with symptoms of shock such as dizziness and profuse sweating. Upon admission  he was tachycardic and hypotensive. His meta-static workup was unremarkable  no other organ disorders were found  which led to an ultrasound where the AAA was found. The AAA was approximately 5.5cm in diameter and located below the renal arteries.  We are especially concerned about this case due to the considerable risk of rupture due to the size of the aneurysm  which is a major life-threatening complication of AAA. Hence  we are currently working closely with a team of vascular surgeons to discuss the suitable treatment method  either surgical open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair.  In conclusion  with AAA  we should be paying close attention to and act promptly on sudden severe abdominal or back pain in patients with a history of smoking  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia  especially in older patients. Immediate surgical consultation is warranted in patients with known AAA and abrupt onset of abdominal pain  as delay may have fatal consequences.   Thank you for your attention.
10,1,93,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial93,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Presentation in an Elderly Male  Patient Background: Mr. John Smith is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  who presents with incidental finding of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). He is a lifelong resident of San Francisco and is currently retired after 40 years in a managerial position. He lives with his wife in a suburban area. He has a 40-pack-year smoking history and consumes alcohol occasionally. He is generally independent in his activities of daily living.  Symptoms and Presenting Conditions: Mr. Smith initially attended the clinic for a routine physical examination. He admits of experiencing intermittent mild abdominal pain with associated lower back pain for the past few weeks  which he dismissed as indigestion or age-related. There has been no significant weight loss  loss of appetite  changes in bowel habit or any other symptoms to suggest malignancy.  Past Medical and Surgical History: Mr. Smith has a long-standing history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which have been treated with medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin). He experienced a myocardial infarction about 6 years ago and subsequently underwent angioplasty. Mr. Smith also has a medical history indicative of moderate Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and is an ex-smoker  having quit smoking ten years ago. He does not have any prior surgical history.   Physical Examination: On inspection  Mr. Smith is generally well-looking  normotensive with a BP of 130/80mmHg. Palpation reveals a pulsatile mass in the mid abdominal region that is slightly tender to touch. There are no visible signs of distention  visible pulsations  or skin changes over the abdomen. Rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.   Initial Investigations: Further investigations are planned to better visualize the AAA and include an abdominal ultrasound and CT angiogram for size  location  and morphology of the aneurysm.   In conclusion  Mr. Smith is a 72-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  COPD  and myocardial infarction  who presents with an incidental finding of AAA. His mild abdominal and back pain may be attributed to the aneurysm. The patient will be discussed in a multidisciplinary team setting to determine the best course of management based on his age  the size of the aneurysm  and co-morbid conditions. The team will also consider his quality of life and potential benefit from surgical intervention or surveillance.
10,1,94,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial94,Title: A Case Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired truck driver  who presents with abdominal pain and back pain. He is a resident of Boise  Idaho  married with 3 children  and is a non-smoker but admits to a moderate history of alcohol consumption.   Past Medical History: The patient has a sorted history of cardiovascular diseases  including hypertension  for which he takes Lisinopril  and a previously resolved myocardial infarction 8 years ago. He also has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years and been managing it with Metformin. Additionally  he has had elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol which is being managed with Atorvastatin. The patient has no known allergies. His family history is significant with his father dying from a stroke and his older sister undergoing surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Presenting Complaint: The patient has recently been experiencing sudden  severe  and persistent abdominal and back pain. He reports the pain as a dull ache located below the adam's apple that radiates to the mid-abdominal region. Along with this  he's been feeling fatigue and intermittent dizziness. He denies chest pain  palpitations  nausea  or vomiting.  Potential Diagnosis: Given the patient's age  gender  medical history  especially familial history of abdominal aortic aneurysm  and the typical symptoms of sudden  severe and persistent abdominal and back pain  a preliminary diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is considered.  Approach to Confirmation: To confirm the diagnosis  the patient will be initially evaluated with a physical examination followed by imaging studies including an abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan to visualize the aorta and determine the size and location of the aneurysm.   Following confirmation of the diagnosis  depending on the size and rate of growth of the aneurysm  treatment options could vary from watchful waiting and medication management to surgical intervention. This patient's cardiovascular risk factors will also need to be properly managed as part of an overall treatment plan to decrease the risk of aneurysm rupture.   Informed consent for diagnostic procedures and potential treatment interventions will be obtained after discussing the risk  benefits  and alternatives with the patient.  Conclusion: Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a potentially life-threatening condition if not diagnosed and managed promptly. Proper identification of risk factors  a suspicion based on symptoms  and accurate interpretation of diagnostic tests are key to a successful outcome. This case provides insight into the classic presentation of an individual who might be at risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm.
10,1,95,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial95,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 70-Year-Old Male  Patient Introduction: Presenting today is Mr. Richard  a Caucasian male  aged 70  who resides in Ohio. He has been a smoker for approximately 40 years  exercises infrequently and has a somewhat unhealthy diet  making him susceptible to various cardiovascular disorders.   Medical History: Mr. Richard has a known medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are under control through ongoing medication. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago and manages it with oral hypoglycemic agents and lifestyle modifications. Other past medical records show a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to long-standing smoking.  Presenting Symptoms: Today  he presents with complaints of abdominal pain and lower back pain of moderate intensity that has lasted for the last 48 hours. The pain has been constant  with episodes of sharp  severe pain. He has also mentioned a sensation of a pulse near his navel. No symptoms of bowel habits alteration  weight loss  vomiting  or urinary problems have been reported.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass has been palpated. No signs of renal or liver disease are evident during examination. The rest of the general and systemic examination was unremarkable.   Impression & Plan: The patient’s age  long-standing smoking history  the presence of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  COPD  and the described symptomatology all suggest the possibility of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. An urgent ultrasound scan of the abdomen is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the size and location of the aneurysm. If this is confirmed  an appropriate management plan including the possible need for surgical intervention will be undertaken. Immediate attention will be given to risk factor modification including further reinforcement of smoking cessation. Social support and resources for cessation will be discussed with the patient. Mr. Richard's case necessitates close follow-up and continuous support.
10,1,96,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial96,Presentation:  Today's patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male who presented with complaints of intermittent  dull  and gnawing pain in the middle and lower abdomen and  sometimes  in the lower back. The pain is not associated with any particular activity and occurred about 3-4 times over the last month. There is no loss of consciousness  no chest pain  or shortness of breath. On further questioning  he noted some unintentional weight loss but denies nausea  vomiting  or any change in bowel habits.  He has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  peripheral artery disease  a 40-pack-year smoking history (though he quit 15 years ago)  and a 6 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) identified on screening 2 years ago. He informs you that his brother had an AAA rupture at age 72. He has been in follow-up and has been compliant with his medications  including an ACE inhibitor for hypertension and atorvastatin for hypercholesterolemia.   Physical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass. Neither renal bruit nor signs of limb ischemia are present. There is no evidence of an abdominal surgical scar.  This patient’s history of a known AAA and pulsatile abdominal mass seen on physical examination  as well as risk factors for AAA that include age over 65  male gender  smoking history  and a positive family history  reaffirms the suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. As a safety measure  we are planning to confirm the aneurysm's current size using an abdominal ultrasound to decide if surgical intervention is necessary given the size and the associated pain symptoms. 
10,1,97,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial97,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Geriatric Patient  Demographic Information:  Patient's Name: Mr. David Walters  Age: 72 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired teacher  Marital Status: Widowed  Residence: Lives alone in New York City Insurance: Medicare   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Walters presented to the Emergency Department experiencing sudden and severe lower back pain  which he described as a pulsating sensation. He also reported feeling lightheaded and faint.  Medical History:  Mr. Walters has been managing his hypertension and high cholesterol for over twenty years  which are mainly controlled using medications. His other related medical history includes a smoking habit of 30 years  having given up 10 years ago  and moderate alcohol consumption.  Three years ago  he underwent an appendectomy after an acute appendicitis diagnosis. As per his family history  his father died due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 65  although Mr. Walters was unaware of the diagnosis  with a minimal understanding of the condition himself.  On his last GP visit  six months prior  and due to the family history  an elective ultrasound scan was done  where it showed an aneurysm of 3 cm at the abdominal aorta. He was then scheduled for annual monitoring.  Physical Examination:  On presenting to the department  his blood pressure was found to be moderately low at 100/60mmHg  and his heart rate was elevated at 98 beats per minute. Upon examining his abdomen  it was noted that a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable  indicating a possible aortic aneurysm.  Conclusion:  From the above data  his familial history  his smoking history  and his hypertension  it is highly suspected that Mr. Walters is suffering from an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  potentially at the point of rupture considering his symptoms. He would require immediate medical intervention including potential surgery  depending on the severity of the condition.

10,1,99,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial99,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Case Presentation   Patient Profile Patient's Name: John Smith  Age: 68 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer  Presenting Issue: Mr. Smith presents to the clinic with complaints of steady  gnawing pain in his abdomen that has persisted for the past week. He reports that the pain seems concentrated in the middle and lower part of his abdomen. Additionally  he mentions occasional lightheadedness  but no fainting episodes  vomiting  or changes in bowel movements.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 10 years ago  both of which are well-controlled with medication. He also underwent appendectomy at the age of 22. He mentions a history of smoking of 1 pack/day for 30 years  but quit 8 years ago. His father died of a heart attack at 62  and there is a family history of cardiovascular disease. He admits to a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in fats and cholesterol.   Physical Examination: Vital signs are within normal limits. On palpation  there appears to be a pulsating mass in the mid-abdominal area. There is no rebound tenderness or rigidity. His peripheral pulses are palpable  equating bilaterally.  Based on the combination of patient's risk factors such as age  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  high cholesterol  and family history of cardiovascular disease  along with the physical examination findings  an abdominal aortic aneurysm is suspected.   Further diagnostic imaging (abdominal ultrasound or CT scan) is planned to confirm the diagnosis and assess the size and location of the aneurysm. A multidisciplinary approach  involving cardiology and vascular surgery  is crucial for the optimal management of Mr. Smith's condition.
10,1,100,diagnosis10-prompt1-trial100,Patient Presentation:  Good morning/afternoon   I would like to present the case of our patient  Mr. John Smith. He is a 69-year-old Caucasian male  currently residing in Houston  Texas. Mr. Smith is a retired engineer  has been a lifelong smoker  and has a family history of cardiovascular disease. He is presently on medication for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His wife referred him to us when she observed an uncharacteristic paleness and occasional intense abdominal pain.   His past medical history includes the following:  1. Hypertension: Diagnosed eight years ago and has been on medication since then. He regularly has check-ups and his blood pressure levels are typically under control.  2. Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed six years ago. He was instructed by his primary care physician to change his diet but struggled to comply. He has been on statins over the past four years.  3. Kidney Stones: He had kidney stones five years back but was successfully treated and has had no recurrence since then.   Upon examination  Mr. Smith was found to have a pulsatile abdominal mass upon physical examination. Detailed analysis including Abdominal Ultrasound and CT scan have confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. It measures around 5.5 cm in diameter. As Mr. Smith is also showcasing symptoms like intense abdominal pain and rapid pulse  I believe he is a high-risk patient who needs immediate attention.   Taking into consideration his age  vascular factors like hypertension and hyperlipidemia as well as his smoking history  his prognosis merits further discussion. Luckily  we identified the aneurysm before rupture. Aneurysm repair  endovascular or open depending on his fitness for surgery  would be the best course in his case to avoid life-threatening rupture.   A multi-disciplinary approach including advising lifestyle modifications  managing his chronic conditions and planning for prompt intervention to handle the aneurysm would be favorable in managing Mr. Smith’s condition.   Thank you for your attention. I welcome any questions or suggestions you might have regarding this case.

10,2,95,diagnosis10-prompt2-trial95,Patient Information: Mr. John Thompson  an 68-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the clinic today.  Chief Complaint: The patient reports a consistent  dull pain in the lower abdomen and lower back. He notes that the pain occasionally tends to peak suddenly  increasing in intensity  then decreases back to a steady dull ache.  History of Present Illness: Upon probing  patient states that he noticed the pain roughly 3 weeks ago  and it has been gradually worsening over that time. Periods of intense pain duration last approximately 5-10 minutes at a time. The patient denies any recent changes in bowel or bladder habits  but confirms a twelve-pound unintentional weight loss in the last two months. He also complains about feeling generally fatigued lately.   Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson mentions he has a history of smoking (1 pack per day for the last 35 years) and hypertension which is being treated with atenolol. He has had no previous surgeries  no known drug allergies  and reports no history of gastrointestinal or genitourinary disorders. He has not previously reported any symptoms related to aneurysm.  Review of Systems: Abdominal pain is localized and dull  without radiation. No associated symptoms like nausea  vomiting  fever  chills or malaise. All other systems are unremarkable.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  the patient appears anxious and in mild distress due to his abdominal pain. The abdomen is non-distended with a pulsatile mass palpable in the mid-abdomen. No bruits are audible over the mass. Lower extremity pulses in both the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries are strong and symmetric.  Assessment: The symptoms and physical exam findings  although non-specific  show that we need to consider the possibility of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). A patient presenting with unexplained  persistent abdominal or back pain - especially with risk factors such as a history of smoking and hypertension - warrants investigation into this life-threatening condition.   Plan: Order an abdominal ultrasound for definitive diagnosis. Depending on the results  prepare for potential surgical intervention  either with open repair or endovascular procedure.

10,3,2,diagnosis10-prompt3-trial2,Slide 1: Introduction Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a balloon-like enlargement in the part of the aorta passing through the abdomen.  Slide 2: Case Study - Mr. Jones Let's examine the case of Mr. Jones  a 68-year-old Caucasian male from a suburban environment. He's been a regular smoker for the past 40 years and has a family history of cardiovascular disease. His father died in his 60s with an AAA rupture.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mr. Jones has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral artery disease. He was diagnosed with type II diabetes about six years ago. He is currently on medication for his chronic conditions.  Slide 4: Latest Presentation  Mr. Jones came in complaining of abdominal discomfort and lower back pain. He indicated that he had recently noticed a pulsating feeling in his abdomen.   Slide 5: Physical Examination  On assessment  Jay's vital signs were within normal limits. However  there was a palpable pulsating mass in his abdomen. Auscultation revealed a bruit over his abdomen  and he was slightly tender over his lower back region.   Slide 6: Diagnostic Testing  Given his symptoms  family history  and medical background  a suspicion of AAA was raised. An ultrasound confirmed the presence of an AAA  measuring 5.5 cm in diameter.   Slide 7: Management  Due to the size of the aneurysm and his symptoms  surgical options were discussed with Mr. Jones. He is scheduled for an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). In addition to the surgical intervention  we also planned a management strategy for his chronic conditions and recommended smoking cessation.

10,3,8,diagnosis10-prompt3-trial8,"Slide 1: Introduction   This presentation will detail a case study of a patient with an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). AAA is a pathological dilatation of the abdominal aorta  which if left untreated may lead to deadly ruptures.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics   Our patient  Mr. White  is a 72-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired mechanic  living with his wife  and is a father of three grown-up children. He's relatively independent  with some assistance needed for grocery shopping and cleaning duties.   Slide 3: Past Medical History   Mr. White has a history of smoking for about 35 years  though he quit 15 years ago. He has been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia around 10 years ago which are managed with medications. There's also a family history of cardiovascular diseases  and his father passed away due to an AAA rupture.  Slide 4: Presenting Complaint   Mr. White visited his general practitioner  reporting a few weeks of intermittent  dull abdominal pain  particularly after meals. It was initially suspected to be gastritis and treated accordingly. However  the pain persisted  prompting further investigation.  Slide 5: Clinical Examination   On examination  a pulsating abdominal mass was noted. Mr. White reported tenderness over that area. On further query  he mentioned feelings of """"fullness"""" and occasional lower back pain.   Slide 6: Diagnostic Procedures   An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of an AAA with a diameter slightly above 5 cm. He was immediately referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation.   Slide 7: Management   An endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) procedure was performed to prevent rupture of the AAA  considering his age  the size of the AAA  and other risk factors.   Slide 8: Follow-up and Prognosis   Mr. White was discharged with follow-up appointments and instructions on lifestyle modification. Regular monitoring of his AAA would be essential moving forward. Prognosis for stable and repaired AAA is generally good  but it's essential to continuously manage associated risk factors like hypertension and hyperlipidemia.   Slide 9: Lesson Learned   This case highlights the importance of comprehensive examination in elderly patients  especially with risk factors presenting with dull  abdominal pain."
10,3,9,diagnosis10-prompt3-trial9,Slide 1: Introduction  Today we will be discussing the case of a patient diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. By the end of the presentation  we will have a clearer understanding about this medical condition  and how it might be managed and treated.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired  with a history of smoking. He is a widower  lives alone and is mostly sedentary.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has been treated for high blood pressure for the past 20 years and is on an antihypertensive regimen. He also has a family history of cardiovascular disease. He was a smoker for 40 years but quit 10 years ago. He does have mild obesity (BMI 30.5) and a past history of high cholesterol for which he takes statins.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms  The patient came to the hospital complaining of an intense and unending abdominal pain along with mild dizziness. The pain is localized to the center and lower parts of his abdomen. There is no associated chest pain  nausea  vomiting or palpitations.  Slide 5: Physical Examination and Diagnosis  On physical examination  a pulsatile mass was appreciated in the patient's abdominal area. Further investigation using a CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Slide 6: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  A AAA is an enlarged area in the lower aorta  the major blood vessel that supplies blood to the body. The aorta runs from the heart through the center of the chest and abdomen. The risk of AAA increases with age  family history of AAA  smoking and being male. Our patient fits into these risk factors.  Slide 7: Treatment Plan  The patient's large  symptomatic AAA requires immediate surgical repair to prevent rupture. He will be referred to a vascular surgeon for an open or endovascular surgery.  Slide 8: Conclusion  This case highlights the importance of considering AAA with patients who have intense abdominal pain combined with a recognized pulsatile mass. Early recognition and intervention are vital to preventing devastating outcomes such as rupture or death due to its asymptomatic nature.

10,3,100,diagnosis10-prompt3-trial100,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm - A Case Study  [Slide 1] Introduction: This presentation aims to explore a clinical case of a patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). This case study can serve as a tool to understand AAA's clinical presentations  risk factors  diagnosis  and management options.   [Slide 2] Patient Demographics: This case involves a 72-year-old male  of Caucasian descent  non-smoker but with a history of occasional drinker. He is a retired civil engineer  is married with 3 grown-up children and lives with his wife.  [Slide 3] Past Medical History: The patient has a history of controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He managed these conditions with lifestyle modifications and medication. He also had an appendectomy at age 25. Family history reveals that his father passed away due to myocardial infarction at age 65.   [Slide 4] Presenting Symptoms & Examination: The patient visited the emergency department with a chief complaint of intermittent abdominal pain and lower back pain for the past week. Abdominal examination showed a pulsatile abdominal mass.   [Slide 5] Investigations: A Doppler ultrasonography was done  which confirmed an infrarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  with a diameter of approximately 6 cm. Further assessment by CT angiogram was recommended.   [Slide 6] Diagnosis: Based on presenting symptoms  physical examination  and ultrasonography results  the patient was diagnosed with an infrarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.   [Slide 7] Management: Given the size of the aneurysm and risks associated  the patient was referred for an urgent vascular surgical consultation. Elective repair  either open surgery or endovascular repair  was discussed with the patient and his family.   [Slide 8] Conclusion: This case emphasizes the need for early identification and management of AAA. Whilst it is often asymptomatic until rupture  when it can be lethal  an incidental finding in a high-risk individual like our patient must be evaluated urgently to prevent devastating consequences.

The pain is constant  radiates to the back and lower extremities  and has lasted for approximately three hours. The patient denies symptoms of chest pain  shortness of breath  nausea  vomiting or changes in bowel and bladder habits. On examination  there is a palpable  pulsating mass in the central abdomen and a bruit is auscultated over the mass. The patient's blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg and pulse rate is 90 bpm.   Possible risk factors in this patient's past medical history include chronic hypertension  which can cause increased pressure on the arterial wall and lead to aneurysm formation. Hyperlipidemia can also contribute to artherosclerotic changes and weakening of the arterial wall structure. The sudden onset  severe abdominal pain radiating to the back is highly suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The palpable  pulsating abdominal mass on examination appears to confirm this suspicion. This is deemed a serious  life-threatening condition as it can lead to aortic rupture which can cause internal bleeding and shock.

10,6,1,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial1,Problem Representation:   Patient Profile:   A 72-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with a sudden  severe pain in his lower back and abdomen that started a few hours ago. The pain is not radiating anywhere and is accompanied by a lightheadedness and a feeling of unease. The patient has a history of smoking  but quit about 10 years ago. He is a retired accountant and lives with his wife. They have two adult children and four grandchildren.   Relevant Past Medical History:   The patient has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels for which he takes medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin). The patient also has a previous history of peripheral artery disease and is on baby Aspirin. The patient was diagnosed with early-stage COPD last year due to his smoking history. He is not diabetic  and there is no reported history of cancer or kidney diseases.   Family History:  The patient's father had cardiovascular disease and died from a stroke. His mother had Alzheimer's. He also has an older brother who was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  which was successfully repaired years ago.   Current medications:   - Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension - Atorvastatin 20mg daily for high cholesterol levels - Aspirin 81mg daily for peripheral artery disease - Inhalers for COPD (Albuterol as needed and Symbicort 160/4.5mcg bid)  Evaluation and Problem Identification:  Given the patient's history of hypertension  high cholesterol levels  peripheral artery disease  elderly age  and familial history of AAA  the clinician considered a possible ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The acute onset of severe and persistent lower back and abdominal pain further supports this hypothesis. The low blood pressure and the feeling of unease could suggest shock or internal bleeding. An urgent abdominal ultrasound is required to confirm the diagnosis.   Plan:  - Commence ABC's of life support - Emergency ultrasound - Consultation with vascular surgery - MRI if condition allows - Blood tests: Complete blood count  renal function  coagulation profile  blood type and crossmatch - IV fluids and pain management (consider opioid analgesia) - Blood pressure and heart rate monitoring - Surgery if AAA is confirmed (endovascular repair vs. open repair depending on the patient's health and the size and location of the aneurysm).   Differential Diagnoses:  - Renal Colic (due to the location of pain) - Myocardial infarction (given the history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels) - Gastro-intestinal problems like acute appendicitis  diverticulitis or pancreatitis

He reports moderate alcohol use and has been retired for eight years after working in a high-stress management role. The patient is married with three adult children and six grandchildren.  Past Medical History:   1. Atherosclerosis: The patient was diagnosed with atherosclerosis 12 years ago when he began struggling with chest pain. His condition has been managed with a combination of medication  diet  and exercise.  2. Hypertension: He has a 15-year history of hypertension  which is usually well-controlled with ACE inhibitors and lifestyle modifications.  3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was diagnosed with diabetes 8 years ago. He controls his condition primarily with metformin and adherence to a balanced diet. His last HbA1c level was 6.7%  which was taken 3 months ago. 4. Previous myocardial infarction: He had an MI at the age of 58  which led to a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.  Family History:  The patient's father died at age 72 from a heart attack  and his mother died at 79 from stroke complications. One older brother died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at age 67.  Current Complaint:   The patient presents with lower back pain and a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  which he initially associated with his hypertension or a digestive problem. He came for a check-up after his brother's aneurysm disaster. His physician hence decided to screen him for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  given his age  gender  tobacco history  family history of AAA  and other risk factors.   Vital Signs:   Blood pressure: 145/85 mmHg Heart rate: 76 bpm Temperature: 98.6 F Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per min BMI: 27  General Physical Examination:   Upon examination  the patient appears alert and oriented.

10,6,18,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial18,Problem Representation:  Mr. Peterson is a 73-year-old Caucasian male brought to the emergency room due to a sudden onset of abdominal pain. It was described as severe  intermittent  and radiating to his back. The patient also noted feelings of a pulsating sensation in his abdomen. Other relevant symptoms include a decreased appetite  weight loss  and fainting spells.  The patient's lifestyle revolves around his 40 years of history as a heavy smoker  averaging about 2 packs a day. He consumes alcohol only on social occasions  and his diet mostly includes high-fat content owing to his preference for fast food. He does not engage in regular physical exercises.  Mr. Peterson's past medical history shows several risk factors such as hypertension and high blood cholesterol levels  both of which he is on medication for. He has undergone angioplasty for coronary artery disease 3 years ago. He also has peripheral artery disease and suffered from a transient ischemic attack (TIA) last year.  In addition to the family history of cardiovascular disease (His father had fatal aortic aneurysm rupture  and his brother suffers from coronary arterial disease)  recent examinations identified calcification in the abdominal aorta. Furthermore  he has a history of obesity and was diagnosed with prediabetes. Given these findings  Mr. Peterson's overall clinical picture increases his risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm.   There are no known drug allergies. He is on antihypertensive medication  statins for cholesterol  and antiplatelet for coronary and peripheral arterial disease.   Lastly  his social history reveals a retired firefighter  widowed with three grown-up children. He lives alone  and his children visit him periodically.

10,6,19,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial19,Problem Representation:  Subject: A 69-year-old Caucasian male.  Chief complaint:  Sudden pain in the lower back and abdomen that is severe  throbbing  and constant. No history of physical trauma.  Demographics and personal history: The patient is a former construction worker who retired five years ago. He lives with his wife of 45 years in a rural area. The patient has a 30-pack year smoking history but quit seven years ago. He maintains a diet high in red meat and saturated fats and has a sedentary lifestyle with minimal exercise. He reports moderate alcohol use and denies illicit drug use. There's no family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Past medical history:  1) Chronic hypertension for the past 15 years  controlled with beta-blockers. 2) Diagnosed with high cholesterol three years ago but non-compliant with statins. 3) No history of kidney disease  lung disease  or peripheral artery disease. 4) Overweight with BMI of 29.  Physical examination: 1) Blood pressure is elevated at 155/95. 2) Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass around the umbilicus with a bruit heard over it. 3) Lower extremity pulses were normal. 4) No edema  abdominal bruit  or discoloration of lower extremities were found.  Possible interpretation:  The former smoker  hypertensive  high-cholesterol  and overweight patient presents with severe abdominal and back pain and a palpable abdominal mass  indicative of a possible ruptured or fast expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The absence of physical trauma and history of these risk factors necessitate rapid imaging diagnostics to confirm AAA and rule out other causes like kidney stones  pancreatitis  or diverticulitis. If AAA is confirmed  immediate surgical consultation would be advised.

10,6,21,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial21,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics:   Mr. John is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who lives in an urban area. He is married with 3 adult children. His wife is his primary caregiver. He is a retired banker and has medical insurance which includes coverage for prescription medications. His BMI is 27  indicating he is overweight and has a modestly high risk of cardiovascular disease. He doesn't smoke and drinks alcohol moderately.  Presenting Problem:   John presents with occasional mild abdominal and lower back pain that he rates as a 4 out of 10 for severity. He has noticed the pain off and on for a month.  Past Medical History:  He has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  for which he has been taking medications (beta blockers and statins) for 20 years. John has no known allergies to medications. John has had fluctuating blood pressure readings in the past five years  owing to non-compliance with medications and lifestyle modifications. He has experienced two previous minor cardiac events  with mild angina about ten years ago and a minor stroke event 3 years ago that required no hospitalization. He did not pursue cardiac rehab or physical therapy for these incidents.   Family History:  John's mother died at 65 years due to a myocardial infarction (heart attack)  and his father died at 72 years due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.

He has never been diagnosed with coronary artery disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He has no history of surgeries or known allergies. There is a significant family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father suffering from a myocardial infarction and his brother diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Recently  he has been complaining of intermittent abdominal pain  along with lower back pain for the past weeks. The pain is severe  tearing in nature  and radiates to his back and lower extremities. Accompanying symptoms include weakness  dizziness  and transient episodes of loss of consciousness. There is also a report of unexplained weight loss and diminished appetite over the past months. He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  gastrointestinal symptoms  or urinary symptoms.  Physical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass that is mildly tender on deep palpation. Vitals are stable with mildly elevated blood pressure reading of 145/90 mm of Hg. Lower extremity pulses are diminished bilaterally. The complete blood count  liver function tests  kidney function tests  and coagulation profile results were within the normal range. An ultrasound confirms the presence of an aneurysm in the abdominal aorta  measuring a diameter of 5.5 cm.  Given his age  risk factors  clinical symptoms  findings on physical examination  and results of the ultrasound  Mr. X most likely has an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Considering the size of the aneurysm and presence of symptoms  immediate intervention is required to prevent rupture and life-threatening complications.

Chief Complaint:  John presents with a constant  severe abdominal and back pain that has progressively worsened over the last few hours.  Vital Statistics: Weight: 200 lbs  Height: 6 ft  Lifestyle: John is a retired engineer  who is quite socially active. He smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and has been doing so for the last 40 years. Though his alcohol intake is limited to occasional social drinking.  Family History: John's father had a history of peripheral artery disease and had died of a heart attack in his late 70s.  Past Medical History: John suffers from Type II diabetes and hypertension  both of which are moderately controlled with Metformin and Lisinopril respectively. He also had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from his years of smoking.  Medications: John takes Metformin for type II diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and an inhaler for COPD.  Clinical Presentation: Upon physical examination  a pulsatile mass in the abdomen could be felt. John's blood pressure was elevated  and he appeared distressed because of the pain. His abdominal and back pain appear to be severe and constant  unlike the intermittent claudication he had complained of in previous visits.  Suspected Diagnosis: John’s current symptoms alongside the physical examination findings  his age  persistent smoking habit  and history of hypertension and type II diabetes  point towards a high suspicion of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).

10,6,35,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial35,Problem:  Mr. Smith is a 70-year-old Caucasian male presenting with complaints of abdominal and back pain that has been slowly worsening over the past week  discomfort in his belly  along with nausea and general fatigue. He relates these symptoms to his primary care physician who immediately refers him to a vascular surgeon  suspecting an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Patient's Demographic Details: - Age: 70 years old - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired - Marital status: Married - Education level: College graduate - Living situation: Lives at home with spouse  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith was an active smoker for 25 years but quit 15 years ago. He has a known history of hypertension and atherosclerosis which he manages with antihypertensive medication and statins. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease as his father died from a myocardial infarction in his late 60s. The patient also has a history of mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His last abdominal ultrasound was 3 years ago. In terms of surgeries  he underwent a hernia repair 10 years ago. Other relevant facts include a fairly sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in red meat and fats.  Social History: He drinks alcohol occasionally and quit smoking 15 years ago. Recent stressors could be related to his retirement and some anxiety as his wife was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease.   This AAA suspect problem representation provides a comprehensive view of the patient  considering his age  lifestyle  family history  and individual medical history. Tailored management  including further examination  imaging studies  and possibly surgical intervention  should be initiated promptly to prevent potential rupture of the aneurysm.
10,6,36,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial36,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Demographics: 72-year-old Caucasian male with BMI 27.   Presenting Symptoms: The patient is presenting with a gradual onset of constant lower back and abdominal pain over the past week. Pain intensity is moderate but worsens while lying flat or during physical movement.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension for past 15 years  for which he's been taking antihypertensive medications. There's also a history of hyperlipidemia managed with medication  and a 40 pack-year smoking history  but he has quit smoking ten years ago. No family history of aneurysms. He had myocardial infarction at the age of 60.  Social History: Lives with wife in a suburban setup  had retired from his job as a lawyer  and has a moderate alcohol intake.  Physical examination: Physical examination reveals a positive abdominal pulsating mass and bruit. No signs of peripheral vascular disease were found.   Tests: Blood pressure: 165/90 mmHg  Blood cholesterol: 250 mg/dL  Abdominal ultrasound: saccular bulge of aorta measuring 6 cm in diameter.  Problem Summary:  The patient is a 72-year-old male presenting with symptoms suggestive of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The pain in the lower back and abdomen could be due to aneurysm pressing on nearby organs. Due to the size of 6 cm of the aneurysm in the abdominal aorta  the risk for rupture is increased. Given his high blood pressure  hyperlipidemia  advanced age  and previous smoking history  the patient's overall cardiovascular risk is high.   Chronic hypertension may have contributed to aneurysm development due to strain on arterial walls. Moreover  hyperlipidemia and history of smoking are also known factors for aneurysm development. Hence  these need to be aggressively managed to prevent further complications. The patient should also be evaluated for potential surgical intervention considering the size of the aneurysm.

Physical examination is unremarkable except for a palpable mass in his abdomen that pulses with the heartbeat  and high-pitched systolic bruit over the mass.  These signs are suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Investigations will be needed to confirm the diagnosis and ascertain the size and presence of any potential complications related to the aneurysm. As he is a high-risk patient due to his age  history of smoking and familial history  an immediate evaluation will be required to prevent any fatal ruptures.

10,6,40,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial40,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: Mr. Johnson  a white male of European descent  is 72-year-old retired army officer. His main complaint is a sudden  strong pain radiating from his abdomen to his back and groin  which has been getting progressively worse. He does not report any obvious trauma or injuries as a cause for the discomfort. Mr. Johnson confesses to have been a moderately frequent smoker during his military service and having quit smoking ten years ago. He also admits that his diet is relatively high in fats and sugars  leading to weight gain in recent years.  Medical History: Mr. Johnson's past medical history includes hypertension  diagnosed ten years ago  for which he takes daily medication  and high cholesterol levels  also controlled with medication. There was no evidence of diabetes mellitus  however  his body mass index (BMI) was computed to be 27 (overweight).   Family History:  Mr. Johnson's family history is relevant as his father died due to a stroke at the age of 75 and an older brother has undergone surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 66  and a cousin was identified to have thoracic aneurysm. No family history was reported for diabetes or any rheumatologic diseases.   Recent Observations and Investigations: Upon physical examination  a pulsatile mass was palpated in the abdomen  more prominent than typically found in people of similar age and build. His blood pressure readings were found to be elevated  although this could be a response to pain. Ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a large aneurysm in the lower part of the aorta.  In conclusion  the presented case is a typical demographic profile and history for a patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm  with risk factors including advanced age  male sex  a familial history of arterial aneurysms  hypertension  high cholesterol level  previous smoking  and being overweight.
10,6,41,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial41,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 68 years  Sex: Male Occupation: Retired engineer Marital Status: Married with three adult children Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Residential Area: Urban  lives independently  Presenting Issue:   Mr. Doe has recently been complaining of consistent and worsening abdominal pain that sometimes radiates to his lower back. Along with the pain  he's also experiencing episodes of irregular  rapid heart rates making it challenging to engage in his normal physical activities.   Relevant Past Medical History:  - He's a long-term smoker with a 40-year pack history  which he quit 5 years ago. - He was diagnosed with hypertension 20 years ago  which is controlled with regular medication. - Underwent angioplasty for coronary artery disease 8 years ago. - He has had high cholesterol for the past 10 years managed through diet and statins. - His father passed away from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at 73.  Physical Examination:  A physical examination shows a pulsating mass in his abdomen. His blood pressure readings show normal to high values  while his heart rate is slightly above the normal range. Peripheral pulses are palpable.  Additional Examination:  He is now scheduled for a duplex ultrasound for further investigation. A computed tomography (CT) scan or an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be required depending on the results from the ultrasound.  Risk factors:  Mr. Doe has several risk factors for the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. These include his sex (male)  age (over 65)  his long history of smoking  his family history with his father's ruptured aneurysm  and his history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.
10,6,42,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial42,Patient Representaion  Identification:  Mr. Walters  a 78-year-old Caucasian male presents with complaints suggestive of abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Current Presenting Problem:  Mr. Walters is experiencing occasional abdominal pain that seems to radiate to his back. He reports discomfort which is not unlike a pulsating feeling within his abdomen. No further visible symptoms are present at the moment  there was also no mention of recent weight loss  lower extremity swelling  or visible dilation in the abdomen.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Walters has a documented history of high blood pressure for which he is under medications for the last 15 years. He was a smoker for 40 years but quit smoking 10 years ago. Other notable concerns include a background of peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnosed three years ago and a mild stroke which occurred five years ago. He does not have a history of diabetes  but he does show mildly elevated cholesterol levels from time to time. No familial history of aneurysms.  Social History:  Mr. Walters is a retired engineer who lives with his wife who is his primary caretaker. He reports an occasional alcohol intake but quit smoking approximately 10 years ago. His daily activity includes going for walks  reading books  and gardening. He has adequate familial support from his wife and two children who live nearby.  Medications:  He is currently on 100mg of Losartan for hypertension  Clopidogrel 75mg daily as preventative measure post-stroke  and low-dose aspirin. He is also taking atorvastatin 40mg for his cholesterol problem.  Overview:  Given Mr. Walters' age  history of hypertension and smoking  peripheral artery disease  and the presenting complaint of abdominal and back pain with a pulsating feeling in his abdomen  it is strongly indicative of a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm. This would require confirmatory diagnostic imaging and appropriate medical or surgical intervention  as clinical warranted. This is a high risk and potentially life-threatening condition if left untreated.

10,6,44,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial44,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 72-year-old male  caucasian  former smoker with a 30-pack year smoking history  retired construction worker living independently with spouse with a daily alcohol intake of moderate amount.   Symptomatarium: The patient presents with abdominal and lower back pain that is constant and dull in nature. He reports that this pain has been gradually worsening over the past several days. The pain is generally above the navel and radiates to his back. The patient also reports experiencing a sensation of a pulse in his abdomen.  Relevant Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension that is managed with daily medication (Amlodipine). Additionally  the patient has been diagnosed with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) 10 years ago for which he is on long term aspirin therapy. The patient also reports a family history of aneurysms with his father passing away due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in his late sixties. He underwent chest radiographs last year as a part of his annual evaluation which showed a suggestion of aortic calcification.   Lifestyle Factors: The patient has a history of heavy smoking for the past 35 years  though he quit smoking 5 years ago. He also has a moderate alcohol consumption of about1-2 drinks per day. His occupational history includes a career in construction  which may have exposed him to heavy lifting. He exercises occasionally and reports poor diet habits with a fondness for high-fat foods.   Clinical Indicators: On physical examination  the patient is found to have a palpable abdominal mass that pulses with his heartbeat. His blood pressure is elevated  despite being on medication. Laboratory tests show moderately impaired renal function and mildly elevated inflammatory markers. An abdominal ultrasound has been scheduled.   The above description indicates that the patient presents a typical case of abdominal aortic aneurysm with key risk factors such as old age  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  and family history of the disease. An immediate evaluation including an abdominal ultrasound is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the size and risk of rupture.
10,6,45,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial45,Patient Profile:  Name: Joseph Smith Age: 70 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher Living status: Living with spouse Smoking status: Ex-smoker  quit 15 years ago Alcohol status: Moderate drinker  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension - Diagnosed 15 years ago  on medication (Amlodipine 10mg daily) 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - Diagnosed 10 years ago  controlled with Metformin 3. High cholesterol - Diagnosed 12 years ago  on statins 4. History of smoking for 30 years  quit 15 years ago  Presenting Problem: Patient presents to the hospital for a regular check-up. Upon physical examination  a pulsatile mass was palpated in the mid to upper abdominal area. The patient reports occasional abdominal discomfort  but assumed it was related to gastritis. No nausea  vomiting  severe sharp/stabbing pains  syncope  changes in urinary or bowel habits. He also reports fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion. Another significant finding included a difference in blood pressure between the patient’s arms and legs.  Given the medical history of the patient  the physical examination  and presentation  suspicion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) emerges. This is further supported by the hypertension  high cholesterol  and extensive history of smoking - all of which are known risk factors for AAA. Further diagnostic testing (e.g. ultrasound  CT scan) is required to confirm the presence of AAA and assess its extent. The presence of symptoms such as fatigue and SOB may suggest an impact on the patient’s cardio-pulmonary function. Additionally  this elderly patient’s co-morbidities including diabetes and hypertension further complicate the clinical scenario.

10,6,47,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial47,Patient Problem Representation:  Demographic Information: Mr. Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  is a current smoker with a 40-pack-year history living in the rural Midwest. He consumes alcoholic beverages moderately  usually drinking beer two to three times a week.  Presenting Symptoms: He presents with occasional  mild  lower abdominal pain that radiates to his lower back  which over time has been slowly worsening.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a documented history of hypertension  for which he takes Lisinopril. His BMI is 28.1  indicating that he is overweight. He also has high cholesterol and is on Atorvastatin. His father died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in his mid-70s  and thus he has a familial predisposition to aneurysms.   One remarkable detail is that he pursued medical attention only for the shortness of breath he started experiencing last week  attributing his abdominal/back pain to his old age.   Lifestyle: Mr. Smith lives with his wife in their farmhouse and leads a semi-active lifestyle  managing their small farm. Primarily  he has been ignoring his health and avoiding routine medical check-ups.  Problem List: 1. Current smoker with significant pack year history of 40. 2. Hypertension. 3. High cholesterol levels. 4. Overweight (BMI of 28.1). 5. Family history of AAA. 6. Mild to moderate pain in the lower abdomen  radiating to the back. 7. Recently developed shortness of breath. 8. Avoidance of regular health check-ups.   Summary Mr. Smith is an older male with major risk factors for AAA such as a smoking history  hypertension  high BMI  and familial predisposition.

Presenting Issue:  He presents to the clinic with a complaint of a pulsating feeling in his abdomen  which has progressively increased over the last months. He does not complain of any acute abdominal pain or back pain but has mentioned episodes of lightheadedness. There's no history of loss of consciousness  chest pain or shortness of breath.   Past Medical History:  Mr. A.B has a significant 20-year history of hypertension and has been diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia for the last ten years  both of them under pharmacological control. He also has a 40 pack-year smoking history  but quit smoking about 5 years ago. He has no known allergies. There has been no previous surgery or hospital admissions in his history.  Family History: His father died at the age of 75 with 'heart problems'  but no further details are known. He also has a brother who underwent surgery for an aneurysm in his stomach  i.e.  abdomen aortic aneurysm at around the same age.    Social History: He lives with his wife  is a non-alcoholic  quit smoking 5 years back. He does not indulge in any form of regular exercise. His diet is high in saturated fat  with little to no inclusion of fruits or vegetables.  This 72-year-old male patient with a significant smoking history along with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  presenting with pulsating abdomen and lightheadedness  could potentially be suffering from an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm also makes him at increased risk. Note that often patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms present with no symptoms  and it is found incidentally  so the symptom of a pulsating sensation in his abdomen serves as a significant finding.
10,6,51,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial51,Problem Representation:  Patient is a 71-year-old Caucasian male  retired truck driver  who presents with a 2-day history of a pulsing  sharp and severe lower abdominal pain. Associated symptoms include lightheadedness  cold  clammy skin  and rapid heartbeat. He has a history of smoking from age 20 until 65 (approximately 45 pack-years) and a high-fat diet with limited physical exercise. The patient has been diagnosed with high blood pressure and hypercholesterolemia  and has been noncompliant with his prescribed antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications. His family history is significant for abdominal aortic aneurysms (father died at the age of 78 due to aortic aneurysm rupture). On physical examination  he appears anxious and diaphoretic. Palpation of abdomen reveals a pulsatile mass in the midline of the abdomen  just below the xiphoid process.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension diagnosed 8 years ago  noncompliant with antihypertensive medication. 2. Hypercholesterolemia diagnosed 5 years ago  noncompliant with statins. 3. Tobacco use disorder: heavy smoker from age 20 until 65. 4. Unhealthy diet: patient follows a high-fat diet  regular intake of fast food  low intake of fiber  fruits and vegetables. 5.

He has been an active smoker with about 40-pack year smoking history and reports moderate weekly alcohol consumption.  Presenting Complaint: The patient has been feeling unexplained  vague lower abdominal and back pain intermittently for the last few months  but the pain has slightly increased in the last few days. He also notes unintentional weight loss over the last six months.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels that he controls with medication and diet. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting fifteen years ago. His father died at the age of 65 due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and his older brother had an elective repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 70.  Other Relevant History: The patient is a former marathon runner but has put on significant weight over the last 20 years. He denies any history of diabetes  stroke  or kidney disease. The patient is compliant with his annual medical evaluations and laboratory checks  but he has missed his last two appointments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He has no known drug allergies.   Social History: The patient has been smoking for the past 45 years  averaging a pack a day  and drinks alcohol socially  approximately six drinks per week.

He eats a balanced diet  but confesses to indulging in fast food and desserts more often since his retirement.  Medication: The patient is currently on an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) for hypertension and a statin (atorvastatin) for hyperlipidemia.  Considerations: Given the patient's age  gender  family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm and personal history of smoking  hypertension and hyperlipidemia  the patient is at significant risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His recent symptoms of abdominal and back pain could further suggest the presence of an aneurysm. Therefore  a thorough physical examination and appropriate imaging should be performed to investigate this possibility and determine if immediate clinical intervention is required.

Medical History:  His personal medical history is significant for hypertension under control with medication  hyperlipidemia  and Type 2 Diabetes mellitus controlled through diet and medication. No prior surgeries reported. He doesn't report any allergies. Family medical history includes a brother who passed away from aortic aneurysm rupture at the age of 60.  Evaluation:  The physical exam  in general  does not produce any abnormal results other than a palpable mass in the abdomen and a soft systolic murmur. His vital signs upon arrival are stable. The patient is alert  oriented and his neurological assessment is normal.   To confirm the suspicions  he's referred for an ultrasound - aortic duplex. The ultrasound confirms the presence of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a diameter of 4.5 cm. Blood test results indicate normal complete blood count but elevated blood sugar levels.  Current Medication:  - Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension - Metformin 500mg twice daily for type 2 diabetes - Atorvastatin 10mg daily for hyperlipidemia  Conclusion:  The patient is asymptomatic AAA  and the diameter is less than the threshold for surgery (5.5cm). Because of his personal and familial history and risk factors - male  age  high blood pressure  smoker and Type 2 diabetes  he is closely monitored for any changes in the size of the AAA. He will continue his current medications and advised on strict glycemic control. Regular ultrasounds at intervals depending on any change in symptoms is planned. He is educated about the symptoms of a potentially rupturing aneurysm and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if he experiences intense back or abdominal pain.

10,6,78,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial78,Demographic Information:  Mr. Peter Hanson is a 72-year-old retired Caucasian male. He lives in a suburban area with his wife of 48 years. He is a former smoker with a long term smoking history of more than 30 years (1950-1980). He also has a history of excessive alcohol consumption but he has quit alcohol for the last ten years. He has been exposed to stressful work environment with no physical activity throughout his young age and middle age. He is a non-vegetarian with occasional indulgence of fast-food and he has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 28 which is indicative of his overweight.  Past Medical History: Mr. Hanson has a significant past medical history including hypertension for 20 years  high cholesterol for 15 years and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for the past 10 years. As per his medical reports  his hypertension and high cholesterol have been inadequately controlled. He was treated previously for angina  5 years ago.   Family History: There is a relevant family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). His father passed away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 60 and his mother had a stroke at the age of 70.  Presenting Complaints:  For the past few months  Mr. Hanson has been experiencing sporadic episodes of abdominal pain  particularly after having meals  that radiates to his lower back. He also feels a pulsing sensation in his abdomen akin to a heartbeat. He also mentions occasional lightheadedness.   Based on available medical and family history  population demographics  and presenting symptoms  there is a suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in Mr. Hanson. He belongs to a demographic group (older  male  smoker) that is typically at a higher risk for AAA  making this a plausible diagnosis.
10,6,79,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial79,Problem Representation:  Patient profile:  - John  a 70-year-old  Caucasian male who is a long-time smoker  presents himself to the hospital.  - Currently lives in an urban setting with his wife  retired  has 3 children  and 5 grandchildren. - Past medical history includes hypertension for the last 20 years  moderately controlled with medication. - Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage 3) for 10 years. - Has hyperlipidemia for 18 years  managed with lifestyle modifications and medication.  Problem:  - Over the past few weeks  John has experienced intermittent episodes of abdominal pain and a pulsating sensation in his abdomen. - Symptoms also include occasional low back pain and unintentional weight loss.  - On physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpated. - On the basis of the symptoms and physical findings  an initial diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm was suspected.  Medical Management:  - John was immediately referred for an abdominal ultrasound  which confirmed the diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. - The aneurysm measures 5.6 cm in diameter. - Due to the size of the aneurysm and the associated risks of rupture  John will likely need to undergo surgical repair  specifically an endovascular aortic repair procedure. - The risks associated with the surgery were explained to John and his wife  primarily the chances of Mirizzi's syndrome and myocardial infarction due to his hypertension and smoking history. - He was also urged to quit smoking and to consistently take his blood pressure and lipid-lowering medication. - Follow-ups and monitoring of his aneurysm and overall health were also advised.  Highlights:   - Age  gender  and the smoking habit combined with his longstanding hypertension and hyperlipidemia make John a high-risk individual for the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. - John's chronic kidney disease may also influence his treatment options and potential for recovery from the surgery. - The pulsatile abdominal mass and unexplained back pain are key clinical features  which clue into the diagnosis of this condition. - The relatively large size of the aneurysm means that surgical intervention will be required to prevent the aneurysm from rupturing  which could result in life-threatening internal bleeding. - Frequent medical follow-up and maintaining healthy lifestyle adjustments are going to be crucial for his prognosis post-surgery.

He also has a known history of hypertension which has been fairly well controlled over the last 10 years with regular medications. There is also a noteworthy history of aneurysm-related deaths in the family. Recently  the patient reported experiencing an intermittent dull aching pain in the mid-abdominal area.  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: The patient was diagnosed with high blood pressure 10 years ago. He is currently on antihypertensive medications. 2. Hyperlipidemia: He also has elevated blood cholesterol levels and is on statins to control it. 3. Smoking: The patient has a significant smoking history which has been ongoing for the past 40 years. 4. Family History: The patient has a strong family history of aneurysms  with both his father and elder brother succumbing to ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms.  Current Presentation: The patient has been experiencing an intermittent dull aching pain in the middle and lower areas of his abdomen for the past month. The pain seems to radiate to his lower back. He also reported experiencing occasional episodes of severe pain that feel similar to a tearing or ripping sensation.   Overall  these characteristics suggest a high risk for the possibility of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient's age  gender  smoking history  hypertension  and his family history of aneurysms collectively contribute to this risk profile. Given the current symptoms he is experiencing  a diagnostic evaluation should be quickly pursued to confirm the condition.

Physical Exam: On physical examination  the provider identifies a pulsatile abdominal mass. Distension in the abdomen and a palpable abdominal mass are present. Auscultation reveals a bruit over the mass. Both lower limbs are cold  with weak peripheral pulses.  Based on his age  history of smoking  family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm  history of hypertension  and physical examination findings  the patient is suspected of having an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further investigations including ultrasound  CT scan and possible referral to a vascular surgeon are warranted.
10,6,82,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial82,Problem Representation:   Patient Profile: A 70-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Complaint: The patient reports intermittent episodes of moderate to severe abdominal pain and lower back pain over the past few weeks.   History of Presenting Complaint: Patient describes the abdominal pain as a deep  pulsating sensation that's persistent most of the day. The pain seems to radiate to his lower back and sometimes to the groin. He sometimes notices a feeling of fullness in the abdomen. There's no relation to food consumption or physical activity.  Past Medical History: History of hypertension controlled with medication (Lisinopril) and hyperlipidemia managed with Atorvastatin. He has a 35-pack year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. His father passed away secondary to a ruptured aortic aneurysm in his 60s. No history of diabetes mellitus or ischemic heart disease.   Social History:  He is a retired engineer  lives with his wife  and is independent with his activities of daily living. He doesn't consume alcohol and is a non-drinker.  Clinical Assessment:  Physical examination reveals a pulsatile mass in the abdomen upon palpation. His blood pressure is controlled and the rest of the vital signs are within normal limits. The initial impression based on his complaints  family  personal and medical histories suggest the possibility of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.     Investigation Plan: A possible abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) would necessitate further diagnostic evaluations such as ultrasounds  computed tomography (CT)  or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to confirm the diagnosis and assess the size and location of the aneurysm. Routine blood tests would also be recommended to help understand the overall health of the patient.   Management Plan:  The management plan would be determined by the size and growth rate of the aneurysm. Small or slow-growing AAA's usually require careful monitoring and management of blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Large or fast-growing AAA's may need surgical intervention to prevent rupture. The patient will require lifestyle modifications including a healthy diet to control his blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Consider referral for smoking cessation if the patient resumes smoking.
10,6,83,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial83,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 70 years old Gender: Male Job: Retired engineer Residence: Urban setting Ethnicity: Caucasian Blood Group: B positive Marital Status: Married  Medical History:  The patient has been diagnosed with a 3.8 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) on routine cardiovascular check-up. He reports occasional mild abdominal discomfort  but minimal other relevant symptoms. The aneurysm appears fusiform in shape on ultrasound.   Patient has a significant past medical history of: - Chronic hypertension  diagnosed 15 years ago  - Moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  diagnosed 8 years ago with irregular compliance to medication  - Smoker for 50 years  20 cigarettes/day (50 pack years)  - Hyperlipidemia  diagnosed 7 years ago  - History of angina pectoris  diagnosed 4 years ago.  Family History:  Mother died at 71 due to stroke; Father had a history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm and died at the age of 72 due to its rupture. No siblings. One son  healthy.  Lifestyle: Poor diet high in salt and fats and sedentary lifestyle. Recent attempt at introducing light exercise with walking in the park.  Current Medications:  1. Amlodipine 10mg for hypertension 2. Salbutamol inhaler for COPD 3. Atorvastatin 20mg for hyperlipidemia 4. Aspirin 75mg for angina pectoris  The above medications are provided as once daily. Patient's compliance to medication regime is not optimal  with frequent missed dosages.   Allergies: Penicillin.  Social Exposures: No significant social exposures - Patient lives with wife. No pets. No recent travel history. Minimal alcohol use with consumption of occasional glass of wine.   Given his significant family history and risk factors of smoking  age  and chronic hypertension  this puts him at high risk for continued expansion of the AAA.   This discovery dictates close supervision and further management  including possible intervention if the aneurysm expands to ≥5 cm. The primary goal will be to manage cardiovascular risk factors in hope to avert aneurysmal rupture.
10,6,84,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial84,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Gender: Male  - Age: 70 years old - Occupation: Retired  ex-smoker for last 15 years after smoking for about 30 years - BMI: 32 (Obese)  Medical History: - Hypertension: Diagnosed 20 years ago  under management with medications - Hyperlipidemia: Treated with statins for the past 10 years - Family history: Father died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 78  Presenting Chief Complaints: - Episodic abdominal pain  - Lower back pain  - Noticeable pulsation in the abdomen  Physical Examination: - Abdominal palpitation reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass 4cm in diameter. - No visible signs of peripheral vascular disease.  Probable Diagnosis: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Rationale: Given the age  gender  history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  family history  obesity and the physical examination findings of abdominal/back pain with palpable abdominal mass  the suspicion of abdominal aortic aneurysm is high.   Investigation Plan: - Ultrasonography/computed tomography angiography to confirm the presence  location  and size of the aneurysm.  Management Plan: - If the AAA is small (less than 5.5cm) and asymptomatic  it could be managed conservatively - regular monitoring of the AAA size  controlling blood pressure  and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. - If the AAA is large (greater than 5.5cm)  symptomatic  or growing rapidly  surgical intervention may be recommended  either via open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). - Address modifiable risk factors – continuation of hypertension and hyperlipidemia management  advising against smoking  and guiding on weight management.
10,6,85,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial85,Patient Profile: Patient X is a 67-year-old Caucasian male presenting with intermittent abdominal pain over the past few weeks. The pain is characterized as a deep  gnawing pain that seems to radiate towards his back. Patient X reports that he hasn’t experienced any changes in his bowel habits  and hasn't noticed any blood in his stool. His past medical history reveals long-standing uncontrolled hypertension and a 45-pack-year history of smoking. In addition  he has a familial history of vascular diseases  his father having died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture.  Medical History: - Hypertension: Diagnosed 15 years ago  patient under treatment but poorly controlled. - Smoking: Heavy smoker for 30 years  averaging 1.5 packs per day (45 pack-years)  still ongoing. - Family History: Father died from AAA rupture at 70  no siblings with known AAA. - Others: No history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or other cardiovascular diseases. - Medications: Taking anti-hypertensive medications irregularly. - Allergies: No known drug allergies.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient is of average build  alert but appears slightly anxious. Blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg  and pulse is 80 bpm and regular. An examination of the abdomen reveals a pulsatile mass. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable  and the patient is afebrile.  This patient's age  gender  smoking history  uncontrolled hypertension  and family history of AAA put him at a high risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass in the patient's abdomen should prompt immediate further investigation  such as ultrasound or computed tomography angiography (CTA)  for possible AAA. The intermittent abdominal and back pain experienced by the patient could suggest that the AAA is expanding  increasing the risk of rupture  which can be a life-threatening condition. Therefore  urgent evaluation and management should be carried out. 
10,6,86,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial86,Patient Problem Description:  Patient Information: The patient is a 69-year old male of Caucasian descent.  Presenting Problem: Our patient came into the emergency room reporting severe pain in the middle of his abdomen and back. The pain is described as a steady  gnawing sensation that has been getting progressively worse.  Medical History: The patient has a documented history of hypertension and high cholesterol. He is a long-term smoker with a 45 pack-year history. He has been taking medication for these conditions but he is inconsistent in his compliance to prescribed therapy. There is a history of familial abdominal aortic aneurysm - his father died from a ruptured AAA when he was in his early 70s.  Social History: Our patient is a retired carpenter  living alone. His wife passed away a few years back. He has two adult daughters who live out of state but visit often. The patient admits to a sedentary lifestyle since his retirement with few activities apart from watching TV and doing a bit of gardening.  Examination Findings: On examination  a pulsatile mass can be felt in his abdomen which doesn’t move with respiration. The patient has a blood pressure of 158/92 mmHg and a pulse rate of 78 bpm.  Imaging Reports: Ultrasound findings confirm an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a maximal diameter of 5.5 cm  suggesting that it is large enough to warrant intervention.  The patient's past medical history  along with his age  gender  heavy smoking  hypertension and a familial history of AAA places him at higher risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass  symptomatic abdominal pain and ultrasound reports align with AAA diagnosis. The prompt management approach is indicated in light of his clinical history and presentation.
10,6,87,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial87,Problem Representation:  Patient: John Doe  Demography: A 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  hailing from a semi-urban region. He has a history of smoking about a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years  although he quit 7 years ago. He has a typical diet  with a fondness for meats and minimal intake of fruits and vegetables. His BMI is 28. He does light exercises  such as walking  and avoids heavy physical activity due to age-related joint stiffness.   Past Medical History: Has been on antihypertensive medication for 18 years for managing chronic hypertension and he is compliant with his medication regimen. He was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) 10 years ago. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stenting 8 years ago for the significant occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). He is presently maintained on dual antiplatelet therapy for CAD.  Family History: The patient's father died of stroke at 79 and his mother died of colon cancer at 75. His older sister  74  is currently living with type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is no known family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms.  Current History: Reports a sudden onset of severe abdominal and back pain (described as a tearing sensation)  he also has been experiencing progressive abdominal bloating and discomfort for the past few months. However  this acute pain has been constant and severe for the past few hours.   Physical Examination: On examination  he appears distressed with the pain. His blood pressure is elevated (160/92 mm Hg) with a pulse rate of 86 beats/min. Palpation reveals a pulsatile mass in the mid-abdominal area.   Current Impression: Considering the heavy tobacco use history  the chronic burden of hypertension and coronary artery disease  and the acute onset of abdominal and back pain with a pulsatile mass on examination  an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is suspicious and should be immediately ruled out.  Immediate Management: A prompt referral for abdominal ultrasonography to confirm the diagnosis  followed by CT angiography if needed  is vital. General surgery/emergency medicine consultation might be needed for probable surgical repair depending on the size and symptoms of the aneurysm. Also  pain control and blood pressure management should be optimized urgently.    This problem representation could vary depending on specific patient characteristics and clinical findings.

The patient maintains a relatively sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activities.  Family History: Father passed away at the age of 83 from a myocardial infarction. Mother passed away at the age of 90 from natural causes. He has an older brother with peripheral vascular disease and a younger sister with no significant medical issues.   Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension 20 years ago  which is controlled with medication (amlodipine 5 mg daily). 2. Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed 15 years ago  currently managed using statin therapy (Atorvastatin 20 mg daily). 3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed with T2DM 10 years ago and is currently managed with Metformin 1000 mg twice daily.  Current Problem: The patient has recently presented to the emergency department with a sudden  severe pain in the lower abdomen and back. This has not occurred before  and the pain was not associated with foods or movements. The patient reported feeling lightheaded  and pulse was rapid at the time. Based on the clinical picture and quickly performed ultrasound  the patient was diagnosed with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient also presented with slightly lower extremity edema and a pulsating mass in the upper middle abdominal area.   Impression: The patient's age  gender  hypertension  smoking history  and familial history suggest a high risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms. The sudden onset of severe abdominal and back pain coupled with hemodynamic instability is characteristic of a ruptured aneurysm  a life-threatening condition requiring immediate surgical intervention. The presence of lower extremity edema further indicates compromised vascular perfusion  likely secondary to the ruptured AAA."

10,6,96,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial96,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired truck driver  with a history of smoking  presents with abdominal pain and a pulsating sensation in the stomach area. He lives alone and has occasional alcohol intake. He is physically inactive and generally feels fatigued most of the time.  Medical History: - Active smoker for about 50 years. - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) diagnosed 10 years ago  on intensive therapy  and requires home oxygen. - Hypertension diagnosed 15 years ago  poorly controlled  on antihypertensive medication. - Hyperlipidemia diagnosed seven years ago  on statin therapy with inconsistent medication adherence. - History of mild renal insufficiency. - Has a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). His father died of a ruptured AAA. - He has had no surgeries or allergies. - Recently had unexplained significant weight loss.  Examinations: On examination  he appears anxious and pale. His blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg and his pulse rate is irregular at 85 bpm. There is a palpable and pulsatile mass in the patient’s mid to lower abdomen. His peripheral pulses are intact. On abdominal auscultation  a bruit over the mass was noticed.  Abdominal ultrasonography revealed an infrarenal AAA of 5.5 cm in maximum diameter.   Problem List: 1. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (5.5 cm diameter) with symptoms of abdominal pain and a pulsating sensation in the stomach. 2. Uncontrolled hypertension. 3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. 4. Hyperlipidemia with inconsistent adherence to statin therapy. 5. History of heavy smoking. 6. Mild renal insufficiency. 7. Unexplained significant weight loss.  8. High-risk family history of AAA  with father's fatal rupture.   Psychosocial Issues: 1. Poor compliance to medications. 2. Potential lack of social support from living alone.   Prognosis: The patient's overall prognosis is complicated by his age and complicated medical history. Owing to the size of the aneurysm and the patient's symptoms  the risk of rupture is high. This  along with the patient's COPD and hypertension  elevates the risk of perioperative mortality and morbidity. Therefore  careful surgical planning and risk management are required.

10,6,99,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial99,Patient Representation:  Demographic Information: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male named John  who resides in Brooklyn  NY living with his wife. He is a retired truck driver and has three adult children. He is a former heavy smoker with a 40-pack per year history but quit smoking 10 years ago. He rarely drinks alcohol and consumes a diet moderately high in fat.  Presenting Problem: John has come to the emergency department at the local hospital with the chief complaint of severe  sudden-onset lower-back and abdominal pain  which he rates as 10 out of 10 on the pain scale. He reports the pain came on suddenly while finishing his daily morning walk.  Past Medical History: Significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia (both factors that contribute to atherosclerosis)  and a history of claudication with exercise for which he has been seeing the local vascular surgeon. His medication list includes amlodipine for hypertension  atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia  and an 81 mg aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. He has a family history of cardiovascular problems with his father dying from a myocardial infarction in his 70s and his brother having a history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Past Surgical History: John's past surgical history is relatively unremarkable. His only surgery was a cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) 15 years ago following a diagnosis of gallstones.   Psychosocial History: John is a lifelong resident of Brooklyn  NY where he worked as a truck driver until retirement at 65. He has been married for over 40 years and has a supportive network of family and friends. John is a non-practicing Roman Catholic. He does not have any history of drug use and seldom consumes alcohol.   Potential Problem: Given his sudden severe abdominal and back pain  history of claudication  significant family history  and risk factors of age  male gender  smoking history  and hyperlipidemia  there is a high index of suspicion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) - a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. An AAA might be enlarging or leaking which can lead to a fatal rupture if not treated promptly. The pain he experienced could be a sign that the aneurysm is about to rupture.
10,6,100,diagnosis10-prompt6-trial100,Problem Representation:  Patient Information: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired military officer  residing in the suburban area. He is a former smoker with a 40-pack year history and quit 15 years ago. He has no known drug allergies.   Chief Complaint:  He presents with intermittent abdominal and lower back pain which he has been experiencing for the past couple of months.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant past medical history of moderate hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both well-controlled with medications (Lisinopril 10mg daily  Simvastatin 20mg daily). He was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and hyperlipidemia about 7 years ago.   Family History:  He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases - his father had a myocardial infarction at 65  and a maternal uncle died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm.  Review of Systems:  He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  changes in bowel or bladder function  or any neurological symptoms. He also denies any recent weight loss or night sweats.  Sexual/Reproductive History: The patient has been married for 50 years  has had no other sexual partners.  Travel  Social and Environment History: His alcohol consumption is approximately 3-4 standard drinks per week and he does not use any illicit drugs. He denies any recent travel or changes in dietary habits.  Medications: He takes 10mg Lisinopril daily for hypertension and 20mg Simvastatin daily for hyperlipidemia.  Physical Findings on Examination: Initial vital signs are stable. On physical exam  he has a pulsatile abdominal mass that is slightly tender to palpation. There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy or peripheral edema.  Pathogenic Factors: History of smoking predisposes the patient to atherosclerosis and consequently aortic aneurysm. Age and male gender also contribute to a higher risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms. Furthermore  the patient’s family history makes him genetically predisposed to cardiovascular diseases  including aortic aneurysm.   Hence  the aforementioned cues and patient history point towards a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further diagnostic testing including abdominal ultrasound or CT angiogram is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.
10,7,1,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial1,Case Report: Large Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-year-old Male  I. Demographic Information Patient Initials: JB  Age: 68  Gender: Male  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired engineer  II. Reason for Reporting: A 68-year-old man presented to the emergency department with complaints of intense abdominal pain. He has been diagnosed with a large abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  III. Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  each of which has been controlled for the past 10 years with lifestyle modifications (dietary changes and exercise) and oral medications. He quit smoking 15 years ago  but had a 30-pack year history. His father died of an aneurysm  type unknown  at the age of 55.  IV. Physical Exam Findings: Upon physical examination  his Blood Pressure was measured at 154/98 mm Hg and his heart rate was 102 beats per minute. He reported severe  constant pain in his lower back that radiated to his groin  making his legs feel weak. His abdomen was soft but with a palpable pulsating mass in the mid-epigastric region. There was tenderness on palpation in the region as well.  V. Diagnostic Tests & Results: The patient underwent abdominal ultrasonography  which indicated the existence of a 7.0 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. Additionally  an abdominal CT scan was performed to confirm the diagnosis and plan for surgical intervention. The CT scan corroborated the findings from the ultrasound and also revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen  suggesting imminent rupture. Hematological and biochemical investigations were otherwise normal.  VI. Clinical Course: Due to an imminent risk of rupture  the patient was quickly prepared for emergency endovascular aortic repair (EVAR)  rather than open repair due to his overall health and comorbidity status  and as per the consensus with the patient and his family. He underwent successful surgery  with stent placement and was kept under close monitoring. Post-surgery  he showed significant improvement and was discharged ten days later. He was referred for follow-up visits and monitoring at intervals of 1  3  6  and 12 months post-discharge.   VII. Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition and intervention in managing large abdominal aortic aneurysms to prevent life-threatening outcomes. It manifests the role of unspecific symptoms in potential vascular catastrophes and guides the requirement of good medical history for risk strata identification and timely intervention. The patient's family history of aneurysms and his lifestyle conditions made him vulnerable to AAA. Though faced with the problem at a severe stage  timely and appropriate diagnosis and surgical management helped the patient turn toward a regular lifestyle post-discharge.

Medical History: Mr. X is a former smoker with a history of hypertensive and hyperlipidemia conditions. He quit smoking ten years ago after a 30-year smoking history. There is no family history of heart disease or aneurysms. He has been prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (for hypertension) and statins (for hyperlipidemia). Mr. X is not diabetes and does not suffer from any other known disorders.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. X sought medical advice due to persistent abdominal and lower back discomfort  which arose over the previous two weeks. Moreover  he felt a throbbing sensation in his abdominal region  which intensified gradually.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  a pulsating abdominal mass was detected  and a bruit was heard upon auscultation. Mr. X's blood pressure measured 160/95 mmHg  and his BMI was within normal range. Blood tests revealed elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.  Diagnostic Assessment: Following the initial assessment  Mr. X underwent ultrasonography  revealing an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further evaluation by computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed a 5.7 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with no signs of rupture.  Therapeutic Intervention: Mr. X was immediately referred to vascular surgery. He underwent elective open surgical repair  and the postoperative course was uneventful. The excised aneurysm was sent for histopathological evaluation.   Follow-up and Outcomes: Due to the successful surgery  there was significant symptom reduction. Mr. X was discharged with ongoing drug therapy to treat his hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Regular follow-ups  including ultrasound examinations every six months  have been proposed to ensure no recurrence or development of new aneurysms. Two weeks after surgery  Mr. X reported a significant decrease in abdominal pain.  Patient Perspective: Mr. X expressed relief  having undergone successful surgery. He recognized the seriousness of his condition and understood the need for regular follow-up consultations and lifestyle modifications for maintaining his health.  Informed Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the significance of regular follow-up and monitoring of high-risk patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  as well as those people with a history of smoking. The case also illustrates the subtlety with which an abdominal aortic aneurysm can present  reinforcing the importance for physicians to consider this potentially fatal condition in patients presenting with abdominal or back pain.
10,7,3,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial3,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-year-old Caucasian Male  Patient Profile The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history relevant for Type II Diabetes mellitus  Hypertension  Hyperlipidemia  and coronary artery disease. He has a history of smoking - two packs of cigarettes per day for 40 years before quitting ten years ago. The patient also has a history of mild alcohol intake. He is currently on medications including Metformin  Lisinopril  Simvastatin  and Aspirin. He lives with his wife  has three grown children  and he is a retired carpenter.  Presenting Complaint  The patient presented in the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of severe abdominal pain  radiating to his back and lasting for several hours. The pain was sudden  severe and constant. The patient mentioned he has been feeling abdominal fullness for few days but thought it might be due to indigestion. He also reports feeling dizzy and sweaty but denied chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  loss of consciousness  nausea  or vomiting.   Clinical Findings On physical examination  the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Abdomen was non-tender  distended with a notable pulsatile mass in the middle and lower part of his abdomen. Following initial examination  an emergency abdominal ultrasound was performed which showed a 6 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. Subsequently  a CT angiogram was obtained for detailed anatomy review which confirmed the diagnosis of a 6.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with no sign of rupture and no renal artery involvement.   Discussion The patient was diagnosed with a large abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a life-threatening condition  requiring immediate surgical intervention. Given the patient's past medical history and smoking history  he falls into the common demographic for an aneurysm which is typically seen in Caucasian men  over the age of 60 with cardiovascular and pulmonary issues or those who have a history of smoking.   Treatment Following discussion with the vascular surgeon and anesthesiologist  and considering the size of the aneurysm and its impending rupture  an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was performed.   Conclusion The operation was successful without complications and the patient's post-operative period was uneventful. He was discharged from the hospital in stable condition with follow-up visits arranged with the vascular surgery outpatient clinic. This case emphasizes the importance of considering abdominal aortic aneurysm in the differential diagnosis in older patients with abdominal pain  especially in those with risk factors such as hypertension  smoking and hyperlipidemia.
10,7,4,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial4,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 65-Year-old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an asymptomatic  potentially fatal condition that commonly affects older adults. This report presents the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presented with AAA.  Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  living in the midwestern United States. He is a retired truck driver who spent a significant portion of his career driving long distances  leading a sedentary lifestyle. He is a current smoker with a 40-pack per year history and consumes moderate amounts of alcohol regularly. He is obese (BMI  31 kg/m2) and has a family history of vascular diseases. The patient lives with his wife and has a regular but not varied diet.  Clinical Findings:  The patient reported to the outpatient department with mild abdominal discomfort that had been persisting for two weeks. The pain was non-radiating and constant  rather than intermittent  with no associated symptoms such as fever  chills  nausea  vomiting  or changes in bowel habits. There was no history of black tarry stools or hematemesis suggestive of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Physical Examination of the abdomen revealed a palpable  pulsatile mass. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of an AAA measuring 5.5cm in maximum anterior-posterior diameter which suggested an impending rupture. Laboratory test results unveiled mildly elevated serum cholesterol  triglyceride levels  and C-reactive protein.   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient underwent an urgent endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) procedure  which was uneventful. His postoperative period was marked by a brief hospital stay in the surgical intensive care unit. He received appropriate postoperative care  including analgesics for pain management  and antibiotics to minimize infection risk.   Follow up and outcomes:  Upon sequential follow-ups  it was observed that the patient was recovering well. He was free of abdominal pain and other associated symptoms. Repeat abdominal ultrasound after three months revealed no leakage or expansion of the repaired aneurysm.   The patient has been further counseled on the importance of lifestyle modification which includes quitting smoking  adopting a balanced diet to control his weight and lipids level. He was also encouraged to engage in moderate-intensity physical activities like walking or swimming.   Discussion: This case underscores the significance of early detection and immediate intervention in AAA  especially among high-risk populations to improve the prognosis. Patient education for lifestyle modification could play a vital role in preventing the expansion or rupture of AAA.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed relief with the resolution of abdominal discomfort and was determined to adhere to the lifestyle modifications suggested. The patient also understood the importance of routine follow-ups to monitor his recovery.
10,7,5,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial5,Title: Acute Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 67-Year-Old Male with a Medical History of Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia  Introduction:  This case presents Mr. L  a 67-year-old Caucasian male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  who was referred to the emergency department due to sudden onset of severe lower back and abdominal pain.  Demographic Information:  Mr. L is a retired engineer who lives with his wife in rural Pennsylvania. He has a 35-year history of smoking  drinking alcohol occasionally  and no known drug allergies. His regular medications include amlodipine for hypertension and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He has no history of surgeries or prior hospitalizations. His family history is notable  with his father having died of a heart attack at the age of 70 and his mother of stroke at age of 80.   Clinical Findings:  On examination  Mr. L was visibly in distress  sweating profusely with a notably distended abdomen. His vital signs revealed a beating heart rate of 110 beats/min  blood pressure 160/90mmHg  respiratory rate 22 breaths/min  and an oxygen saturation of 95% while breathing ambient air. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsating mass in the mid-abdomen region and a systolic bruit. Lower limb pulses were symmetrical  and there was no sign of limb ischemia.  Diagnostic Assessment:  With suspicion of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  we performed an urgent computed tomography (CT) scan. It confirmed an infrarenal aortic aneurysm of 7.5 cm in diameter. Furthermore  evidence of a mural thrombus was seen without signs of active rupture.  Therapeutic Intervention:  After discussing the CT findings and available treatment options with Mr. L and his family  he was immediately prepped for emergency open repair surgery. During the surgery  the aneurysm was exposed through a trans-peritoneal approach and a prosthetic (Dacron) graft was successfully placed. The postoperative period was uneventful and he was discharged home a week later on appropriate medications.  Follow-Up & Outcomes:  At a six months follow-up  Mr. L was doing well and had managed to quit smoking. An ultrasound at that time showed no signs of aneurysm recurrence.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of considering AAA in any elder patient with hypertension history presenting with severe abdominal or back pain. Also  it stresses the crucial role of CT imaging in the prompt diagnosis and management of potentially life-threatening AAA. Furthermore  this report underscores the value of post-surgery lifestyle modification counseling in minimizing future cardiovascular risks.  Authors: [Author's Name] and team  Date:  [date]
10,7,6,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial6,"Patient Introduction:   Mr. A is a 68-year-old Caucasian male from the rural suburbs. He is a retired farmer with a medical history of hypertension  Hyperlipidemia  and a 45 pack-year smoking history. He quit smoking 5 years ago upon a diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). He stands 5'10"""" tall and weighs 85kgs  putting his BMI at 26.6  considered overweight. He drinks occasionally  and denies any history of illicit drug use.  Chief Complaint and History of Present Illness:  He presented to the clinic with a chief complaint of progressively worsening and persistent abdominal and lower back pain for the last two weeks. He also reported occasional dizziness and a feeling of """"fullness"""" in the abdomen  particularly after meals. He denied any chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  changes in bowel or bladder habits  unexplained weight loss  or fever.  Family History:  Reportedly  his father had a history of cardiovascular disease and died of a myocardial infarction. His mother had diabetes  and a younger sister survived breast cancer. There has been no known history of peripheral vascular disease or aneurysms in the family.   Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  Mr. A's vital signs were within normal limits. He appeared mildly discomforted due to pain. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile and tender mass in the peri-umbilical area  more noticeable on deep palpation. The rest of the physical examination  including the cardiovascular  respiratory  and musculoskeletal systems  was unremarkable.  Investigations:  Lab results indicated a slight anemia (Hb 11.2 g/dL) and mildly raised inflammatory markers (CRP 20 mg/L). Liver and kidney function tests were within normal parameters.   An abdominal ultrasound showed a 5.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. The findings were confirmed by a contrast-enhanced CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis showing an saccular aortic aneurysm with mild mural thrombus  without any signs of rupture or dissection.  Management:  Given the size of the aneurysm and the patient's symptoms  he was counselled for urgent surgical intervention. He underwent an elective open surgical repair of the abdominal aortic aneurysm  with placement of a Dacron graft  performed by the vascular surgery team. The procedure went smoothly  without any complications.  Follow Up:  Postoperatively  he was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit initially and then moved to the ward. His postoperative recovery was uneventful  and follow-up ultrasound at one week and then at one month showed no complications. He was advised to attend regular follow-ups and was referred to a smoking cessation and cardiac rehabilitation program.   Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of recognizing the aortic aneurysm symptoms and the crucial role of primary care providers in the timely referral for surgical intervention. Given the patient's risk factors  including age  hypertension  and a significant smoking history  an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan should be considered if they present with persistent abdominal or back pain  particularly if a pulsatile abdominal mass is detected on examination.

The pain was described as a sharp tearing sensation  radiating to the back. The patient also noted mild shortness of breath but denied symptoms of chest pain  palpitations  syncope  nausea  vomiting  or lower limb weakness.   Examination & Investigation: Upon examination  the patient was found to be alert and oriented but appeared in significant distress due to pain. Vital signs were notable for tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute and blood pressure of 170/85 mmHg. There was a palpable abdominal mass with systolic pulsation. No bruits were discernable.   An immediate contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered  which revealed a 7.5cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with evidence of rupturing.   Management: The patient was immediately admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring and preparation for emergency surgical repair. Given the rupture risk and patient's distressing pain  endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was promptly executed after hemodynamic stabilization.   Post-operation  the patient was stable. He was discharged on post-op day 7 with prescriptions for pain medication and follow-up appointments with the vascular surgery team.  Follow-up: At three-month follow-up  a repeat CT scan demonstrated successful aneurysm exclusion and no endoleak. The patient was advised to continue regularly monitoring and follow-up sinography for his aneurysm.  This case underscores the importance of immediate assessment and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm to avoid life-threatening complications. It also emphasizes the role of effective long-term surveillance post-repair to identify any complications at the earliest. Future directions include an emphasis on smoking cessation and atherosclerotic risk factor reduction  consistent with guidelines for aneurysm management.
10,7,8,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial8,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)   Patient: Male  68 years old  Caucasian  retired teacher  resides in New Orleans  Louisiana with his spouse.   Presenting Complaint:  The patient was referred to our vascular clinic for a routine checkup  following incidental detection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) on a lumbar spine MRI performed for chronic back pain evaluation. He complained of no other symptoms and appeared generally well.  Clinical History:  The patient’s medical history is noteworthy for hypertension  diagnosed eight years ago  and for which he has been on treatment (Amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide) with fair control. He also has a ten-year history of type-2 diabetes mellitus  managed with oral hypoglycemic agents (metformin). There is no history of heart disease or stroke. The patient has not had any previous surgeries.   He has quit smoking four years ago  after a 40-year long smoking history and denies alcohol abuse. He is a known case of hyperlipidemia for the past five years and is on statin therapy.  Clinical Examination:  Physical examination of the abdomen revealed a pulsatile mass just above the umbilicus. No bruits were heard on auscultation over the mass. The rest of the body examination was unremarkable.  Investigation:  Confirmatory diagnosis was made by abdominal ultrasonography which revealed an infra-renal AAA  measuring 5.5 cm in diameter. No sign of impending rupture was noticed. Subsequent CT angiogram provided similar results  while also ruling out the potential for aneurysm extension into the iliac vessels.  Management and Discussion:  The patient was counseled about the risks and benefits of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open surgery for AAA. Considering the patient's age  comorbidities and the size of the aneurysm  he was scheduled for an elective EVAR. The procedure was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day three.  Regular follow-up will be crucial for our patient to monitor for potential complications including endoleak  graft migration  aneurysm enlargement  or rupture. Moreover  the patient needs to adhere to his ongoing treatment for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes  as these comorbidities can adversely affect the prognosis.  The case emphasizes the importance of routine health checks and imaging  which can lead to the incidental diagnosis of potentially critical conditions like AAA  particularly in population groups at higher risk  such as older  male patients with a history of smoking  hypertension and atherosclerosis.

He has been a habitual smoker for over 60 years and has a record of moderate alcohol consumption. His occupation  pre-retirement  was a long-time construction worker.  Medical History: Mr. X has a significant medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he has been taking angiotensin receptor blockers and statins  respectively  for the past ten years. He also has a history of ischemic heart disease and underwent stent placement 5 years back. There hasn't been any significant surgical history apart from the stent procedure. He doesn't have any known allergies.  Presenting Problem: Mr. X presented to the emergency department with severe on-going abdominal and lower back pain  which started about 2 hours ago  along with signs of acute distress. No prior episode of such pain was mentioned during the medical history recording. He was pale  clammy  with cold extremities and showing signs of shock.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  his blood pressure was 85/50 mmHg with a pulse rate of 105 beats per minute. A pulsatile abdominal mass was felt on palpation  accompanied by tenderness. Labs revealed a decreased hematocrit and mild hyperkalemia.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation  severe pain  hypotension  and presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass  the preliminary diagnosis was a suspected ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). This suspicion was confirmed by an urgent CT angiogram which revealed a large infrarenal AAA with evidence of rupture.  Treatment Course: Mr. X was expeditiously transferred to the operating room after initial resuscitation with crystalloid fluids. An emergency open aortic repair was successfully performed to exclude the aneurysm.  Outcome: The patient made a steady recovery in the intensive care unit post-operatively. He was discharged after 14 days without any marked postoperative complications.  Prognosis: He was advised to continue his antihypertensive and statin medication  quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption. He was scheduled for regular follow-ups  as patients with a history of AAA have an increased risk of developing thoracic aortic aneurysms.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of immediate recognition and rapid resuscitation before definitive surgical repair for ruptured AAA cases. Despite the high mortality rate  early diagnosis and prompt treatment could result in favorable patient outcomes and survival as successful in Mr. X's case.

He is a non-smoker and moderate alcohol drinker. He worked in his field for over 40 years with possible exposure to asbestos. His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases including his father who died of myocardial infarction and a paternal uncle who had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Clinical Presentation:  Mr. Jones presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset  sharp  and continuous lower back pain of 5 hours duration. The pain was 8 out of 10 in severity and radiated to both lower extremities. He also reported a pulsating sensation in his abdominal area  but denied any recent trauma  nausea  vomiting  or changes in bowel habits.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  his vitals were stable: blood pressure 155/90 mmHg  pulse rate: 82/min  respiratory rate: 24/min  body temperature: 98.6°F. Abdominal examination revealed a tender  pulsating mass located in the central and upper area of the abdomen. All peripheral pulses were equally palpable bilaterally.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Given the clinical presentation and physical examination signs  an emergent abdomen and pelvic CT scan was ordered which confirmed the presence of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6.5cm.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient underwent emergent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  given the size and symptomatic presentation of his AAA. He tolerated the procedure well and his postoperative course in the ICU was uneventful.  Follow Up:  Mr. Jones was discharged after 1-week post-surgery with scheduled vascular surgeon appointments for the next 6 months  and annual surveillance thereafter. We also recommended lifestyle modifications including daily moderate exercise  low salt diet  and regular monitoring of blood pressure.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough examination for early detection of abdominal aortic aneurysms. As with Mr. Jones  many cases may be detected during evaluation for unrelated issues or during routine physical examination. This may lead to early and timely intervention  potentially saving lives. Due to Mr. Jones's family history of AAA and his occupational exposure to asbestos—both risk factors for development of AAA—it would be prudent to have alerted his primary care physician for earlier surveillance.
10,7,22,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial22,Patient Information: Mr. M  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented with intermittent  dull abdominal pain radiating to his lower back. The patient has a history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day for 45 years (90-pack/year)  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He denies ever having diabetes or cardiovascular problems. He lives alone and is a retired factory worker.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient had mild hypertension (150/90 mmHg). He was afebrile with a heart rate of 82 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Abdominal exam revealed a pulsatile mass in the mid-abdominal region. There were no signs of peripheral arterial disease. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment: Due to examination findings  an abdominal ultrasound (US) was ordered. The US revealed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 5.5 cm in diameter  with intraluminal thrombus. Blood work showed elevated lipids and slightly reduced hemoglobin; however  no signs of infection or kidney impairment were evident.  Therapeutic Intervention: Following the diagnosis  he was referred to a vascular surgeon. After considering the patient’s age  symptomatology  aneurysm size  and overall health status (including smoking status and controlled hypertension)  the patient was deemed suitable for an elective open repair surgery. The patient consented to the procedure once the risks and benefits were properly explained to him.  Follow Up: The patient underwent successful open aortic repair. He was monitored in the intensive care unit post-operatively and subsequently transferred to the regular floor on post-operative day 2. His post-operative recovery was smooth with good pain control and initiation of ambulation on the first post-operative day. The patient was discharged from the hospital on post-operative day 7  and a follow-up appointment was arranged with the vascular surgery team in six weeks.  Patient Perspective: The patient was relieved to have survived the operation without any major complications. He recognized the importance of cessation of his smoking habits and was motivated to take part in a smoking cessation program.  Clinical Pearls: This case underscores the importance of meticulous physical examination and appropriate referral to a vascular surgeon upon suspicion of AAA. The condition heavily associates with smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  emphasizing the necessity for early detection  lifestyle modification  and elective repair option to mitigate mortality risks.

10,7,25,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial25,Patient Information  Mr. Santos  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  was living in New York and having a routine life  working as an accountant at a local firm before retirement. He is a non-smoker and was a moderate consumer of alcohol up until 2 years back  which he gave up upon advice from his attending physician. His family history is notable for cardiovascular diseases  his father and grandfather both having passed away from heart-related conditions.  Presenting Issue  Mr. Santos presented to the emergency department with an intense  sharp pain in the middle of the abdomen that radiates to the lower back region. The pain appeared suddenly and he reported it as the most severe he's ever experienced. He also reported an intermittent feeling of fullness in the abdomen and slight shortness of breath.  Clinical Findings  Clinical examination and ultrasound revealed an abdominal mass which was pulsating. A CT scan confirmed the existence of a 5.5 cm infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Apart from mild hypertension  Mr. Santos was hitherto unaware of any significant health problem.  Past Medical History  Mr. Santos's past medical history includes controlled hypertension  for which he's been on medication for the past 5 years. He was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia 8 years back and is under medication. He has no known allergies. His weight is within a healthy range with a BMI 24 mirroring his controlled diet and moderate physical activity.  Therapeutic Intervention  Given the size of the aneurysm and the severe  sudden onset pain  emergent surgical intervention in the form of open repair was undertaken. A graft was successfully placed across the aneurysm. Hospital stay was uneventful.  Follow-up  Upon discharge  Mr. Santos was advised to continue his medication for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Regular follow-ups and scans were suggested to monitor the graft and any potential development of new aneurysms. Lifestyle changes were recommended including maintaining a healthy diet  regular exercises  controlling blood pressure  and cholesterol levels. Staying informed about the signs of an AAA rupture was emphasized  and the patient was urged to seek immediate emergency care if such symptoms occurred in the future.  Conclusion  AAA does not show any symptoms often until rupture. Given Mr. Santos's family history of cardiovascular disorders  routine screenings may have unveiled the developing aneurysm earlier. This case underlines the importance of reaching out to symptomatic individuals  especially those with familial predisposition and educating them about the condition. Condition awareness  routine screenings  immediate response to symptoms  and regular follow-ups post-treatment  play significant roles in managing abdominal aortic aneurysm.
10,7,26,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial26,"Title: Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 64-Year-Old Male  Introduction:   Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is often a silent and potentially fatal condition characterized by a dilated segment of the aorta in the abdomen most often secondary to atherosclerosis. Here  we report a case of a AAA in a 64-year-old man.   Case Presentation:   The patient  a 64-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with intermittent  sudden-onset  severe sharp pain in the lower abdomen and back that had begun 24 hours prior. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" and rated it as 8 out of 10 on the pain scale. The patient had a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking (30 pack years).   Physical examination recorded blood pressure at 120/80 mmHg  heart rate of 88/min  respiratory rate of 18/min and temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass  but there were no signs of peritonitis. There was no distension  bowel sounds were normoactive  and there were no signs of digital clubbing  cyanosis  or edema.   Investigations:   Laboratory tests showed normal complete blood count and creatinine but raised D-dimers (800 ng/mL). Electrocardiography indicated normal sinus rhythm. An ultrasound showed a 7 cm infrarenal AAA without evidence of rupture but with intramural thrombus.  Management and Follow-up:   The patient was immediately transported to the operating room  where an emergent endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) was performed successfully without complications. Following surgery  he was started on beta-blockers  statins  and antiplatelet therapy. The patient remained stable postoperatively and was discharged after one week.   At the three-month follow-up  a CT scan showed the aneurysm's successful exclusion and no endoleak. The patient reported a significant decrease in abdominal pain and improvement in his general condition.  Discussion:   This case report underscores the necessity of maintaining a high level of suspicion for AAA even in patients with non-specific abdominal and lower back pain  especially in the presence of risk factors such as age  male gender  smoking  and a history of hypertension. Our patient was properly and promptly managed due to early diagnosis  potentially averting a catastrophic rupture.  Conclusion:  AAA should not be overlooked in differential diagnoses in patients with risk factors particularly due to its high mortality rate in case of rupture. Early detection  via a simple screening tool like ultrasound for high-risk patients  should be promoted."

10,7,30,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial30,Title: Long-standing Undetected Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 62-year-old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Introduction:   Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) refers to the localized enlargement of the abdominal aorta exceeding the normal diameter by more than 50 percent. It is generally asymptomatic until it ruptures  leading to high mortality rates.  Case Presentation:   A 62-year-old Caucasian man presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe abdominal pain. The patient was a life-long smoker and a known sufferer of hypertension  high cholesterol levels and obesity. He also had a family history of AAA  where his father had died of a ruptured AAA.  Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  the patient showed signs of severe pain and discomfort. His blood pressure was noted as 160/100 mmHg and his heart rate was 95 beats per minute. There was marked pulsatile mass in the epigastric region. Significant tenderness had been observed in the bilateral renal angle area. Initial laboratory test results showed a high C-reactive protein  slightly elevated white blood cell count and abnormal coagulation profiles.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  An urgent abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of a large AAA measuring 7 cm in maximum diameter. A CT angiography was also done which revealed a large infrarenal AAA with signs of impending rupture.   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was urgently transferred to the vascular surgical unit and underwent an emergent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Post-surgery  the patient’s blood pressure and heart rate were continuously monitored. A follow-up CT angiography was conducted after three days  revealing no endoleak and confirming the success of the intervention.  Follow-up and Outcome:  On follow-up four weeks later  the patient reported resolution of the abdominal pain. He had stopped smoking and had been on regular follow-ups with a cardiologist to manage his hypertension and high cholesterol levels.

10,7,34,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial34,Patient Case Report  Introduction  This case report discusses the management of a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a diagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Patient Information  The patient is a retired auto mechanic. His past medical history includes hypertension and a 20-year history of smoking a pack of cigarettes per day  from which he quit 7 years ago. His family history is notable for cardiovascular disease; his father passed away at 62 following a myocardial infarction. He is currently on antihypertensive medication  specifically Beta-adrenergic blocking agents  and he follows a balanced diet. He has no known drug allergies.  Clinical Findings   The patient initially reported to the clinic with complaints of nonspecific lower abdominal and lower back discomfort that he had been experiencing for the past 3 weeks. He initially dismissed these discomforts as normal signs of aging. However  when the pain became intense and constant over time  he decided to seek medical attention.  Diagnostic Assessment   Physical examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the patient's abdomen. Furthermore  an abdominal ultrasound was conducted which revealed a 5.8 cm fusiform aneurysm in the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta  consistent with an AAA. No echolucent area was found suggestive of free rupturing. There were no clinical indications of renal or visceral ischemia.  Therapeutic Intervention  Based on the size of the aneurysm and the patient's overall health status  surgical management was decided upon. An open surgical repair was performed which involved clamping the aorta  opening the aneurysm  and suturing in a synthetic graft to replace the diseased portion of the aorta. The surgery was successful and without complications.   Follow-up and Outcomes  Postoperatively  the patient had an uneventful course and was discharged on the 10th day after surgery. The patient was advised to stop smoking entirely and to adhere to the prescribed medication regimen to control his blood pressure. Regular follow-up every six months was recommended to monitor the graft and the patient's overall vascular health.  Patient Perspective  The patient expressed gratitude for the detection and treatment of the aneurysm  stating that he did not realize the seriousness of the condition until it was explained to him by the medical team. He emphasized his commitment to the postoperative care plan in hopes of preventing further vascular complications.  Informed Consent  Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.  Conclusion  This case highlights the importance of early detection and management of AAA  particularly in patients with a history of hypertension and smoking  as these are known risk factors. The case already presented as a large aneurysm  which could have been life-threatening if not promptly treated. Regular physical examination and screening in at-risk populations can potentially lead to early detection and better outcomes for AAA patients.

He also has Type II diabetes for the past 15 years and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Mr. A had no history of cardiovascular disease but his father had cirrhosis of the liver and died of aneurysm rupture at 70.   Examination and Tests: On examination  his vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 145/85 mmHg. On palpation  there was a pulsating mass in the mid-abdominal region  which raised suspicion for an AAA. His lab results revealed slightly elevated blood sugar levels and otherwise normal CBC  lipid profile  renal and liver function tests. An ensuing ultrasound and abdominal Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) confirmed a presence of a 5.5 cm infrarenal AAA.  Management: Patient was promptly referred to vascular surgery for potential endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) to avoid the risk of rupture. After counseling about the benefits and risks of the procedure  the patient agreed to have EVAR.   Outcomes and Follow-up: The intervention was successful and the patient reported a dramatic decrease in lower back pain and abdominal discomfort. He was discharged after five days. Follow-up after four weeks showed a stable state of the aneurysm (4.9cm). The patient was advised a healthy lifestyle  regular exercise  tobacco-alcohol cessation  medication adherence  and to have regular check-ups.  Discussion: This case illustrates the importance of considering a diagnosis of AAA for older patients presenting with unexplained lower back or abdominal pain. Patient's advanced age  smoking history  hypertension  PAD  and family history of AAA contributed to the high index of suspicion. Early diagnosis and prompt management were crucial to prevent fatal complications.  Conclusion: Although AAA is often asymptomatic until rupture  careful examination  knowledge of risk factors  and a high index of suspicion  can lead to early diagnosis and successful management. Health professionals should also emphasize the importance of lifestyle modifications in controlling the risk factors associated with the disease. 
10,7,36,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial36,Patient Details: Name: Anonymous Age: 68 years Sex: Male Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting Problem: The patient was referred to the Emergency Department because of persistent abdominal and back pain for a last couple of weeks. The pain was noticed to be intense especially after having meals. He also reported loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  which is well-managed through anti-hypertensive medication. He has a 30-year history of smoking  about one pack per day  although he quit 5 years ago. In one of the previous routine check-ups 3 years ago  the patient was identified with early signs of atherosclerosis. He also has hyperlipidemia which is managed with statins. There is no history of any surgery. His father died due to a heart attack at the age of 58.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  a prominent pulsating mass was noticed in the abdomen. The physical examination showed his blood pressure to be 145/90 mmHg  pulse rate 78/min  respiratory rate 18/min  and body temperature 37.2 °C. A cardiovascular exam revealed no other abnormalities. All other systemic examinations were found to be normal.  Investigations: Abdominal ultrasonography was ordered which revealed a large aneurysm in the abdominal aorta. This result prompted the prescription of a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan. This confirmed the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  measuring approximately 6.5cm in diameter. There was no sign of rupture or leakage  but the size suggested that the risk was high.   Diagnosis: Based on the clinical history  physical examination  and investigations  the patient was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Treatment: Given the size of the aneurysm  surgical repair was indicated. The patient was treated with an endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) procedure successfully. His systolic blood pressure was gradually brought down under 130 mmHg over a couple of days to reduce the pressure on the aorta.  Patient Education & Follow-Up: The patient was educated about the relationship of abdominal aortic aneurysm with hypertension  lifestyle  and diet. A follow-up was scheduled for two weeks later for wound check and to manage hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has also been referred for a smoking cessation program. Long term  he will have regular follow-ups to monitor for any potential complications related to the EVAR and the aneurysm.  In conclusion  this patient’s condition was successfully managed but he would require long-term follow-up due to the nature of his medical conditions and potential complications related to his AAA and EVAR.

He has a history of high blood pressure  tobacco consumption (around 40 pack-years)  and moderate alcohol drinking habits. The patient lives alone and is engaged in light physical labor work post-retirement. He doesn't have any known allergies but is on medication for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus under control for the past five years.  Clinical Findings  On physical examination  the patient appeared pale and diaphoretic but was in no apparent distress. He was conscious  oriented with a pulse rate of 100 beats/minute  blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile midline mass of about 5 cm in diameter with epigastric tenderness but no signs of discoloration or erythema.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment  Laboratory tests including complete blood count  kidney function  liver function  and electrolytes were within normal limits except higher levels of white blood cells suggesting possible infection. The duplex ultrasound helped to locate the aneurysm and establish its size  revealing a large infrarenal aortic aneurysm of 7.9 cm in diameter with signs of rupture. Contrast CT angiography further confirmed these findings and indicated the need for immediate surgery given the size and the presence of pain  which may indicate impending rupture.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment  An emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) procedure was performed  which involved placing a stent graft within the aneurysm to provide a permanent alternative conduit for blood flow  excluding the aneurysmal sac from blood pressure  thereby preventing rupture. The surgery was successful with no signs of endoleak or graft infection.  Follow-up and Current status  The patient was discharged after a week in a stable condition with advice to completely quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption  and monitoring his condition through regular follow-up visits. Encouraged to consistently monitor his blood pressure and take his diabetic and hypertension medications regularly. He was also educated about the signs of aneurysm complications like sudden severe pain  fainting  rapid heartbeat  or dizziness  and to immediately seek medical care if any such symptoms arise. On his six-month follow-up appointment  he has reported no complications  his hygiene and dietary adjustments were appreciable  and follow-up imaging showed no signs of an aneurysm.  Conclusion  The case illustrates the importance of considering abdominal aortic aneurysm in older patients presenting with a pulsatile midline mass and risk factors such as smoking and hypertension. Early diagnosis and intervention can save lives especially in the case of an asymptomatic or rupturing abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further  it emphasizes the need for post-discharge health lifestyle education in these patients.

10,7,46,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial46,Title: Emergent Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 65-Year-Old Non-Smoking Male with a History of Hypertension  Case Report:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  who presented with severe  persistent abdominal pain. He has no history of smoking or diabetes but has chronic hypertension since age 50. He does not have any familial history of cardiovascular diseases  but his father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He denied substance use  over-the-counter medication use  or having any allergies. The patient works as a school teacher and is sedentary with minimal physical activities.  The initial evaluation revealed a blood pressure of 170/95 mmHg while the patient's regular medication Lisinopril was ineffective in controlling the systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg. No significant weight loss  fever  or illicit drug use was noted.  Physical examination identified a pulsatile abdominal mass in the periumbilical region which was suspicious of an aneurysm. The patient appeared to be distressed from the continuous systemic pain. Other system examinations were unremarkable.  Laboratory tests showed mild leukocytosis  but his kidney function  liver enzymes  and electrolytes were all within normal limits. Lipid profile results showed borderline-high LDL levels.  A CT angiogram of the abdomen revealed a fusiform aneurysm located in the infra-renal area of the abdominal aorta with a maximum diameter of 6.5 cm  extending to both iliac arteries. The Aortic aneurysm was seen to be partially thrombosed and was accompanied by signs of rupture. No other visceral or peripheral vascular diseases were identified.  Given the size and clinical suspicion of impending rupture mirrored in patient's excruciating pain  vascular surgery was consulted  and an emergent open repair of the abdominal aortic aneurysm was advised and performed. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate or post-operative complications.  This case underscores the importance of regular follow-ups  diligent monitoring of medication effects  and high suspicion for AAA in hypertensive patients and those with family histories of AAA. The patient's severe uncontrollable hypertension could have been a clue towards an undiagnosed AAA. The case reflects the practice of high clinical suspicion in patients with high-risk factors  which could potentially lead to early diagnosis and management  thereby decreasing mortality and morbidity associated with ruptured AAA.

Presenting Problem:  Mr. G.S. came to the emergency department with a sudden onset severe abdominal pain that began approximately five hours before presenting  describing it as a tearing sensation. He also reported that the pain seemed to radiate to his lower back.  Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  a pulsatile mass was palpable in the periumbilical area  indicating a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). His blood pressure was found to be 150/90 mm Hg  and his heart rate was 98 bpm. He appeared anxious and reported feeling faint.   Diagnostic Assessment:  An emergency abdominal ultrasound revealed a 7.5cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis and showed a large transverse aneurysm on the left side of the aorta with evidence of a leak  creating an urgency for surgical intervention.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Due to the large size of the aneurysm and the symptoms presented  an immediate endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was performed without complications. He was kept under intensive care postoperatively and closely monitored to ensure no additional leakage or complications from the surgery.  Outcome and Follow-Up:  Post-operative recovery went smoothly  with his abdominal pain significantly subsiding. Regular follow-up and monitoring of the aneurysm with repeated imaging confirmed success in preventing aneurysm rupture. Mr. G.S. was discharged on postoperative day 6 with close outpatient follow-up scheduled.  Lifestyle changes have been strongly advised  especially to quit smoking.  Learning Points:  Early diagnosis and intervention in the case of an abdominal aortic aneurysm can significantly reduce the risk of rupture and subsequent mortality. Risk factors such as smoking  high cholesterol  hypertension  and a family history of heart disease contributed to the condition and re-educating the patient on lifestyle management can drastically improve prognosis.

He is a retired manual labor worker  a widower living alone  and is currently assisted by a home nurse for his ADLs (Activity of Daily Living).   Presenting Complaints: The patient was initially presented for an annual general health check-up without any specific complaints. Clinical examination was generally unremarkable. Blood pressure was normal regime at 120/80 mmHg  temperature was 98.7⁰F  with a regular pulse rate and rhythm.  Previous Medical History: The patient has a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both well-controlled with medication. Furthermore  he is a former smoker  having quit smoking 15 years ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally and has no known allergies.   Investigations and Findings: Routine blood test and urinalysis results were within normal limits. However  during an abdominal ultrasound performed due to an unrelated possible gallbladder disease  a large aneurysmal dilation of the abdominal aorta was incidentally discovered. Computed tomography (CT) confirmed the findings  revealing a 5.6 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Considerations of Risk Factors: Given his medical history  age  and previous smoking habits  the patient can be considered as a high-risk patient for an aneurysmal rupture.   Management and Follow-up: Discussions regarding surgical interventions were had due to the size of the aneurysm. Aortic aneurysm repair surgery was deemed a valid option  however  due to the age and frailty of the patient  endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was the elected strategy. The patient was to be monitored closely for any signs of aneurysm expansion or rupture.  Outcome: The patient underwent endovascular aortic repair without immediate complications  and has since been on continuous follow up schedules. He was recommended to maintain his antihypertensive and anti-diabetic regimen and to abstain from smoking and alcohol.  This case emphasizes the importance of regular health check-ups in the geriatric population  especially those with a history of smoking and hypertension  for early diagnosis and management of asymptomatic large abdominal aortic aneurysms.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  conditions largely identified as risk factors for AAA.  CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with a primary complaint of severe lower back pain radiating to the abdomen for the past 48 hours. The patient also reported recent unexplained weight loss and a decrease in appetite.   His past medical history includes hypertension  well controlled with Lisinopril  and hyperlipidemia  managed with Atorvastatin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years. He showed no previous record of major surgical procedures or any allergies. He does not consume alcohol and has no family history of aneurysms or heart diseases.   On physical examination  he appeared mildly distressed with a blood pressure of 166/98 mm Hg  heart rate of 102 beats per minute  and respiratory rate at 19 breaths per minute. The patient had a pulsatile abdominal mass approximately 5cm in diameter. His skin color appeared normal  and he had no visible skin lesions or injuries. His neurological examination was within normal limits with no signs of central or peripheral neurological deficits. Laboratory tests including complete blood count  renal function tests  and electrolyte panel were within normal limits.   Radiographic Assessment with an abdominal ultrasound showed a 5.3 cm infrarenal AAA with no signs of rupture. No other abnormalities were noted during the ultrasound assessment.   DISCUSSION: The combination of the patient's history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking habit  age  and the physical examination finding of a pulsatile abdominal mass led to the suspicion and subsequent diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm following an ultrasound scan.   The patient's high-risk features such as the size of aneurysm and severe symptoms led to the decision to undertake immediate surgical intervention. The patient underwent endovascular aortic repair (EVAR)  which was successful with no complications. He was then started on a beta-blocker therapy to control his blood pressure and reduce the risk of possible aortic rupture in the future.  He was advised to continue his current medications  quit smoking  adopt a healthy diet and engage in regular exercise. The patient was also scheduled for a regular follow-up appointment for monitoring and further management of his health condition.  CONCLUSION: This case enlightens the significance of recognizing risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and habitual smoking in the early detection and management of AAA. Timely detection of AAA and immediate surgical intervention can potentially save life. It also emphasizes the importance of lifestyle changes  regular monitoring and follow-up in the management of AAA.

The pain was ranked 8/10 in intensity  was not alleviated by resting or positional changes  and was accompanied by a feeling of faintness. His past medical history included hypertension  high cholesterol levels  and atherosclerosis  with a ten-year history of smoking (quit 15 years ago). There was no known family history of heart or vascular diseases.  Clinical Examination:  The patient's pulse was rapid and weak  with a palpable abdominal mass noted on physical examination. The patient's blood pressure was relatively low at 90/60 mmHg  and there were signs of peripheral hypoperfusion. The abdomen was tender  particularly in the central and lower region.  Investigations:  Ultrasound imaging of the abdomen revealed a large aneurysm in the abdominal aorta  measuring approximately 8.1 cm in diameter. Subsequent CT angiography confirmed the presence of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with no apparent rupture  but there were signs of impending rupture due to the size and rapid expansion. Blood tests revealed an elevated white blood cell count  indicative of a possible inflammation or infection.  Treatment and Outcome:  Considering the patient's age  co-morbidities and the size of the aneurysm  an emergency endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) was performed successfully. His pain decreased significantly post-procedure  and his hemodynamic status remained stable. The patient was transferred to ICU for critical care monitoring during the immediate postoperative period.  At the 1-month follow-up  the patient reported no pain and there was no evidence of endoleak on follow-up ultrasound. His blood pressure was better controlled with medications  and he was advised on lifestyle modifications  including diet  exercise  and regular follow-ups to monitor his vascular status.  Discussion:  This case underscores the importance of considering an abdominal aortic aneurysm in the differential diagnosis when an elderly patient presents with unexplained severe abdominal pain  especially in conjunction with a history of vascular diseases and other risk factors such as smoking.

10,7,56,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial56,Patient Information  Mr. Troy  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department at around 9:45 PM with symptoms of severe lower back pain and shortness of breath. Besides  he also reported a pulsating sensation in his abdomen and was mildly feverish. His ethnic origin is of Irish-American descent and he lives with his wife in a suburban region. His primary language is English.   Past Medical History  As per available medical records  Mr. Troy has a history of hypertension and he is a former smoker (40 years pack history) having quit around 10 years back. Further in the past  there were incidental findings of a small (3.5 cm) infrarenal abdominal aorta aneurysm  that was being monitored conservatively. His family history indicates that his late father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm  that was successfully surgically repaired. The patient had been prescribed medications for controlling blood pressure  including a beta-blocker and an ACE-inhibitor. His hypertension was typically well-controlled on these medications  although he admitted that he had been non-compliant in taking the medications over the last week.  Clinical Findings  Upon physical examination  he appeared to be in significant discomfort. His blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg  and his heart rate was faster at 110 beats per minute. His body mass index was 27  falling in the overweight range. There was evidence of a pulsatile mass in his abdomen  and there was tenderness localized to the mid and lower abdomen.  Diagnostic Assessment  A contrast CT scan confirmed the presence of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. The size of the aneurysm had enlarged significantly to 8 cm. Unfortunately  evidence of a contained rupture with retroperitoneal hematoma was also observed.   Therapeutic Intervention  Emergent surgical repair was planned and informed consent for open repair versus endovascular aneurysm repair was obtained. The patient elected to undergo an endovascular procedure  guided by his age and the possibility of quicker recovery time.   Patient Follow-up  Postoperatively  the patient was closely monitored in the Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure control  potential renal damage  and lower extremity ischemia. No such complications were encountered. By Day 3  he reported significant improvement in his symptoms and his vital signs were also much-improved. To prevent further cardiovascular complications  the patient was counseled on the importance of compliance with medications  maintaining low sodium diet and moderate aerobic exercise. On follow-up visits at 1 month  3 months  and 6 months  the patient remained symptom-free and the size of the aneurysm remained stable.   In conclusion  this case emphasized the importance of adherence to prescribed medications in hypertensive patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm and that a high index of suspicion needs to be maintained in patients with a history presenting with acute abdominal or back pain. 
10,7,57,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial57,Patient Identifier: Case-001-AA Demographics: 68-year-old Caucasian male Medical History: A known hypertensive on medication for the past 10 years. Has a history of smoking (30 pack years) but quit 5 years ago. Reported a family history of cardiovascular diseases.   PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset of severe abdominal and back pain which he described as tearing in nature since morning. The pain was not relieved with over-the-counter pain medications. He denied chest pain  shortness of breath  dizziness  or loss of consciousness.  CLINICAL FINDINGS:  On physical examination  the patient appeared in acute distress related to pain. Vital signs showed blood pressure of 180/100mmHg  pulse rate 110/min  temperature 98.5 degrees Fahrenheit  and respiratory rate of 22/min. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the midline of the abdomen.   No signs of limb ischemia or neurologic deficit were noted. Rectal examination was normal. Laboratory tests revealed normal kidney function and complete blood count. Electrocardiogram showed no signs of myocardial infarction or arrhythmia.  INVESTIGATION AND MANAGEMENT:  Given the clinical suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  the patient underwent an urgent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen  which confirmed a 7.5cm infrarenal AAA with evidence of impending rupture.  Emergency surgical consultation was obtained  and the patient was urgently transferred to the operating room for an open surgical repair. A Dacron tube graft was placed without complications. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 after confirming graft patency via duplex ultrasonography.  DISCUSSION:  This case represents a classic presentation of an impending rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm in a patient with a background of hypertension and smoking. AAA is often asymptomatic until rupture or threatened rupture occurs. In such instances  open surgical repair or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are the primary treatment options. The patient's clinical presentation and CT findings dictated the urgency of surgical intervention.   KEY LEARNINGS:  Emergency physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for AAA in older patients presenting with abdominal or back pain  especially with known risk factors like hypertension  smoking  and male sex. Prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention can be life-saving.   It highlights the importance of screening programs for AAA in high-risk populations to aid early diagnosis and intervention before disastrous consequences like rupture occur. Such programs have demonstrated a significant reduction in AAA-related mortality rates over the last decade.

Assessment and Diagnosis:  On physical examination  the patient was alert and oriented but showcased significant discomfort. His vitals showed a blood pressure of 160/95 mm Hg  a pulse of 90 beats per min  and a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per min. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the mid-abdominal region  and he exhibited tenderness on palpation. Bowel sounds were normal with no signs of peritonitis. Peripheral pulses were palpable and equal bilaterally.  Radiology performed a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan. The study revealed a large abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6.8 cm in maximum diameter  beginning just below the renal arteries and ending just above the aortic bifurcation  confirming the suspected diagnosis.  The patient was also subjected to a complete blood count  renal function test  coagulation profile  and lipid profile  which were mostly within normal ranges  except the lipid profile  showing higher than normal levels. Given his symptomatic presentation and the large size of the aneurysm detected  the patient's case was considered for urgent surgical repair  and the vascular surgery team was consulted for emergency intervention.  Surgical Management:  The patient underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Postoperatively  he recovered well with close monitoring in the cardiovascular intensive care unit. The patient was discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation center on postoperative day seven.  In conclusion  this case underlines the clinical importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms given the patient's significant risk factors and symptomatic presentation. Despite his complex past medical history  successful surgical repair was performed  highlighting that emergency intervention can be life-saving in these acutely presenting patient scenarios. 
10,7,62,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial62,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 60-Year-Old Male   Patient Information: A 60-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  presented with complaints of severe low back pain radiating towards the lower abdomen. He is a resident of the local area and resides with his wife. He had a 35-year history of smoking (quit 1 year ago) and is an occasional drinker. He has never been diagnosed with diabetes or hypertension  but his father suffered from cardiovascular disease.  Clinical Findings: The patient’s blood pressure was 145/95 mmHg  heart rate was 90 beats per minute  respiration rate was 16 breaths per minute  and body temperature was 36.7°C. Physical examination revealed that the patient was in discomfort due to pain  and deep palpation revealed a prominent pulsating mass in the central abdomen.  Diagnostic Assessment: The patient's blood tests and ECG findings were within normal limits. However  ultrasonography (US) revealed a dilated infrarenal aorta with an anterior-posterior diameter of 7.2cm and apparent signs of aortic wall weakness. A further CT scan was performed to confirm the diagnosis  which showed a large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with no sign of rupture.  Therapeutic Intervention: The AAA measured in this patient was a significant risk for rupture and required immediate attention. Due to the patient's stable condition  elective open surgical repair was undertaken instead of endovascular repair. An abdominal approach was made  and the AAA was successfully replaced with a synthetic graft. No complications were registered during the procedure. The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit for observation.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: The patient's recovery was uneventful. He was discharged 12 days post-operation with instructions for regular check-ups. Follow-up CT scans at 3 and 6 months post-operatively showed no graft-related complications or recurrence of AAA. The patient remains asymptomatic and is currently under regular outpatient vascular surveillance.  Patient Perspective: The patient reported fear and anxiety upon hearing his diagnosis. After a thorough explanation of the condition  its implications  and the proposed surgical treatment  the patient gave his informed consent. He started abdominal exercises as part of his physical rehabilitation program and was grateful for the high-quality care he received.   Informed Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the treatment procedures and publication of the case details.   Teaching Points: Early recognition and surgical treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms can dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality. It is essential for clinicians to note that severe abdominal or lower back pain in a patient with a significant smoking history might be indicative of AAA. Observation of the patient’s condition post-operation is critical to monitor the recovery route and catch any potential complications early.
10,7,63,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial63,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Geriatric Patient with Significant Cardiovascular History  Introduction: Mr. Johnson  a 79-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe and sudden onset mid-abdominal and lower back pain. On inspection  a pulsatile abdominal mass could be palpated. Given the patient's history of cardiovascular disease  tobacco use  and hypertension  an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was suspected.  Demographics: Patient Information: Mr. Johnson is a retired engineer living with his wife in suburban NY. He smoked for 40 years; however  he quit 10 years ago. His body mass index (BMI) is 27  indicating overweight.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has been treated for a range of chronic illnesses over the past two decades  including ischemic heart disease  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His medications include metformin for diabetes  aspirin and lisinopril for heart disease  and tiotropium bromide for COPD. Mr. Johnson underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery almost 12 years ago and maintains check-ups with his cardiologist annually.  Current Presentation: His sudden onset of severe mid-abdominal pain was not associated with food intake  positioned differently  or radiated elsewhere. No symptoms of diarrhea  vomiting  or changes in bowel habits were reported  although he admitted to having lower back pain. Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass and moderate tenderness in the mid-abdominal region. Due to the suspicion of abdominal aortic aneurysm  an urgent abdominal ultrasound was conducted.  Investigations and Diagnosis: The ultrasound confirmed an infrarenal AAA with a diameter of 5.6 cm. His blood pressure was slightly elevated at 145/92 mmHg. Complete blood count  liver function  and kidney function tests were within normal limits  but blood glucose level was slightly increased.  Management and Follow-Up: Given the size of the aneurysm  the patient was admitted for immediate surgical repair. The patient underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and was placed on intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis. Post-operative recovery was uneventful  with noticeable relief of pain. The patient was discharged on day 5 post-operation. Scheduled follow-ups were arranged to monitor recovery and aneurysm exclusion from the bloodstream.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering AAA in older patients with significant cardiovascular history presenting with acute abdominal or back pain. Early diagnosis and treatment are paramount in preventing catastrophic AAA rupture. It also underscores the need for frequent monitoring in patients with recognized risk factors for AAA  such as smoking history  hypertension  and coronary artery disease—characteristics that were present in this case.

10,7,64,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial64,Patient Information: A 70-year-old African American male  with a past medical history of hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia.  Case Report: The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of an acute onset of severe abdominal and back pain that has persisted for three hours. He is a known hypertensive on medication and a diagnosed diabetic for ten years on oral hypoglycemic agents. He has a twenty-year history of smoking one pack per day. He has been experiencing milder aches in his abdominal and lower back region intermittently over the past few weeks.  On physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable in the periumbilical area. His blood pressure was recorded as 165/100 mmHg and his heart rate was 106 beats/minute. Immediate laboratory investigations including complete blood count  recorded high white blood count suggesting an ongoing systemic inflammation.   An urgent CT scan of the abdomen was done which confirmed the diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  measuring about 7.6 cm in diameter  indicating progression from a possible pre-existing aneurysm considering his past intermittent abdominal discomfort. However  the scan didn't show any evidence of rupture  though the significant size of the aneurysm made it a great concern.  In consultation with vascular surgery  a decision was made to immediately operate for surgical repair given the symptomatic nature and large size of the aneurysm. He underwent a successful open aortic aneurysm repair. Biopsy of the removed aneurysmal wall revealed atherosclerotic changes  consistent with his risk profile of uncontrolled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a long history of smoking.  Post-operative period was uneventful with successful pain management and progressive ambulation. The patient was counseled regarding strict blood pressure control  glycemic control  smoking cessation  and dyslipidemia management to prevent the formation of new aneurysms. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on post-operative day 7  with plans for close follow-up in vascular surgery clinics.  Discussion: This case underlines the importance of maintaining vigilant monitoring and control over cardiovascular risk factors as well as conducting regular screenings for AAA in high-risk individuals. The patient’s longstanding hypertension  diabetes  dyslipidemia  smoking history  and age over 65 years  placed him in a demographic group considered at-risk for AAA. Timely detection and intervention undoubtedly saved this patient from having a catastrophic outcome. Regular screenings and lifestyle modifications should be emphasized to at-risk individuals to prevent the formation of AAA.
10,7,65,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial65,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-Year Old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Patient Information:  Mr. J  a 68-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden-onset severe abdominal and lower back pain persisting over 3 hours. The patient has been residing in Phoenix  Arizona  working as a retired school teacher  and lives with his wife. He doesn't have any children. The patient has a history of smoking a pack a day for the past 40 years and reported occasional consumption of alcohol. He is not on any routine medications apart from low dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Previously  he had no known allergies to food or drugs.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient appeared diaphoretic and was grimacing in pain. His blood pressure was 95/60mmHg  heart rate was 120 beats/minute  respiratory rate was 22 breaths/minute  temperature was 98.4°F  and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.  Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass. The patient was also noted to have a slight motor weakness in both lower extremities with normal sensation and absent peripheral pulses. There was no history of trauma or injury.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Laboratory tests revealed a moderate leukocytosis and mild renal insufficiency (creatinine = 1.5mg/dl). Liver function tests were within normal limits. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 6cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with signs of rupture and a small amount of retroperitoneal hematoma.  Therapeutic Intervention:  He underwent immediate open repair of the ruptured AAA with prosthetic graft placement. He required multiple units of blood during operation due to continuous blood loss.   Follow-up and Outcome:  Post-operative course was complicated by prolonged intubation due to underlying moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and he required mechanical ventilation for three days. His renal function deteriorated further  probably due to perioperative hypotension  but it improved with conservative management and hydration. The patient resumed a regular diet on the 6th postoperative day and was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the surgical ward.  The patient was discharged home after 14 days of hospital stay  with advice to stop smoking  regulate his diet  avoid heavy physical work and be on regular follow-up with his primary care physician and vascular surgeon. He was also prescribed regular low-dose aspirin  a statin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to prevent any possible future complications.  In conclusion  high index of suspicion  early diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention are essential in the management of a ruptured AAA. Primary prevention  through risk factor modification plays a significant role in the management of AAA. Also  early referral to a vascular surgeon for elective repair  when indicated  can significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.
10,7,66,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial66,Case Report  Patient Identification: Mr. Richard Johnston  a 60-year-old African-American male.  Presenting Complaints: The patient came in complaining of persistent  throbbing abdominal pain for the last month  that has gradually increased in intensity. It was also noticed that he felt an unusual pulsating mass in his abdomen while lying down.  Past Medical History: The patient is a known hypertensive and has been on antihypertensive medication for the last 8 years. His blood pressure has been reasonably controlled. He was a heavy smoker but quit 10 years ago. He has no history of diabetes or any high cholesterol level.  Socio-Economic Data: He is a retired engineer and lives with his wife and two daughters. His father died due to heart disease at the age of 62  while his mother is alive and in sound health.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable in the region of his belly button. The patient's blood pressure was slightly elevated but regulated with medication.  Investigations & Diagnosis: An abdominal ultrasound was advised  and it showed an abdominal aortic aneurysm of around 5.6 cm in diameter. Subsequently  a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed  which also confirmed the diagnosis of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm without any sign of rupture.  Treatment: Since the aneurysm was large  the patient was advised for surgery. Endovascular repair was performed  and the patient tolerated the procedure well.   Follow-Up: The patient was followed-up two weeks postsurgery in which a repeat CTA showed successful placement of the endograft without any complication. He was counseled on maintaining a heart-healthy  low sodium diet  regular exercise  and medication adherence to control his hypertension. Regular six-monthly follow-ups were scheduled to monitor the endograft and to detect any late complications. He is expected to have regular check-ups to monitor his blood pressure.  Conclusion: Abdominal aortic aneurysm  especially above 5.5 cm  has a high risk of rupture. Timely detection and endovascular repair in this patient helped prevent potential life-threatening complications. The management of comorbid conditions  including hypertension  is vital in these patients. This case underscores the importance of regular medical follow-ups  especially in patients with a history of smoking and hypertension  to detect aortic aneurysms early and prevent serious consequences.

Diagnosis and Management:  Due to the severe pain  hypotension  and findings on physical examination  a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was suspected. An urgent CT angiography confirmed a large infrarenal AAA measuring 8 cm with evidence of leak. The patient was resuscitated with intravenous fluids and immediately referred for emergency surgical intervention. His condition postoperatively was stable.  Conclusion:  While Mr. A was fortunate to receive immediate medical intervention  this case underscores the importance of awareness of AAA  especially in older males with a history of smoking and hypertension. Mr. A had typical clinical symptoms of ruptured AAA  which has a high mortality rate if not treated promptly. This case reinforces the necessity of regular AAA screening in high-risk groups to prevent fatal outcomes.    Keywords: Abdominal aortic aneurysm  rupture  case report  emergency surgery  screening.
10,7,75,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial75,Title: Evolving Management of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male: Case Report  Patient Presentation: A 78-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of acute onset abdominal pain that had been persisting for 24 hours. The pain was described as severe and constant  originating in the central abdomen and radiating to the back. He also reported a sensation of abdominal fullness. No other significant symptoms were reported  including change in bowel habits  vomiting  or urogenital symptoms.  Demographics: The patient is a retired miner  living with his wife in a suburban area  and is an active smoker consuming around 15-20 cigarettes/day for the past 50 years. He is also a chronic alcoholic  consuming around 200-250gm of alcohol per week. He has no known drug allergies.  Past Medical History: His medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia under control with medication (Lisinopril and Atrovastatin respectively). His surgical history includes right knee arthroplasty approximately 10 years prior. He had been compliant with his medications with regular follow-up appointments with his primary care physician. There were no known cases of similar illness in his family.  Clinical Finding: On physical examination  the patient appeared in distress but vitally stable. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass slightly above the umbilicus that was tender to palpation. Bowel sounds were noted to be sluggish but present in all quadrants.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Blood labs were relatively within normal limits with a mild elevation in white blood cells. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a large  infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring approximately 8cm in diameter with early signs of rupture.     Based on the clinical presentation and imaging  a diagnosis of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was made.  Management: The patient was immediately referred to the vascular surgical team and was taken to the operating room for an emergent open repair of the ruptured AAA. The surgery was successful with no intraoperative complications. He was transferred to the ICU postoperatively for close monitoring and management.  Conclusion: The patient's postoperative course was complicated by acute kidney injury possibly secondary to intraoperative hypotension. However  after supportive management in the intesive care unit  his renal parameters improved and he was able to be discharged in a week. This case emphasizes the potential presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm and the importance of early detection and successful surgical intervention.

Age: 65  Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Current residence: Moscow  Russia Occupational History: Retired computer engineer  Clinical Presentation  The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset  severe  tearing abdominal and back pain. He complained of abdominal fullness and shortness of breath. His vitals on presentation were a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.   Medical History  The patient has a known history of hypertension for over 10 years. He is also a 20-pack-year smoker. There is no history of diabetes mellitus  chest pain  peripheral vascular disease  or any other significant family history related to cardiovascular diseases. His only surgical history includes a hernia repair in 2002.  Examination and Investigations  Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass. Lab reports showed a slight increase in white blood cells and a normal renal function. A Computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis was performed  which confirmed the presence of a 7.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with signs of impending rupture.   Hospital Course and Outcome  Emergency vascular surgery was recommended  considering the size of the aneurysm and the presentation symptoms. The patient underwent successful open AAA repair. The surgery was uneventful with no complications. The post-operative period was also smooth  with the patient showing improvement in symptoms. He was commenced on antiplatelets (as per standard postoperative management for vascular surgery)  beta-blockers (for hypertension management)  and counselled for smoking cessation. He was discharged after a week and was doing well at a month review in the outpatient department.   Discussion  This patient's presentation was typical for a rapidly expanding or ruptured AAA  considering his complaint of sudden  severe pain and the finding of a large  pulsatile abdominal mass on physical examination. His hypertension and history of smoking are significant risk factors. It was fortunate that despite the emergency nature and the size of the aneurysm  the surgical outcome was favorable. This case emphasizes the importance of prompt diagnosis and management of AAA  particularly among high-risk individuals.   The patient was informed about the necessity of further regular medical supervision. A recommendation was also made to examine his first-degree relatives  considering the genetic predisposition to aneurysmal disease. 
10,7,77,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial77,Case Report: A 78-Year-Old Male Presenting with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Information  A 78-year-old Caucasian male  a retired schoolteacher  presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe and sudden onset abdominal and lower back pain. The patient lives in an urban habitat in New Jersey  is a former smoker  and quit around five years back after 40 years of smoking 1 pack/day. His alcohol use is occasional  and he follows a regular diet. He is widowed  lives alone  and is fairly active  performing his daily routine chores without difficulty. He is a known case of hypertension and atherosclerosis with a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) approximately 3 years back.  Clinical Findings  On presentation  the patient was hypertensive with a blood pressure reading of 170/90 mmHg. His HR was 112 bpm  and respiratory rate is 20 breaths/min. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass around the umbilical region consistent with an AAA diagnosis  along with marked tenderness on palpation. His body mass index was calculated to be within the normal range.  Diagnosis  The patient's severe pain profile  hypertension  and initial examination findings alerted the team towards a probable AAA diagnosis. Subsequent to a detailed history intake and preliminary physical examination  an emergency abdominal USG was arranged  which demonstrated a large infrarenal AAA measuring 7cm in diameter. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) was planned to identify further vascular complications but was deferred owing to patients' renal insufficiency.  Therapeutic Intervention  An emergency endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) surgery was suggested considering the size of the aneurysm  age  and comorbidities of the patient. After a detailed discussion about the benefits  risks  and potential complications of the procedure  informed consent was taken from the patient and his family. The EVAR procedure was completed successfully without any intraoperative complications.  Follow-up and Outcome  The patient's postoperative period was uneventful  and pain was gradually subsided over the next few days. He was discharged on day 5 after appropriate wound care education and advice about lifestyle modifications.   He was followed up in the outpatient clinic after 2 weeks  wherein he denied any discomfort  and surgical wound healing appeared satisfactory. His BP was regulated around 140/80 mm Hg with amlodipine. Serial abdominal USGs during follow-ups at 1 month  3 months  6 months  and a year following the surgery reflected no endoleak or aneurysmal growth.  A multidisciplinary team including a cardiologist  a nephrologist  and a physiotherapist actively participated in providing the patient a coordinated care plan. Along with an optimized pharmacotherapy regimen  lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation  maintaining a healthy diet  regular exercise  and avoidance of heavy lifting were reinforced during each follow-up visit.  This case illustrates the fact that rapid and appropriate diagnosis followed by suitable surgical intervention and postoperative care can effectively manage patients having abdominal aortic aneurysm  even in those with significant comorbidities. Furthermore  it highlights the importance of regular follow-up care and continued reinforcement of healthy behaviors in older adults.

Patient Information:  The patient is a 75-year-old Caucasian male  originating from France  and cigarette smoker with a pack per day for 30 years (but ceased smoking at the age of 65). He has been retired for ten years after a long career as a carpenter. His BMI is 28 and lives with his wife in a quiet countryside.  Chief Complaint:  The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of acute onset of severe  constant  and sharp back pain localized in the lower area  with intensity gradually increasing within 2 hours.  Past Medical History:  He has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years  maintained on lisinopril and metformin  respectively. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and takes atorvastatin regularly. The patient has undergone surgery for an inguinal hernia repair about ten years ago. There is no family history of cardiovascular disease. The patient lives a sedentary lifestyle and consumes alcohol moderately.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  the patient had an irregular pulse of 100 beats per minute  blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute  and a temperature of 37.2°C. The patient appeared to be pale and sweating. Examination of the abdomen revealed a pulsatile mass in the midline of the abdomen  and the pain was reproducible on palpation.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Given the patient's advanced age  history of hypertension  and the pulsatile abdominal mass  an AAA was suspected. Urgent abdominal ultrasound confirmed an AAA with a maximum diameter of 8.0 cm  suggesting a potential ruptured AAA. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was immediately performed  which confirmed a ruptured infrarenal AAA with a moderate amount of retroperitoneal hematoma.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient underwent an urgent endovascular aortic repair (EVAR)  which was successful with no intraoperative complications. Post-operative recovery was uneventful  and the patient had regular follow-ups in the vascular clinic.  Follow-up and Outcome:  One month after surgery  the patient's pain had completely resolved. A follow-up ultrasound showed no endoleak  and the aneurysm sac had decreased in size. The patient was advised to have regular check-ups every 6 months to monitor the aneurysm and ensure there is no leak.  Conclusion:  The timely diagnosis and intervention in a ruptured AAA can save lives  especially in high-risk patients with multiple comorbidities.

She worked as a school teacher for 30 years before retirement. The patient lives alone and reports occasional alcohol consumption  limited to social occasions. Her familial history reveals her father died from aortic aneurysm at the age of 78.   Presenting Problem:  The patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with severe  sudden onset of abdominal pain that radiated to her back. She reported the pain to be a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10  with 10 being the most severe. She had no associated fever  shortness of breath  nausea  or vomiting.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass accompanied by tenderness  hypotension  and signs of early hypovolemic shock. The patient’s temperature was normal  but her heart rate was elevated at 110 beats per minute. Her blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg  which was significantly lower than her baseline readings from previous clinical visits.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An urgent abdominal ultrasonography identified an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 8cm in diameter  indicative of a ruptured AAA. The patient's complete blood count revealed moderate anemia and kidney function tests showed elevated creatinine levels suggesting impaired renal function  likely due to decreased perfusion secondary to hypotension.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Given the patient's hemodynamic instability and the size of the aneurysm  emergency open surgical repair was performed. The patient received intravenous fluids  anemia was corrected with blood transfusion and she was taken directly to the operating room under the care of a vascular surgeon. The aneurysmal wall was replaced with a prosthetic graft.  Outcome:  Postoperatively  the patient was monitored within the intensive care unit. After an eventful post-operative period  marked by transient decline in renal function and pulmonary edema  the patient’s conditions stabilized. The renal impairment resolved  and her anemia gradually improved. She was discharged after 15 days of hospital stay and was scheduled to attend follow-up visits and rehabilitation.  Patient Follow-up:  At a 6-month follow-up visit  the patient was stable  with an improved functional status. Her hypertension and hyperlipidemia were well-controlled and follow-up imaging showed satisfactory positioning of the graft with no evidence of leak or new aneurysm formation.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of immediate recognition of a potential ruptured AAA considering the high mortality associated with delayed management. It also emphasizes the need for public awareness about the risks of smoking and hypertension on developing AAA  especially in individuals with positive familial history.

Presenting Concerns:  Mr. F presented to the outpatient vascular clinic for a regular follow-up visit for his AAA. He reported the recent onset of nonspecific  intermittent back pain over the past month. Pain was not associated with eating or exercise  and he reported no changes in bowel or bladder habits.   Clinical findings and Diagnostic Assessment:  On examination  Mr. F appeared comfortable with normal vitals. His abdomen was soft  non-tender  and a pulsatile mass was palpable in the peri-umbilical region  which was unchanged from previous examinations. Blood work  including renal function and glucose  displayed no significant abnormalities  with HbA1c controlled at 7.4%.  A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT was performed promptly  revealing an enlargement of his AAA from an earlier diameter of 4.5 cm to a diameter of 5.7 cm. No evidence was detected of rupture or leak.   Therapeutic Intervention:  Given the AAA’s growth rate and the patient’s symptoms  despite the potential risks associated with his age  comorbidities  and the procedure itself  the interdisciplinary team decided to proceed with an elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The procedure was carried out successfully  without any intraoperative complications. A Stent graft was introduced and placed accurately via the femoral arteries  excluding the aneurysm from the circulation.  Follow-up and Outcome:  Mr. F was discharged home after a few days of monitoring  under strict orders to avoid strenuous activity or lifting heavy weights. Follow-up duplex ultrasonography confirmed a successful procedure with no endoleak and graft patency. His back pain improved  and he reported overall improved wellbeing at the 1 and 6-month postoperative visits.   Patient Perspective:  Mr. F expressed appreciation for the thorough follow-up and swift intervention that """"saved his life"""". He commits to regular follow-up and maintaining a healthier lifestyle  including diet and exercise modifications.   This case emphasizes the importance of regular surveillance of patients with known AAA and making surgical decisions based on individual patient symptoms and aneurysm profiles. Even for elderly patients with multiple comorbidities  well-planned  prompt surgical intervention can yield successful outcomes.  Learning points/Discussion:  Patients known with AAA require regular follow-up; a sudden increase in size or onset of symptoms necessitates consideration for surgical intervention. An individualized approach to considering surgery for AAA patients must take into account the patient's entire health profile and symptomatology."

He is a heavy smoker with a history of 40-pack years. He also has a long-standing history of uncontrolled hypertension.  Chief Complaint: Mr. J presented to the emergency department complaining of severe abdominal and lower back pain for the past six hours. The pain was described as constant  sharp  unbearable  and not relieved with over-the-counter analgesics.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He has had no previous surgical interventions. There is no known family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  Mr. J was noted to be in severe distress due to pain. A pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable during the physical examination. The blood pressure was 174/92 mmHg  heart rate was 108 bpm and the temperature was 37.4°C. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment: The initial laboratory evaluation was unexceptional. Abdominal ultra-sonography followed by confirmatory CT angiography revealed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 8cm in diameter  indicating imminent risk of rupture.  Therapeutic Intervention: The findings were emergently discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained for interventional surgery. An open surgical repair was carried via an infrarenal aortic graft replacement due to the location and size of the aneurysm. In the course of post-operative care  antihypertensive and analgesic medication were administered.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient's post-operative recovery was unremarkable. He was discharged after six days in the hospital. At his six-week follow-up  the patient reported no abdominal or back pain and his blood pressure was adequately controlled.   In Summary:  This case demonstrates the classic presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with severe abdominal and back pain with a pulsatile abdominal mass in an elderly male patient with a history of heavy smoking and uncontrolled hypertension. The patient was successfully managed with open surgical repair.   Lessons Learned:  Patients with risk factors such as older age  smoking  hypertension  and male sex should be evaluated for abdominal aortic aneurysms  particularly in the setting of abdominal or back pain. Early detection and management of abdominal aortic aneurysms can prevent catastrophic consequences of rupture.   Prevention methods  such as controlling blood pressure  quitting smoking  and managing blood cholesterol and glucose level  are essential in patients diagnosed with or at risk of AAA. Regular follow-ups and imaging studies are important for monitoring the aneurysm size.
10,7,84,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial84,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 65-year-old Male Patient: A Case Report  Introduction: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by an abnormal enlargement of the abdominal aorta. This report describes a case of a ruptured AAA in a senior patient with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Case presentation:  The patient  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  a retired construction worker  presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe  tearing abdominal pain radiating to his back. He had a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and tobacco smoking for the past 30 years (up to 20 cigarettes per day). He had no genetic disposition nor previous surgery history. He does not consume alcohol and had no known allergies.   Clinically  he was in obvious distress and diaphoretic. His vitals included a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg  a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. On physical examination  a pulsatile mass was palpable in the mid-abdominal area.  The patient was immediately managed with intravenous fluids  and analgesics and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) abdomen was arranged  which confirmed the presence of a large  approximately 9.1 cm  ruptured AAA with evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.   Due to the rapid deterioration in the patient's hemodynamic state  surgical consultation was obtained promptly  and an emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was performed  which was successful.   Postoperatively  the patient was observed in the intensive care unit (ICU)  where he received blood transfusion  platelet transfusion  antihypertensive  analgesic and anticoagulant therapy. His recovery was uneventful  with gradual improvement in his blood pressure and decrease in his pain intensity. After two weeks of hospitalization and continued improvement  he was discharged with close outpatient follow-up arrangements.  Discussion and Conclusion:  This case illustrates the significant implications of prompt recognition and management of an AAA  particularly in patients with risk factors such as old age  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a history of smoking. Though a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain is not exclusive to AAA  the presence of risk factors and a palpable abdominal mass should raise suspicion  prompting necessary diagnostic investigations. Emergency surgery  in this case  endovascular repair  can be lifesaving in preserving the patient's life.
10,7,85,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial85,Patient Profile: Mr. Norman Foster  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  Chief Complaint: Mr. Foster made a visit to the emergency room complaining of persistent lower back and abdominal pain. The onset of pain was sudden and increased in severity over a short period of time.  Past Medical History: Mr. Foster has a known history of hypertension  for which he has been taking beta-blockers  as prescribed. However  his blood pressure has been mostly uncontrolled. He also reports a 40-pack year history of smoking but quit five years before the current visit. There is no history of diabetes mellitus  high cholesterol  or any significant family history of cardiovascular disease. Regular follow-ups have shown a slightly raised creatinine level indicative of renal dysfunction. No previous surgeries or hospital admissions were reported apart from routine health check-ups.  Social History: A retired accountant  Mr. F lives with his wife and son. He denied any alcohol abuse or use of psychoactive substances beyond smoking until five years ago.  Examination: On examination  he appeared to be slightly pale and in distress due to pain. His vitals were stable  however  with a blood pressure of 140/90. The abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile  expansile mass in the midline of the abdomen.  Investigations: Results from contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen confirmed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 6.5cm in its maximum diameter. An initial blood panel showed borderline anemia without any indications of infection or renal dysfunction.  Treatment: Mr. Foster was immediately admitted to the vascular surgery service for preoperative care. The patient and his family were diligently informed about the surgery and possible risks. The following day  Mr. Foster underwent successful endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).  Postoperative Care: The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was sent home five days later. He is advised to have regular follow-ups with the vascular surgery and internal medicine team for constant monitoring of general wellbeing and the efficiency of the graft.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of regular follow-ups for patients with hypertension and a history of smoking in the timely diagnosis and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm. It also brings to focus the effectiveness of endovascular surgery in managing large infrarenal AAAs.
10,7,86,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial86,Title: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a High-Risk Elderly Male  Patient Information The patient is a 78-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired construction worker  lives with his 70-year-old wife  and has two adult children living nearby. The patient is an ex-smoker and has a history of moderate alcohol use.  Past Medical History The patient has a confirmed medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he has been under regular treatment for the past 15 years. He has also shown mild signs of early-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and age-related arthritis in the past few years.  Complaint and Current Presentation The patient presented himself in the Emergency Department with sudden-onset  severe pain in the lower abdominal and lumbar area that radiated to his scrotum and thighs. He described the pain as constant and tearing. He also reported feelings of faintness and rapid heartbeats.  Diagnostic Assessment Physical examination showed the patient had a tender  pulsatile mass in the abdomen and was hypotensive. Laboratory tests confirmed a decreased level of hemoglobin  suggesting possible internal bleeding. An urgent abdominal ultrasound revealed a 9 cm aneurysm in the infra-renal part of the aorta with signs of rupture. A CT angiogram further confirmed these findings of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Therapeutic Intervention The patient was rushed in for an emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) due to his high risk for an open surgical repair. A stent-graft was placed at the site of the aneurysm to prevent further rupture  under general anesthesia. The procedure went smoothly without any immediate complications.  Follow-Up and Outcome  After the surgery  the patient was closely monitored in the ICU for his vitals  and adequate analgesics were given to manage the postoperative pain. He made a slow but steady recovery and was discharged after 10 days. He was advised for regular follow-up every six months with ultrasound imaging to monitor the stent graft.  Teaching Points Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate surgical intervention. The management of AAA depends largely on the size of the aneurysm and the general health of the patient (as observed in this case  where the patient was considered a high-risk candidate for open surgery due to his age  COPD  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia). Regular follow-up postoperation is critical for such patients to monitor the patency of the stent-graft and possible endoleaks.
10,7,87,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial87,Title: A Case Report of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 70-Year-Old Male   Patient Information: Our patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack year smoking history. He is a retired mechanic who lives with his wife and denies drug use or alcohol consumption. He has no family history of aneurysms or sudden cardiac death.  Clinical Findings: The patient was referred to the vascular clinic for evaluation of a pulsatile abdominal mass discovered during a routine physical examination. The patient denied any abdominal pain  changes in bowel habits  or loss of weight. On physical examination  the patient had a noticeable pulsatile mass approximately 4cm in diameter in the periumbilical region. There were no signs of peripheral vascular disease.  Timeline of Current Episode: The patient was not aware of his abdominal mass until it was discovered during his routine physical exam three weeks ago. He reported no symptoms priorly or since the time of discovery.  Diagnostic Assessment: The initial diagnosis was made clinically  based on the physical examination. An ultrasound of the abdomen was performed  and it confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a maximum diameter of 5.3 cm. A Computerized tomography angiography (CTA) of the abdomen and pelvis was subsequently performed to provide a detailed blueprint of the aneurysm and surrounding anatomy.   Therapeutic Intervention: Given that the aneurysm was >5 cm  surgical repair was planned. After shared decision-making with the patient  it was decided to undergo an Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR) procedure. The procedure was conducted without any immediate complications and he was kept under observation for a few days.  Outcome and Follow-up: The patient had a swift recovery and was discharged a few days later. He was followed up at 1  3  6  and 12 months post-surgery and surveillance imaging showed no endoleaks  thus confirming a successful procedure.

He is a smoker with a 30 pack-year history. His medical history underscores hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.  Medical History:  The patient is known to have had hypertension for the last 15 years which has been controlled with antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril). Six years ago  he was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia and has since been on statin (atorvastatin) therapy to manage cholesterol levels.  Family History:  Mr. X has a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father passed away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 57. His older brother underwent a surgical intervention for an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 57.  Current Presentation and Examination:  The patient reported an intense and constant pain in his abdominal region that seemed to radiate to his lower back. The pain was described as sharp in nature. He also reported feeling lightheaded. His initial BP was 160/90 mmHg with a pulse rate of 100 beats per minute.  Clinical examination revealed an irregularly pulsatile abdominal mass  slightly tender to touch. His systemic review was comparatively unremarkable  with the exception of reported mild dyspnea.  Investigations:  An urgent ultrasound examination of his abdomen was carried out indicating a fusiform abdominal aorta measuring 7.0 cm in diameter confirming an abdominal aortic aneurysm.   A computer tomography angiogram (CTA) was subsequently performed  which further confirmed the ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm diagnosis. Blood tests indicated mild anemia  possibly due to chronic blood loss  and normal kidney function tests.  Treatment and Outcome:  Due to the clinical presentation  patient's medical and familial history  an emergent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was recommended. The patient was promptly limited to nil per os (NPO) and IV hydration was started. The patient underwent successful EVAR without any complications. His postoperative recovery was relatively uneventful.  Currently  Mr. X is monitored closely  with regular ultrasound surveillance recommended every 6 months. He was advised to quit smoking and was referred to a smoking cessation clinic. His blood pressure and cholesterol-lowering medications were also optimized for better control.  Summary:  This case report illustrates the significance of recognizing the symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  especially in high-risk patients who have significant smoking history  hypertension  and a family history of aortic diseases.

10,7,96,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial96,"Title: An Atypical Presentation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Introduction: A 68-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department with sudden and severe back pain  centered towards his lower back region. The initial differential diagnosis was based around musculoskeletal pain as he has a past medical history of arthritis and degenerative disc disease. Subsequently  his abdominal examination revealed an unanticipated finding that steered toward the diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Patient Information: Mr. M  a retired construction foreman  was brought to the emergency department by his wife. He is 5'10"""" in height and weighs around 210 lbs. He is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history before stopping 5 years ago. He has hypertension  controlled with antihypertensive medication (amlodipine)  arthritis  degenerative disc disease  and a history of coronary artery disease without any prior cardiac surgery requirement.  Clinical Findings:  The patient described his pain as """"a tearing sensation"""" that began suddenly whilst bending to lift a heavy object. He denied having any abdominal pain  chest pain  nausea  vomiting or any loss of consciousness. On physical examination  the patient appeared to be in distress  with a blood pressure of 170/90 mmHg  a pulse rate of 90 beats per minute  and respirations at 22 per minute. His abdomen was soft but showed a pulsatile mass in the peri-umbilical region.   Diagnostic Assessment: The patient’s hematological and biochemical parameters were within the normal range. Given the unexpected abdominal examination findings  an urgent CT scan was completed  which revealed a 7.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was emergently consulted to the vascular surgical team and was subsequently taken to the operating room for an open surgical repair of his AAA. An aorto-bi-iliac graft was successfully placed.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient’s postoperative period was uneventful. Pain subsided and he was transferred to a regular ward on day 3 of recovery. He was discharged home on day 7 after tolerating normal diet and independent ambulation. At his one month follow-up appointment  the patient was free of any abdominal or back pain  and a duplex ultrasound demonstrated the graft to be patent.   Patient Perspective: Mr. M reported that he had no knowledge of AAA prior to his surgical intervention. He was grateful for the timely diagnosis and management  attributing his recovery to the early detection of the disease  even though the presentation was misleading.  Conclusion: Although this case initially pointed toward musculoskeletal pain  the inclusion of an AAA in the differential diagnosis demonstrates the importance of a comprehensive medical examination. It underlines the significance of considering an AAA among the elderly population  even in the absence of the classic symptomatic triad: abdominal pain  hypotension  and a pulsatile mass."

No known family history of any connective tissue diseases or aneurysms.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination demonstrated a pulsatile abdominal mass upon palpation. No bruits could be heard over the mass. Legs were symmetrically normal with no noticeable difference in pulses. No signs of acute limb ischemia or embolic phenomena were present.   Diagnostic Assessment: An abdominal ultrasound was obtained which showed a dilated aorta measuring approximately 6.5 cm in diameter. Immediate computed tomographic angiography was done and confirmed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm  with a maximum diameter of 6.8 cm without signs of rupture.  Therapeutic Intervention: Given the size of the AAA and the risk of rupture  the patient was referred urgently to vascular surgery. An endovascular stent graft was placed to seal the aneurysm site  and the procedure was completed without complications. The patient was monitored in the ICU for several days before being transferred to the medical ward.   Follow up: The patient was given follow-up appointments for clinical check-ups and radiological evaluation of the stent placement and aneurysm. Alongside  he was advised to continue lifestyle modifications  maintain control of blood pressure  ensure statin intake and avoid heavy lifting or straining. He was advised to notice and report the signs of possible complications such as shortness of breath  chest  abdominal  or back pain.   Conclusion: AAA is a severe  and life-threatening condition often presented with a pulsatile abdominal mass  and prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention can prevent fatal outcomes. High-risk individuals like elderly male  smokers  hypertensive  and hyperlipidemic should receive regular screenings to detect an AAA early in its course.
10,7,98,diagnosis10-prompt7-trial98,Title: Emergency Management of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in an Elderly Male Patient – A case report.  Introduction:  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) refers to the enlargement of the abdominal aorta  often posing a significant risk of rupture  leading to life-threatening hemorrhage. It is most commonly seen in elderly men with a history of smoking or hypertension. This case report presents an elderly male patient presenting to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain and diagnosed with an AAA.  Patient Information:  Mr. X  a 75-year-old Caucasian male  was brought to the ED with complaints of acute onset  severe abdominal and lower back pain. The patient is a former smoker with a 30 year smoking history but quit approximately ten years ago. He has an established history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral vascular disease. His medications include daily aspirin  atorvastatin  and lisinopril.  Clinical Findings:  Upon presentation  the patient was anxious and pale with a mildly distended abdomen. His vitals were: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg  pulse rate 110 beats/minute  respiratory rate 22/minute  and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. On physical examination  a pulsatile mass was felt in the mid-abdominal region  suggestive of an aneurysmal enlargement of the abdominal aorta. Laboratory findings showed an elevated white cell count and D-dimer level.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An urgent computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the abdomen revealed a 7.5 cm infrarenal AAA with signs of impending rupture. No immediate signs of active bleeding were evident.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Given the imminent threat of rupture  the patient was hastily prepped for surgery. He underwent an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) which successfully excluded the aneurysm from systemic circulation. The procedure was uneventful  and the patient was stabilized post-operatively.  Follow-up and Outcome:  Post-operatively  the patient was monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU). He was discharged on the 10th postoperative day in stable condition. He has since been followed up in the vascular surgery outpatient's department  with no sign of reperfusion or endoleak evident on follow-up imaging. He is managed on antihypertensives  statins  and regular follow-up to monitor his condition.  Discussion:  In this case  the patient's history of smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia were contributing factors to the AAA. AAAs often remain asymptomatic until rupture  making timely diagnosis and management crucial. A high index of suspicion along with swift diagnosis and intervention can be life-saving.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the need for heightened vigilance in at-risk individuals presenting with abdominal and lower back pain. Earlier diagnosis could prevent rupture of an AAA  reducing mortality and morbidity in this patient population.

10,9,1,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial1,"Patient Presentation   Introduction: Mr. A is a 75-year-old Caucasian male who presented with abdominal and lower back pain that had lasted the entire weekend. His pain level was described as a 6/10  dull in nature and non-radiating. Upon clinical examination  a pulsating mass near the navel was noticed. He also claimed that he had been feeling """"quite tired"""" for several weeks prior to this episode.   Clinical History:  Mr. A is a smoker  consuming approximately one pack of cigarettes per day for the last 50 years. He has a history of hypertension under control with lisinopril  and he was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia ten years ago  being managed by statin therapy. His BMI score of 31 classifies him as obese. He also mentioned that he has been experiencing difficulty with micturition.   Family History:  Mr. A's father had a history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and passed away from a ruptured AAA at the age of 78 years. His mother died of heart disease at the age of 75. He has two elder brothers who are hypertensive and one of them had a myocardial infarction.   Physical Examination: On presentation  he is alert and oriented  not in acute distress. His BP is 150/90 mmHg  HR 85 bpm  and his BMI is 31. Physical examination noted a pulsatile mass in his abdomen.  Investigations: The point-of-care ultrasound showed an aorta of approximately 5 cm in diameter. A confirmatory CT angiogram displayed an infrarenal AAA of 5.2 cm diameter with no signs of rupture.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical history  physical examinations  and investigations  the patient was diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Management:  He was referred to a Vascular Surgeon for further assessment and management. He was also educated on the risks of rupture of the aneurysm and the imperative need to quit smoking to reduce his cardiovascular risk factors.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the importance of early detection and treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  especially in patients with a high-risk profile such as advanced age  long-term smoking  obesity  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and positive family history."
10,9,2,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial2,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 68-year-old male known as Mr. Adam Williams. He is a retired school teacher and resides with his wife in their suburban home. He identifies as Caucasian  hails from Irish descent  and served briefly in the army during his younger years. His chief complaint is a progressively worsening  constant  throbbing pain in his mid-to-lower abdomen and lower back that's been making him very uncomfortable for the past three weeks.  Medical History:  Mr. Williams was diagnosed as hypertensive about 10 years ago  and he has been controlling his blood pressure with regular medication (Lisinopril). Five years ago  he was diagnosed with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  a consequence of his 30-year smoking history. He quit smoking immediately after his COPD diagnosis. He also suffers from hyperlipidemia but has diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus in good control with metformin. He has no known allergies to medications.  Family History:  There is a significant familial predisposition to cardiovascular diseases. Mr Williams' father died of a heart attack at 72  while his mother had a stroke at the age of 76. His only sibling  a brother  has had coronary artery bypass surgery at 65. There is no family history of aneurysms.  Clinical Examination and Diagnosis:  On examination  a pulsating mass was noted in the mid-abdominal area. Upon suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  an abdominal ultrasound was ordered  which confirmed a 5.5 cm AAA (abdominal aortic aneurysm). He also underwent a chest X-ray and echocardiogram due to his severe COPD  which revealed moderate left ventricular hypertrophy  but no other significant anomalies.   Given the size of the aneurysm and taking into consideration the patient's overall health and family history were taken into account  he was referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation. His shortness of breath and palpitation during mild activity have made the cardiothoracic teams suggest that he may need elective surgical repair of the aneurysm.  In conclusion  Mr Williams  a 68-year-old ex-smoker with a history of hypertension  COPD  and hyperlipidemia  presents with an MRI-confirmed abdominal aortic aneurysm of 5.5 cm. The aneurysm's size  coupled with his other risk factors  suggests a high risk of rupture  requiring further surgical evaluation.  For future medical management  he was advised to maintain strict control of his blood pressure and to assess lipid status to prevent complications of his aneurysm and lessen the risk of other cardiovascular diseases. He was also recommended to have follow-up assessments every six months to monitor his condition.
10,9,3,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial3,Case Presentation  Demographics: Patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who is a retired factory worker. He is a non-smoker and has a moderate alcohol history.  Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a complaint of severe  unrelenting pain in the middle of his abdomen and back  which began suddenly while lifting a heavy box.  Medical History: The patient has history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past 10 years  managed under medication. He has been treated in the past for peripheral arterial disease. He has no known allergies and indicates he is up to date with his vaccinations. He does not have any history of surgeries. He admits non-compliance with both diet and medications  with frequent lapses.  Family History: The patient has a strong family history of cardiac disease  with his father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 55  and his mother having high blood pressure. His brother was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at age 64 but declined surgery.  Physical Examination: The patient appears to be in severe pain  pale  and slightly diaphoretic. He's afebrile with a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  a pulse rate of 110/min  and respiratory rate of 20/min. On physical examination  the abdomen is soft  and pulsatile mass is palpable in the mid and upper part of the abdomen. No other significant findings were noted.  Investigations: Lab tests revealed normal renal function  but elevated white blood cell count suggesting possible infection. An urgent CT-Angiogram revealed a 7cm abdominal aortic aneurysm with evidence of rupture.  Diagnosis: Based on history  physical examination  and imaging  the patient was diagnosed with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Treatment and Plan: The patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit and emergent surgical consultation was sought. Due to the patient's age and the risks associated with open surgery  both patient and surgical team decided on endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) as the treatment modality. He was scheduled for emergent intervention. The patient was also counselled regarding the importance of medication compliance and a heart-healthy diet.    
10,9,4,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial4,Patient Profile:   The patient  Mr. Smith  is a 68-year-old Caucasian male who resides in Charleston  South Carolina. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases as both his father and uncle died of heart attacks in their late 60s. He has been a smoker for 40+ years and has a history of high blood pressure  though he has not been consistent with his medication regimen. Professionally  he is a retired engineer who lives with his 65-year-old wife in a suburban neighborhood.  Presenting Complaints:   Mr. Smith presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe and persistent abdominal pain and lower back pain  which had begun that morning. He describes the pain as a constant and sharp sensation.  Clinical Findings:   Upon physical examination  a pulsating mass was palpable in his lower abdomen  and he had a blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg. Basic blood profiles showed elevated white blood cell counts of 13 000 cells/mm^3. His cholesterol and serum creatinine levels were also higher than the normal range.  Imaging:   A triplex ultrasonography was immediately ordered upon suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  which confirmed a 6cm infrarenal AAA. The aneurysm appeared to be leaking  which was likely causing his severe pain.   Diagnosis:   The presence of a large pulsating abdominal mass  characteristic pain  and ultrasonography findings confirmed the diagnosis of a rapidly expanding or possibly leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Treatment Plan:  Given the size of the aneurysm and his pain  he was immediately evaluated for surgical repair. Emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was performed to prevent rupture  the risk of which was increased due to the size and expansion of the aneurysm.  Aftercare:  Post-surgery  Mr. Smith will require a closely monitored recovery period  including regular check-ups to assess the successful integration of the graft and ensure there is no leak. Lifestyle modifications were also affirmed  including a well-rounded diet  regular exercise  smoking cessation  and moderating alcohol intake  to control his blood pressure and cholesterol levels. It is essential to provide him with regular monitoring and medication control for his hypertension management.  He is also advised to communicate the hereditary nature of cardiovascular diseases to his children so that they can proactively monitor their heart health. Given how late Mr. Smith's AAA was detected  his children would benefit from occasional ultrasound screenings for AAA  which can be life-saving for those with a family history of cardiovascular disease.
10,9,5,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial5,Patient Identification and Background: Mr. Edward Green  a 67-year-old Caucasian male who resides in Brooklyn  New York has been diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient is retired and lives with his wife  who is his primary caregiver.   Presenting Issue:  Mr. Green initially presented with complaints of steady middle abdominal pain and occasional lower back pain which he had been experiencing for about two weeks. No incidents of fainting  light-headedness  rapid heart rate or weakness on one side of the body were recorded and the patient does not have a history of palpitations or shortness of breath.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  the patient appeared visibly discomforted with the abdominal pain. His pulse was stable but the physician was able to palpate an expansive aortic pulsation in the abdomen about 6cm in width. There were no symptoms of rupture like extreme pain  hypotension  or loss of consciousness.   Medical History: Mr. Green was previously diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which he has been managing with diet  medication  and regular exercise. He underwent an appendectomy when he was young but other than that  no significant surgical history. He has regularly used alcohol and tobacco for 40 years but quit smoking five years ago.   Family History: Mr. Green’s father died of a ruptured AAA at the age of 70. His mother died from a stroke at the age of 75. There is no other significant family history of heart disease  aneurysms  or genetic disorders.   Diagnostic Evaluation: For further evaluation  a Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan was performed which confirmed the presence of a 5.5 cm infrarenal AAA.   Management Plan: Given the size of the aneurysm and the associated risk of rupture  the vascular surgery team was consulted and an elective open surgical repair of the aneurysm was recommended. Mr. Green was counseled about the risks and benefits of the surgery and the importance of regular follow-ups thereafter.  Discussion: Abdominal aortic aneurysm's risk factors are notably the patient’s advanced age  genetic predisposition  and a history of hypertension  smoking  and hyperlipidemia  as in this case. Early detection and surgical intervention are crucial in preventing potentially life-threatening ruptures.   Conclusion: This case presentation clearly demonstrates classical manifestations of undiagnosed AAA  emphasizing the importance of timely investigation and intervention  especially in high-risk patients with specifics in their medical and family history.
10,9,6,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial6,Patient Presentation: J.D.  a seventy-two-year-old male of African American descent  has presented to the emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain  radiating to his low back and groin. He also reported feeling light-headed with a transient loss of consciousness an hour prior to admission. His vital signs on arrival were blood pressure 90/50 mmHg  heart rate 84 bpm  respiratory rate 16 bpm  and temperature 98.6°F. He is a retired lawyer  widowed  with two adult children  and lives alone. He does not smoke or consume alcohol but struggled with obesity for many years.   Past Medical History: His past medical history includes type II diabetes diagnosed fifteen years ago  which he manages with Metformin and lifestyle modification. He also has been diagnosed with hypertension for eight years for which he takes Lisinopril  but he admits to not always adhering to the medication regimen. Five years ago  he was diagnosed with high cholesterol and coronary artery disease for which he had undergone angioplasty. He currently takes Atorvastatin for cholesterol control.   Family History: His father died from a heart attack at the age of 70  and his mother passed away due to stroke disease in her late 60s. He also reported that his brother underwent surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm several years back.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination showed moderate-severe tenderness in the middle and lower abdomen. His abdomen is not distended  but a pulsatile mass was palpable on deep palpation in the periumbilical region. Blood work indicated a moderately elevated white blood cell count  suggestive of systemic infection. An urgent CT scan showed a large abdominal aortic aneurysm (8cm in diameter) with evidence of impending rupture.  Diagnosis:  The diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm was made based on his clinical history  physical examination and radiography findings.  Plan: Immediate surgical consultation is called for  and the patient is prepared for emergent endovascular aneurysm repair. The patient was also counseled about the seriousness of his condition  the nature of the surgical procedure  and potential risks involved. Antihypertensive treatment will be re-evaluated after surgery to ensure better blood pressure control. It's also recommended for his children to undergo screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm due to the familial link.    Teaching: Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in males  smokers  and have a strong genetic component. A family history of aortic aneurysm significantly increases the risk. High blood pressure adds to the threat by causing wear and tear of the aorta  hence the importance of adhering to antihypertensive treatment. Screening and early detection can save lives.  Prognosis: Prognosis depends on successful surgical intervention  and the ability to manage associated comorbidities including hypertension  dyslipidemia  and diabetes. Early detection before rupture significantly improves outcomes. With successful surgery and good post-operative care  the survival rate can be as high as 95%.

10,9,8,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial8,Patient Information: A 70-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. John  who resides in Downtown  Manhattan. He is a retired engineer and lives with his wife. He is a non-smoker and maintains a moderate level of physical activity. He doesn't report any regular intake of alcohol or illicit substances. Born and raised in a rural setting  moved to the city for work but adopted a balanced lifestyle.   Presenting Problem:  Mr. John presented with intermittent  abdominal discomfort over the past few weeks  which he dismissed initially  attributing it to indigestion. Lately  however  the discomfort intensifies when he walks more than two blocks.   Past Medical History: Mr. John had a noteworthy medical history of mild hypertension diagnosed about 10 years ago  for which he is under medication (Enalapril 10 mg  once daily). No reports of any chronic diseases such as diabetes  COPD  or any pre-existing cardiac conditions. He did have a noted history of high cholesterol diagnosed around 7 years ago  treated with atorvastatin (20mg  once daily).   Family History: His father passed away at the age of 60 due to a stroke. His mother died due to Alzheimer's disease. There's no reported family history of any aneurysms  cardiac conditions  or familial genetic disorders.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  a pulsatile mass was palpable in his abdomen  a bruit was audible upon auscultation. Otherwise  his cardiovascular  respiratory  neurological  and musculoskeletal examinations were unremarkable.   Diagnostic Assessment: Given his presenting symptoms and medical history  an suspicion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was formed. This suspicion was confirmed through an ultrasound which showed an 5.5 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm.   Plan: Given the size of the aneurysm  surgery stands as the likely next step as watchful waiting carries significant risk. Vascular surgery consultation is imperative to discuss the options for open surgical repair vs endovascular aneurysm repair. The patient has been briefed on the need for lifestyle changes and the risk factors to control  like blood pressure and cholesterol levels  ensuring regular health check-ups.  Teaching: Mr. John and his wife are educated about the nature of his condition  symptoms to watch out for like severe abdominal or back pain (known as the herald symptoms of AAA rupture)  and the importance of strict blood pressure control and cholesterol management to prevent further complications. They were also made aware of the surgical procedures and post-surgical care.   This presentation summarises the clinical case of Mr. John and his recently diagnosed condition  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.
10,9,9,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial9,Patient Presentation  Mr. Collins  a 75-year-old Caucasian male  presented with sudden  severe abdominal and lower back pain. He has been a regular patient at our facility for a few years now  diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are well-managed with medications. He follows a reasonably healthy lifestyle  with habits such as moderate alcohol use  non-smoking  and maintaining a balanced diet. He also keeps under regular surveillance for his medical issues. Commendably  he has a relatively active lifestyle for his age  engaging in regular moderate physical activities.  His family history is significant with his late father succumbing to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in his late 70s and mother dying due to heart disease. His elder brother also died due to myocardial infarction  suggesting this family's prevalent cardiovascular issues.  During his arrival at the facility  he manifested persistent but steady vital signs: BP 140/90 mmHG  Pulse- 87 bpm  Respiration Rate- 18 breaths per min  Temperature- 98.6 degrees. Further inspection confirmed tenderness in his central and lower abdominal region and lumbar. The auscultation supported a bruit over the abdominal aorta.  Following this physical examination  an urgent CT scan was ordered. The subsequent imaging report revealed an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 6.3 cm  consistent with the preliminary diagnosis.   The patient's high familial history of cardiovascular disease  age  and hyperlipidemia puts him at significant risk of developing AAA. Given the patient's acute severe abdominal pain and the ultrasound report's findings  the aneurysm's size makes it prone to rupture  which can be a life-threatening state.   An interdisciplinary approach with vascular surgeons  anesthesiologists  and nursing staff is mandatory in this case to plan  prepare  and execute the urgent surgical intervention for AAA repair. The patient  upon stabilization  has been scheduled for an emergency open surgical repair of the aneurysm. He is currently receiving pain management and under close monitoring to control his blood pressure and other vitals until the surgery.  Conclusion:  Mr. Collins is a clear case of AAA risk due to his age  male gender  hereditary factors  and history of hypertension. Urgent surgical intervention could save his life. His case emphasizes the importance of regular screening and early diagnosis in susceptible populations. Post his recovery  it will be essential to emphasize good health practices  focusing primarily on diet  physical activity  and chronic disease control to prevent potential reoccurrence or development of associated complications.

He reported the pain to be constant  with occasional episodes of intensification. He denied experiencing any notable weight loss  appetite changes  nausea  vomiting  or changes in bowel or bladder activity.  Past Medical History:  Mr. X has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past 15 years and is being managed with an ACE inhibitor (Lisinopril). He also has a history of high cholesterol levels which are under control with statins (Atorvastatin). He quit smoking 10 years ago after a 30-year history and currently drinks alcohol socially. He has no known food or drug allergies.  Family History:  Mr. X's father died at the age of 72 due to a 'ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm'. His mother is alive and well at the age of 89. He has a younger brother diagnosed with diabetes.  Examination and Imaging:  Physical examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the abdomen. Lab tests showed normal renal function and liver function  with slightly elevated cholesterol levels. A CT abdominal scan was performed which confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.4 cm in diameter.  Diagnosis:  Mr. X was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm likely linked to a history of hypertension  high cholesterol  and a family history of the same condition.   Plan:  Due to the size of the aneurysm and the potential risk of rupture  surgical intervention is suggested. He was planned for an open surgical repair (OSR) of the aneurysm. He will have to be admitted to the hospital for the necessary preoperative workup and investigations. Post-operative care will be focused on pain management  close monitoring of his vital signs  and early mobilisation to prevent complications. He will be counseled for lifestyle modifications to manage his blood pressure and cholesterol levels as part of the long term management.  Discussion:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a potentially life-threatening condition where early diagnosis is the key to successful management. In this case  the patient's past medical history and family history were indicative of the condition and diagnostic imaging confirmed the diagnosis.  In terms of prognosis  surgical repair generally has a high success rate. Post-operatively Mr. X will need regular follow-ups  and he will need to stick to a strict regimen to control hypertension and cholesterol which are known risk factors for recurrent AAA.   This case emphasizes the need for considering abdominal aortic aneurysm in older males with a history of smoking  hypertension  and the presence of similar conditions in the family. Prompt diagnosis and aggressive management of risk factors can significantly improve outcomes in these patients.

10,9,15,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial15,Patient Presentation:   Patient Identification: Mr. A  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  has presented with a diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Presenting Symptoms: The patient reported a sudden onset of severe pain in his lower back and abdomen that did not subside  along with nausea  rapid heartbeat  and dizziness when standing.   Past Medical History: Mr. A has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he has been taking medications. His long-standing smoking habit (30-pack years) and sedentary lifestyle have likely contributed to his current situation. He has no known allergies. Mr. A was also diagnosed with peripheral artery disease and early-stage COPD 3 years ago.   Family History: Both his parents had cardiovascular-related issues. His father passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 72 and his mother had a stroke at 75 but survived.  Social History: Mr. A is retired and mostly spends his time indoors due to his COPD. He is a widower with two adult children who live out of town. He quit smoking two years ago and consumes alcohol moderately about twice a week.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  a visible and palpable pulsating mass was noted in his abdomen just above the umbilicus  consistent with the size noted on ultrasound (5.6 cm in diameter). The patient's vitals were as follows: blood pressure: 170/85 mmHg  Heart Rate: 95 bpm  Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths/minute.   Diagnostic Assessment: The aneurysm was initially discovered during a routine abdominal ultrasound  after which an abdominal CT scan was conducted for confirmation and better visualization of the aneurysm. The AAA of 5.6 cm in diameter was identified starting just below the renal arteries and ending just before the iliac arteries.  Treatment: Given the size and symptoms of the aneurysm  the possibility of rupture is high  necessitating immediate surgical intervention. He was admitted to the vascular surgery unit for an urgent EVAR (endovascular aneurysm repair) procedure. The patient also received instructions on lifestyle modifications  especially diet control  weight management  and regular exercise post-recovery  to manage his chronic conditions and prevent the recurrence of AAA.  Prognosis: Following successful surgical intervention  strict blood pressure control  and lifestyle modifications  the patient's prognosis could be significantly improved. Regular follow-up is necessary to monitor and manage his AAA and other comorbidities.
10,9,16,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial16,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 65-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the hospital presenting a pulsating abdominal mass  abdominal pain  and constant back pain. His symptoms have been developing over the course of the past few months. He reports a family history significant for cardiovascular disease. His father had a coronary artery disease and died at age 75 from a myocardial infarction  and an older brother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) diagnosed at his 60s.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson quit smoking 10 years ago  but he was a two-pack-a-day smoker for over 40 years. He leads a sedentary lifestyle and has a history of hypertension for which he takes Lisinopril. He has a past medical history of """"borderline"""" diabetes and has mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  but he is not on any medications for either. He also underwent gallbladder surgery two decades ago.   Presenting Issue:  Physical examination revealed a non-tender  pulsatile mass in the middle and upper part of his abdomen. It measured approximately 4 cm in diameter. No bruit was heard over it. His blood pressure reading was 160/90 in his right arm and his pulse was 70 bpm. An abdominal ultrasound was performed which showed an aneurysm measuring 5.3 cm in diameter in the infra-renal aorta. No thrombus or calcification of the aneurysm was observed  which suggested a high risk for rupture.  Treatment and Prognosis:  Given the size of the aneurysm and Mr. Johnson's symptoms  the interventional radiology took place. He underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) which involves placing a stent graft within the aneurysm to provide a new path for blood flow.   Post-operatively  Mr. Johnson is being closely monitored for any possible complications. The patient was started on a beta-blocker to control and maintain his blood pressure levels and reduce the stress exerted on the aneurysm site. He's also prescribed a statin to manage his cholesterol levels  which further decreases the chance of future aneurysm development.  Outlook:  With successful surgery and proper post-operative care  the prognosis is generally good for patients like Mr. Johnson. However  he needs to closely follow-up with his cardiologist for routine monitoring of the placed graft for possible leaks  enlargement or re-opening of the aneurysm  or any other complications. Also  lifestyle modification like balancing diet  exercising  maintaining a healthy weight  checking cholesterol levels  and managing BP is advised to prevent further cardiovascular issues.  In conclusion  Mr. Johnson's past smoking habits  hypertension  age and family history played a significant role in the development of his AAA. His case notes the importance of early detection  presentation  and intervention of aneurysms  particularly in high-risk patients."
10,9,17,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial17,Patient Identification: Mr. Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the ED with severe abdominal pain.   Medical History: The patient has a history of long-term cigarette smoking (averaging 2 packs daily for 50 years)  hypertension  and high cholesterol levels  currently controlled by medication. He admits to having a sedentary lifestyle due to recent retirement and confesses to a lifelong diet rich in fats and low in fiber. Despite his hypertension and high cholesterol  he claims compliance with medication but admits to irregular follow-ups. He hasn’t had an operation before and has no known drug allergies. His immunisations are up to date.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Smith complained of sudden onset of severe and constant lower back and abdominal pain  describing it as “tearing.” The pain began while eating breakfast in the morning  approximately three hours before arrival to the emergency room (ER). No known triggers or mitigating factors were identified.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient had a blood pressure of 145/90 mm Hg  pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius. His breathing showed no difficulty  but he was observed to have some abdominal distension and tenderness. He was also noted to have a pulsating mass in the middle and upper part of his abdomen.   Family History: Mr. Smith’s father died of a heart attack at 72  and his mother died from a stroke at 65. He has a younger sibling diagnosed with ischaemic heart disease.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Based on the combination of his symptoms  physical examination findings  and risk factors  he was suspected with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). A subsequent fast bedside ultrasound confirmed the suspicion revealing an abdominal aortic diameter of approximately 7 cm with evidence of free fluid in the abdomen. The diagnosis was therefore a ruptured AAA.   Discussion: Mr. Smith’s case directly corresponds with the understanding that the primary risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysms are age over 60  Caucasian race  male sex  history of smoking  and family history of AAA. His case particularly highlights the significant role of cigarette smoking in the development of an AAA. Besides  his history of hypertension contributes to the weakening of the arterial wall  causing them to dilate over time. The presentation of a pulsatile abdominal mass also seals the diagnosis of AAA.  Management Plan: Following the diagnosis  Mr. Smith was urgently referred to vascular surgery for emergency operative repair of the ruptured AAA. Furthermore  counseling regarding the importance of lifestyle modification  specifically smoking cessation  was provided. If successful  the patient will be scheduled for regular follow-ups to monitor his recovery.
10,9,18,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial18,Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a 68-Year-Old Male  Patient Profile: Mr. William  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presented with a complaint of intermittent abdominal and lower back pain.  Demographics: Mr. William lives in an urban area and retired two years ago as an office clerk. He lives alone after his wife passed away five years ago. He is a chronic smoker and has been smoking one pack of cigarettes every day for the last 35 years. He consumes alcohol moderately and has a BMI of 28.  Family History: He lost his father to cardiac arrest at the age of 70  and his mother died of a stroke at 75. His older brother underwent surgery for aortic aneurysm at the age of 62.  Past Medical History: Mr. William has a history of hypertension  diagnosed seven years ago  and manages it with daily medication. He was also treated and managed for high cholesterol five years back. He has no known allergies to food or medication.  Current Presentation: Following the symptoms  relevant clinical investigations were performed  showing an enlarged aorta of about 5.5 cm  confirming the diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Surprisingly  no signs of rupture was noted. His blood pressure was recorded as 165/90 mm Hg  and pain intensity was 5 on the pain scale.  Laboratory Findings: Blood and urine showed normal metabolic function. Lipid profile revealed high cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  Management: Considering the aneurysm's size  family history  and the presence of risk factors (hypertension  smoking  and high cholesterol)  a surgical approach by means of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has been decided as the most appropriate treatment. Mr. William will also need to make substantial lifestyle modifications  such as smoking cessation and maintaining a low-fat diet for cholesterol control and blood pressure management.  Follow-Up: Regular follow-ups are scheduled to monitor hypertension and aneurysm post-surgery  ensuring normal metabolic function and assessing lifestyle modifications. The patient will be referred to a dietitian for dietary plans and to a counselor for smoking cessation assistance.  Given his age  past medical history  and the size of the aneurysm  Mr. William's is considered a high-risk case. This case emphasizes the relevance of early detection and the critical role of lifestyle changes in managing such conditions. Moreover  it also accentuates the importance of family history in spotting individuals at risk.
10,9,19,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial19,Patient Information:   Mr. John  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented at our outpatient clinic with a complaint of intermittent abdominal and back pain residing mostly around his lower abdomen and lower back area  which has been ongoing for over four months. The pain does not radiate but increases with physical effort. He has no known allergies but has a 45-year history of heavy smoking  consuming about a pack a day  and quit smoking two years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally and has a sedentary lifestyle. He served in the military for 20 years.  Medical History:  His past medical history includes hypertension  for which he has been taking medication (Lisinopril) for the past 10 years. He is also on low-dose aspirin for generalized heart disease prevention. He experiences occasional heartburn and takes over the counter antacids. He also suffers from chronic lower back pain and takes Tylenol as needed. He has no known history of surgeries  transplants  or allergies.  Family History:   Within his family history  his father passed away at the age of 76 from a stroke  and his mother died at the age of 69 from breast cancer. He has one older brother who is living and has been diagnosed with peripheral vascular disease. There are no known genetic diseases in his family.  Recent Investigation:  Upon physical examination  an abdominal mass was palpable  especially when the patient was lying on his back. Initial blood tests were normal except for slightly raised cholesterol levels (250 mg/dL). An abdominal ultrasound revealed the presence of what appeared to be an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) of 5.5 cm  which was confirmed by the subsequent CT (computed tomography) angiography.  Management and Prognosis:  The patient was counselled about the risk of rupture due to the large size of the aneurysm and was advised for immediate surgical intervention. Medically  his hypertension was well managed. However  he was instructed to follow a low cholesterol diet due to his slightly higher cholesterol levels.  Informed consent was taken for elective open surgical repair (OSR)  and the surgery was conducted successfully. The patient had uneventful recovery post-operation and is currently being followed up in the outpatient clinic with routine ultrasound examinations every 6 months to ensure no further complications arise.  Given the patient’s history of tobacco use  he was advised to participate in a smoking cessation program to improve overall health and reduce risk factors related to vascular disease. With these measures in place  the patient's prognosis is cautiously optimistic  but he will need to continue regular check-ups to monitor his health.   This case has been presented with the patient's informed consent for educational purposes only. All identifying information has been changed to protect patient's identity. 
10,9,20,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial20,Case Presentation:  Patient Information:  Mr. J  a male  aged 67 years old  is a Caucasian who resides in Maryland  USA. He has been a lifetime non-smoker and consumes alcohol moderately. Mr. J is a retired mechanic and lives with his wife. His income is now fixed  derived mainly from his pension plan.  Chief Complaint:  Mr. J presented himself to the hospital complaining of unrelenting abdominal pain and lower back pain for six days. The pain increased gradually over a period and has been associated with mild shortness of breath.  Past Medical History:  Mr. J was diagnosed with hypertension ten years ago and has been on anti-hypertensive medication since then. He also has controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for approximately seven years. His last HbA1c count  tested three months ago  was 6.8%. He has history of occasional episodes of dyslipidemia and also had a cholecystectomy due to gall stone disease about a decade ago.   Family Medical History:  Mr. J's father died at the age of 73 from a stroke  and his mother died in her late 70s from ovarian cancer. He has two siblings; his older brother is living with cardiovascular disease  and his younger sister is clinically well.  Presenting Illness:  On physical examination  his vitals were stable but he appeared in distress due to pain. His abdomen was soft but tender at the mid-abdominal area with a detectable pulsating mass. Laboratory tests showed increased white blood cell count. A subsequent CT scan confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) 5.4 cm in diameter  beginning just below the renal arteries and extending just above the aortic bifurcation.  Next Step:  Since the AAA was larger than 5 cm and symptomatic  the patient was scheduled for an emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) after his admission into the hospital. During the pre-anesthetic evaluation  he was reported fit for surgery.  Summary:  This is a case of a 67-year-old male with a significant past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and dyslipidemia  which could have resulted in his current presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Regular screening and timely intervention may have possibly averted the condition escalating to this level. His family history of cardiovascular disease might have also played a role in his present condition  emphasizing the importance of genetic predisposition in AAA.
10,9,21,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial21,Patient Case Presentation  Demographics: Mr. J is a 67-year-old Caucasian man  an ex-smoker who lives alone  and was a truck driver prior to his retirement. He continues to drink alcohol occasionally and retired 2 years ago. He has been independent with his activities of daily living.  Medical History: Mr. J is known to have high blood pressure  hyperlipidemia  and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus which are managed with medication. Most recently  he has reported abdominal pain and back pain which is mild to moderate in intensity for the past 2 months. His GP referred him for an abdominal ultrasound for suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm due to his risk factors including smoking history  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and age. Upon his most recent appointment  the ultrasound confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm which is approximately 5.6 cm in diameter.  Family History: Mr. J's father died at 62 from a sudden heart attack and he reportedly also had an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He has two siblings; one brother who has high blood pressure and a sister who is relatively well with no major medical conditions reported.  Current Medication: • Metoprolol for hypertension • Simvastatin for Hyperlipidemia  • Metformin for Diabetes Mellitus type 2  Assessment: Mr. J is experiencing pain  most probably due to the expanding aneurysm. The fact that it is now over 5 cm in diameter signifies a higher risk for rupture and hence an emergency situation. This condition is potentially life-threatening and he needs surgery as soon as possible. In addition  his risk factors may not be fully controlled  which further increases his risk of aneurysm growth and rupture.  Plan of Care: The primary course of action would be endovascular repair of his abdominal aortic aneurysm. Prior to this  a full medical workup  including cardiac checks (given his hypertension and family history of sudden cardiac death)  will be conducted to ensure he is capable of undergoing the procedure. His medication regimen will be revisited post-surgery and further lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes and exercise will get initiated to help manage his current conditions and prevent further medical complications. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor progress and check for any post-surgery complications.
10,9,22,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial22,Patient Presentation:  Patient Details:   Mr. Lopez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  comes for a routine physical examination. He has a known history of hypertension  diagnosed five years ago  and hyperlipidemia  for which he has been under medication.  Demographics:   He retired from a career as a truck driver two years ago  is married  and has four adult children. Mr. Lopez is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago after 30 years of pack-a-day smoking. He drinks alcohol occasionally  mostly on social events. He claims to have an average diet and rare exercise due to chronic lower back pain.  Family History:   His father died of a heart attack at the age of 72  and his mother passed away at 76 due to colon cancer. His eldest brother has been treated for coronary artery disease  and a younger sister has type 2 diabetes.   Present Illness:  During his routine checkup  his primary care physician noticed a pulsatile mass upon palpating Mr. Lopez's abdomen. The physician referred him for an abdominal ultrasound  which revealed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 5.2 centimeters in diameter.  Physical Examination:  The patient appeared well and in no apparent distress on initial visual inspection. He had an overall BMI of 28. His vitals recorded a blood pressure of 142/85 mmHg  a heart rate of 82 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 16 per minute  and temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.  Diagnostic Evaluation:  Following his diagnosis of an AAA  Mr. Lopez was referred to a cardiovascular surgeon. A CT angiogram confirmed the presence of the 5.2cm infrarenal AAA  with no sign of rupture or dissection. His complete blood count  lipid panel  and renal and liver function tests were within normal limits  considering his age.  Current Therapy:  Mr. Lopez has been maintained on Lisinopril 20mg once daily for his hypertension and Atorvastatin 40mg once daily for his hyperlipidemia. No changes have been made to these medications following his AAA diagnosis.  Conclusion:  Given his sizeable aneurysm and family history of cardiovascular disease  Mr. Lopez is at risk for rupture  presenting a critical health situation. Appropriate steps regarding surveillance and potential repair  including endovascular repair or open surgical repair  will be discussed with him by the cardiovascular surgeon.  Future visits will monitor Mr. Lopez's AAA progression and evaluate the efficacy of the chosen treatment plan. Adjustments will be made to his hypertension and hyperlipidemia treatment as needed  and he will also be counseled on adopting a healthier lifestyle  including better dietary habits and regular  suitable exercise to further reduce his cardiovascular risk.
10,9,23,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial23,Patient Information:   Mr. James Thompson  a 68-year-old African-American male  presents with a diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Presenting Complaints:   Mr. Thompson visited the hospital for a routine health check-up. He mentioned occasional lower back pain and feeling a pulsating sensation in his abdomen.  Patient's Past Medical History:   Mr. Thompson has a sustained history of hypertension and high cholesterol for which he is taking antihypertensive medication and statins. He is a smoker  averaging about 10 cigarettes a day for the past 40 years. He has no known drug allergies. He has been admitted to the hospital previously for angina  for which he underwent angiography but no stents were placed.   Family History:  Mr. Thompson's father died from an aortic aneurysm  and his elder brother had an AAA repair several years ago. His mother had diabetes but lived to her late 80s.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  a pulsatile mass was palpable in the peri-umbilical area  and his blood pressure was slightly elevated at 150/85 mmHg.   Diagnostic Findings:  An abdominal ultrasound was carried out  which confirmed the diagnosis of AAA with the aneurysm measuring 5.5cm in diameter.  Discussion:  Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually asymptomatic until rupture  at which point the mortality is high. Risk factors for AAA include age over 65  male gender  smoking  and family history  all of which apply to Mr. Thompson. Given the size of Mr. Thompson's AAA (5.5 cm)  the risk of rupture is high.  Plan:  Mr. Thompson's significant medical history increases his surgical risk  but his AAA's size necessitates surgical involvement. Therefore  the plan includes referral to a vascular surgeon for evaluation for either open surgery or endovascular repair. It will also be vital for him to fully understand the importance of ongoing follow-up  lifestyle modifications like smoking cessation  maintaining a healthy diet  routine exercises  good blood pressure control  and taking medication as prescribed.  Education:  Educate Mr. Thompson on the necessity for surgical intervention  risks  and expected outcomes. He should understand the necessity for lifestyle changes  particularly quitting smoking  which is a significant risk factor for AAA expansion and rupture.

10,9,26,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial26,Patient Information:   A 68-year-old Caucasian male with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 was brought to our hospital by his wife due to a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain which he rates at 8 out of 10. The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension treated with amlodipine  hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin  and a 35-year history of smoking a pack of cigarettes every day (he quit 6 years ago). He has no history of cardiovascular disease  diabetes  or other chronic diseases.   History of Present Illness:  The patient stated the pain was sudden  did not radiate  and was unrelated to his eating habits or physical activity. Associated symptoms included light-headedness and cold sweats  and his wife noticed paleness. No history of hematemesis  melena  diarrhea  or constipation.  Family History:  In his family history  his father died in his early 60s due to a heart attack  and his maternal uncle had surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm in his late 60s. His sister and mother have hypertension  and his eldest son has an unknown heart condition.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  the patient had a BP of 160/90 mm Hg  a heart rate of 105 beats/min  a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min  and a temperature of 98.6 F. Abdominal examination showed a pulsatile mass. No signs of peripheral vascular disease were noticed.   Lab reports:  Lab data showed a slightly higher white blood cell count and kidney function tests were within normal limits.   Imaging and Diagnosis:   The abdominal ultrasound revealed a 6.5cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm. A contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed these findings  showing a large abdominal aortic aneurysm without signs of rupture but with signs of imminent risk.  Management Plan:   The urgent nature of the patient's condition led him to be rushed into emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  which is a type of less invasive surgery procedure that reduces the risk of complications and allows for faster recovery.   Discussion:  This case underscores the importance of noting the medical and family history of a patient  especially one who is male  of an advanced age  and with a history of smoking and hypertension  as these are known risk factors for developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm. A high index of suspicion and immediate validation of diagnosis prevents fatal outcomes in patients presenting with these risk factors and symptoms.   The patient will need to be counselled about the importance of regular medical follow-ups  lifestyle modifications and medication adherence to manage his hypertension  and regular monitoring of his aneurysm post-intervention.       
10,9,27,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial27,Patient Information: The patient  Mr. A  is a 70-year-old Caucasian male residing in Middleton  Wisconsin  U.S. He is a retired electrician and lives with his wife of 48 years  with regular visits from their children and grandchildren. He has a past medical history of hypertension  for which he has been taking medication for the past 15 years. He has never smoked but has a history of casual drinking. He underwent a hernia repair surgery 6 years ago. The patient has been generally healthy  with an average weight considered normal for his height and age.  Presenting Problem: Over the last month  Mr. A has been experiencing gradually worsening abdominal and lower back pain. The pain sometimes radiates down his back into his legs  worse after meals or after physical exertion. No associated chest pain  shortness of breath  or loss of consciousness is reported. There were no significant changes in bowel and urinary habits.  Family History: There is significant family history with his father dying of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 73  and his paternal uncle suffering from a similar condition. His mother died of breast cancer in her late 60s. He has one older brother who has diabetes and hypertension. His two children are healthy.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  a pulsatile mass was felt in the abdomen. His blood pressure was found to be 140/90 mmHg. Routine blood tests were within normal limits. An abdominal ultrasound was performed  which showed a 5.5 cm dilatation within the abdominal aorta suggestive of AAA.  Diagnosis:  Based on the history  physical examination  and findings in ultrasound  the patient was diagnosed with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.  Treatment & Management: Given his age and the size of the aneurysm Mr. A was considered for elective surgery to repair the aneurysm and prevent potential rupture. His hypertension needs to be better controlled before the surgery. His primary care physician and a vascular surgeon were consulted to discuss the potential risks and benefits  and to chalk out an effective management strategy. In the interim  he was advised to avoid strenuous activities and heavy lifting.  Patient Education: The patient was informed about the diagnosis. The need for surgery and the risks involved  including the potential for rupture and life-threatening hemorrhage were explained. The importance of regular monitoring and imaging of the aneurysm was emphasized. Mr. A was advised about the beneficial effects of a low-salt diet for hypertension control. Alcohol moderation  regular exercise  and medication compliance were advised.  Follow-up:  A one-week follow-up was scheduled to review the blood pressure control and talk about the possible date for surgery. The patient was also instructed to report immediately if symptoms worsen or if symptoms such as sudden severe abdominal or back pain  cold/hot and numb legs or sudden onset of nausea and vomiting appear  as these could indicate a rupture of the aneurysm. 
10,9,28,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial28,Patient Description  Mr. Smith is a 68-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the clinic after experiencing severe abdominal pain that has been escalating over the last few weeks. The patient is also experiencing accompanying lower back pain  an unusual pulsating sensation around the navel area  and noticeable weight loss. Mr. Smith is a retired construction worker. His BMI is 27  showing slight overweight. He is a former smoker having quit 10 years ago after a 30-year smoking history. He drinks moderately and has a diet characterized by red meat  dairy products  and high-sodium foods.  Past Medical History  Mr. Smith has a history of high cholesterol  hypertension  and arteriosclerosis. For these chronic conditions  he has been managing them using antihypertensive drugs and statins. He has no known drug allergies. He has no previous surgical history. Briefly  his hypertension and high cholesterol have been inadequately controlled  which might have contributed to the development and progression of his current condition.  Family History  In his family  there is a history of heart diseases. His father died from a heart attack at the age of 72  and his elder brother was recently diagnosed with coronary artery disease. No known family members have had an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Clinical Assessment  Upon physical examination  Mr. Smith appeared relatively well and engaged but looked a bit fatigued. The abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass above the umbilicus  characteristic of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Diagnosis and Treatment  An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis indicating a 5.5 cm AAA. Mr. Smith was immediately referred to the vascular surgeon to discuss treatment options due to the size of the aneurysm and the risk of rupture. Options presented to him included regular monitoring  medications or surgery  with surgery being the most viable due to the size of his aneurysm.   The patient is presently scheduled for endovascular surgical repair  which is less invasive and has a quicker recovery time compared to open surgical repair. The risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with Mr. Smith. He was advised to continue his antihypertensive medication and make meaningful dietary adjustments.  Given the inherent risk of AAA rupture  we scheduled a follow-up with his primary care physician to review his medication management and provide recommendations for healthier lifestyle changes. His family was advised on the possible genetic predisposition to cardiovascular diseases and was recommended to have regular check-ups  with an emphasis on vascular health.
10,9,29,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial29,Patient Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Name: Mr. Lawrence A. Sex: Male Age: 72 years old Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired police officer Location: New York  Presenting Problem:  Mr. A. presents with complaints of persistent dull pain in the middle and lower part of his abdomen along with back pain. These symptoms have been on and off for roughly a month  and more recently  have become persistent and more pronounced.  Past Medical History:  Mr. A. has a known diagnosis of moderate hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which have been controlled with medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin  respectively). He is also a 20-pack-year former smoker  having quit smoking 15 years ago. The patient also dealt with obesity in the past but lost considerable weight through diet and lifestyle modifications. He has not had any other surgical intervention in his life.  Family History:  Mr. A.'s father passed away from an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 76. His mother had a history of coronary artery disease and passed away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 81. He has two siblings  a 68-year-old brother with type 2 diabetes and a 70-year-old sister who is currently healthy.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  a pulsatile mass was noted in the abdomen. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed signs of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a diameter of 5.0 cm. Blood pressure was elevated at 150/90 mmHg  pulse rate regular at 75 bpm  respiratory rate 18 per minute  oxygen saturation 96% room air  and temperature 98.6 Fahrenheit. Blood examinations showed elevated levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins.  Diagnosis: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  possibly an unruptured one. Given the size of the aneurysm and the persistent abdominal and back pain reported by Mr. A  along with his family history of aortic aneurysm  immediate medical attention is warranted.   Treatment/Plan: Mr. A eligible for surgical intervention due to the diameter of his aneurysm  and the fact it's symptomatic also suggests a potentially higher risk of rupture. A consultation with a vascular surgeon is necessary to discuss endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or open aneurysm repair  which is considered based on the patient's overall health and aneurysm’s characteristics. Additionally  stricter control of his blood pressure is required  thus Lisinopril may need dose adjustment or a combination with other medication. Regular follow-ups are also needed to monitor overall health  lipid profile  and aneurysm's status if the patient opts for surveillance. Modifications to Atorvastatin may also be considered.   This case clearly shows the importance of proper management of risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and lifestyle choices in preventing the development and progression of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Presentation: In the emergency department  his blood pressure was 180/95 mmHg  and his pulse rate was 105 beats per minute. His lipid panel revealed high LDL cholesterol levels. A physical examination identified a pulsatile mass in the abdomen.   Diagnostics: An abdominal CT scan confirmed an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 7.5 cm. No signs of rupture were noted  but the size and symptoms suggested risk.  Treatment and Progress: Mr. Ivanov underwent an emergency endovascular aneurysm repair. His postoperative course was uneventful  and his blood pressure and blood glucose levels were monitored closely. He discharged home with instructions for close follow-up and continuation of his antihypertensive and diabetes medications. Lifestyle changes were aggressively promoted.   Given his family history of cardiovascular diseases  cholesterol levels  and personal history of hypertension and diabetes  Mr. Ivanov is at high risk of cardiovascular complications. His case will require regular follow-up visits and continued management of his risk factors  along with the monitoring of any potential aneurysm-related complications.   In summary  this case underscores the importance of early detection and management of risk factors related to abdominal aortic aneurysms in patients with multiple comorbidities.
10,9,31,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial31,Patient Details:  Mr. Jackson  a 75-year-old male  presented to the emergency department complaining of severe  constant abdominal pain. He describes the pain as the worst he has ever experienced and likened it to a tearing sensation felt mostly in the lower abdomen and posterior back area. Other symptoms include transient lightheadedness. He does not report any associated nausea  vomiting  or changes in his bowel habits.  Medical History:  Mr. Jackson has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which have been managed with medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin  respectively). He has a 45-pack year smoking history but quit smoking around ten years ago after a minor stroke. He also underwent an appendectomy at the age of 30. There is no history of diabetes  kidney disease  or any other systemic diseases.  Social History:  Retired mechanic  a widower  lives alone. Elder daughter checks in on him occasionally. Alcohol use limited to 1-2 glasses of wine during social gatherings.   Family History:  There is some revelation of vascular disease in his family. His father suffered and eventually died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture at the age of 80  whereas his brother had a history of peripheral arterial disease.  Clinical Assessment and Diagnosis:  On physical examination  Mr. Jackson appeared pale and diaphoretic. His blood pressure was noted to be 150/90 mmHg with an irregular pulse at 112 beats per minute. An audible abdominal bruit was detected with a palpable pulsatile mass on deep palpation in the upper abdominal area.  Given his age  smoking history  family history  and clinical presentation  a diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was suspected  and Mr.Jackson was immediately sent for an emergent abdominal ultrasound.  Findings showed a 6.2cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm with mural thrombus  confirming our suspicion of AAA. He was immediately scheduled for emergency surgery given his clinical presentation and the size of his AAA  which significantly increased his risk for rupture.   This case provides insight into the critical features of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  which include risk factors like age  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  and family history. AAA often remain asymptomatic until rupture  but when symptoms do occur  they generally include severe pain  hypotension  and a pulsatile abdominal mass. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are key to patient survival in these cases.

10,9,35,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial35,Patient Information: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male named John Doe living in New York City  with a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack-year smoking history. He is a retired mechanic and a veteran. His only immediate family is a son with no significant health issues.  Chief Complaint: Mr Doe came to the emergency department with a sharp  severe  non-radiating lower back and abdominal pain that began suddenly this morning. The pain was described as a pulsating sensation that started briefly after he finished his breakfast.  Past Medical History: Mr Doe's past relevant medical history includes long-standing hypertension  which has been relatively controlled with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. Hyperlipidemia (diagnosed a decade ago) is managed with statins. He is not diabetic  but he had a smoking history of 40 pack-years & quit smoking three years ago.  Family History: His father passed at 68 years old from heart disease  and his mother passed at 76 years old from old age. No family history of aortic aneurysms or any hereditary disease is reported.  Examination and Investigation: On physical examination  he was tachycardic  vital signs otherwise stable. His abdomen was tender  especially in the mid-abdominal region  and a pulsatile mass was palpable. A faint bruit could be heard on auscultation over the mass. The rest of the physical examination showed no abnormal findings.  His blood test showed normal complete blood count  renal function  and liver function. Lipid profile shows managed hyperlipidemia. CT scan revealed an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6 cm in diameter.  Diagnosis and Plan: An emergent diagnosis of a large  symptomatic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) was made. He was immediately referred for a surgical consult to discuss the possibility of emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). His case was further complicated by his hypertension and hyperlipidemia  but his current stable medical condition increases operability.  Estimated Outcomes and Prognosis: The patient  if managed promptly  stands a good chance at survival  although the risk of rupture is high given the size of the aneurysm and the associated symptoms. Post-recovery lifestyle modifications and medications (for hypertension and hyperlipidemia) will be necessary to prevent recurrence.
10,9,36,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial36,Patient Information: Our patient  Mr. John Smith  is a 72-year-old Caucasian male living in a suburban community. Mr. Smith  a former bank manager  is now retired and enjoys golfing and gardening. His Body Mass Index (BMI) is slightly over the average range at 26.8  suggesting he is slightly overweight. He has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. He consumes alcohol socially.  Presenting Problem: Recently  Mr. Smith reported symptoms of severe sharp and persistent abdominal pain  along with lower back pain. He also complained of feeling a pulsating sensation in his abdomen. There is an associated symptom of occasional dizziness but no vomiting  diarrhea  or fever.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension and has been on antihypertensive medications for over a decade. He also has hyperlipidemia  for which he takes statins. He was diagnosed with cardiovascular disease five years ago but has since been adequately managed. He has no known history of allergies or other surgical procedures  with the exception of an inguinal hernia repair about 15 years ago.  Family History: His father died from a stroke at the age of 67  and his mother suffered from chronic kidney disease. His older brother died at the age of 65 due to myocardial infarction.   Recent Findings: Due to the ongoing pain  he was taken to the hospital. An emergent CT scan revealed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) of about 5.5 cm. Preliminary laboratory results showed a mild elevation in his white blood cell counts indicative of possible infection or inflammation but otherwise normal.  Conclusion and Recommendations:  Mr. Smith was immediately taken up by the vascular surgery team because of the significant size of the aneurysm and decided to perform an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The procedure was successful  and his pain has notably subsided. He has been adviced to quit smoking. He was discharged with clean wound sites and educated about the signs and symptoms of complications such as increasing pain  swelling  redness  or drainage from the incision. He is scheduled for a follow-up to evaluate the effectiveness of the procedure. Furthermore  his family members have been advised to get regular check-ups considering the family history of cardiovascular disease and now AAA.
10,9,37,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial37,Patient Profile:  The patient under discussion is a 65-year-old Caucasian male known as Mr. A. The patient is retired and is currently living with his wife in a suburban locality. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  conditions he has been managing through regular medication for the past ten years. Mr. A is a former smoker  having quit cigarettes 20 years ago after predominantly heavy smoking in his early adulthood. He leads a sedentary lifestyle and has recently lost weight due to decreased appetite and stress.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. A presented with a recent history of persistent abdominal discomfort associated with lower back pain. The discomfort is not acute but has been noted to be gradually worsening over the past month. He reports no incidences of hematuria  bowel changes  or episodes of syncope.   Medical Evaluation and Diagnoses: Physical examination illuminated a pulsatile abdominal mass  and subsequent Ultrasound imaging confirmed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.6 cm in diameter. No signs of rupture or dissection were identified. Mr. A was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Family History: Mr. A’s father died of a heart attack at age 85  and his mother died of complications from pneumonia in her late '70s. He has one brother who was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease in his late 60s. There is no family history of any known connective tissue disorders.   Laboratory Tests:  Blood tests including full blood count  renal and liver function tests  and coagulation profile were within normal limits. Lipid profile shows elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels.   Counseling and Treatment Plan: Mr. A was counseled extensively about the nature of his diagnosis and the high risk associated with the aneurysm's rupture. As the AAA is more extensive than 5.5 cm  immediate surgical intervention was recommended after assessing Mr. A’s overall fitness and considering the balance between potential benefits and risks. A follow-up appointment was planned with the vascular surgery team for further assessment and to delineate a strategy for endovascular repair.  Patient Education: The patient was educated about lifestyle modifications  including dietary changes to manage his lipid profile  importance of regular exercise  and the implications of his diagnosis. Mr. A was advised to avoid heavy lifting and straining and monitor any significant changes in his symptoms  including severe abdominal or back pain  which can be a sign of rupture needing immediate medical attention.   Outlook: With appropriate surgical management and lifestyle modifications  the prognosis can be reasonably positive for Mr. A. However  he will need regular follow-ups to monitor the condition of the aneurysm and response to the suggested interventions.  This clinical scenario stresses the significant role of primary care providers in recognizing AAA in its early stages  allowing timely intervention  and potentially improving fatal outcomes. It also underlines the pivotal role of a comprehensive approach  encompassing psycho-social support and lifestyle modification counseling in managing such patients.
10,9,38,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial38,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named John. He is a retired construction worker who lives with his wife in urban NYC. John is a non-smoker but drank alcohol socially for around 20 years. He also did not engage in regular physical activity due to his strenuous job demands  contributing to his less than optimal health status.    Presenting Symptoms:  John presented to the emergency department with severe pain in the abdomen and both legs. He reported that the pain was sudden in onset and had been constant since. Upon investigation  he also was seen to be hypotensive and short of breath.   Medical History:  John has a known history of hypertension for the past 15 years  for which he takes daily medication. Additionally  he had been diagnosed with Type II diabetes five years ago and maintained average glucose control using oral hypoglycemics. There was also a record of hyperlipidemia about a year ago which has been managed by statin therapy.   Family History:  John's medical history seems to align with his family history  as both his father and paternal grandfather had hypertension and were diabetic. His father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 77 and passed away suddenly. His grandfather had also been diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm but passed away before the intervention could take place.   Diagnosis:  Given his symptoms and the tenderness revealed in his physical examination in combination with his medical and family history  John was suspected of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). An immediate abdominal ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis revealing an aortic aneurysm of 5.8 cm.   Management Plan:  The size of John's aneurysm and his symptomatology suggest he is at a high risk of rupture  necessitating immediate surgical intervention. Open surgical repair or endovascular aneurysm repair are both viable options depending on his overall health status and the surgeon's decision. Clinical guidelines recommend continued monitoring of his hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. Lifestyle modifications  including diet control and regular physical activity  are of parallel importance to manage his cardiovascular risk factors.   Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of vigilance and immediate action in patients with risk factors presenting with symptoms suggestive of AAA since ruptured AAA's have high mortality.
10,9,39,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial39,Patient Presentation  The patient is an 84 year old Caucasian male who has been diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history  but quit smoking 15 years ago.   Presenting Issue  The patient was referred to the vascular surgery clinic by his primary care physician following an incidental finding of an abdominal aortic aneurysm on an abdominal ultrasound done for investigating his chronic stomach pain. His aneurysm measures 5.5 cm  which happens to be over the threshold for surgical intervention.  History and Examination  His hypertension and hyperlipidemia are well controlled with long-standing (15+ years) medications - Lisinopril for his hypertension and Atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia. He has no history of diabetes or ischemic heart disease. His family history indicates a paternal uncle who had an aortic aneurysm. The patient also has intermittent claudication.   His physical examination is largely unremarkable except for a pulsatile mass detected in the epigastric region on palpation. The patient denies any recent weight loss  change in bowel habits  or gastrointestinal symptoms.  Imaging and Lab Findings  An abdominal CT scan confirmed the presence of an AAA  measuring 5.5 cm in diameter. His labs revealed a WBC count of 9 000/uL  hemoglobin of 14 g/dL  and platelet count of 250 000/uL. His kidney and liver functions were normal. He had an LDL cholesterol of 120 mg/dL and triglyceride level of 150 mg/dL.  Impression  The patient’s history  along with physical examination and imaging findings  confirm the diagnosis of AAA. His risk factors include advanced age  being male  history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a positive family history. His symptoms of chronic abdominal pain and intermittent claudication warrant a surgical consultation.  Plan  Considering his age and the size of the AAA  a referral to vascular surgery for discussion regarding endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) versus open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair would be appropriate. The patient also needs regular follow-ups and lifestyle modification advice with the initiative to maintain optimal control over his hypertension and cholesterol levels. We will also revisit the pharmacotherapeutic strategies to manage his chronic diseases to see if we can mitigate the risk further. He must also receive a thorough pre-operative risk assessment by his cardiologist considering his age and medical status.
10,9,40,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial40,Case Presentation Patient Information: Mr. J. Smith is a 69-year-old male veteran  residing in Manchester  NH.   Chief Complaint: Mr. Smith recently presented to the clinic complaining of persistent abdominal and lower back pain lasting for more than two weeks.    Historical Overview: The patient has a medical history of hypertension  for which he actively takes medication. Moreover  he is a former smoker  having quit five years ago after a history of 40 pack years.   Family History: There is a significant family history as his father died at the age of 65 due to complications after emergency surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Medical Examination and Diagnostic Testing: On clinical abdominal examination  it was noticed that his abdomen was mildly distended and a pulsatile mass was felt. No bruit was audible on auscultation. The patient's lower extremities showed no signs of ischemia  and pulses were palpable bilaterally.  An ultrasonogram showed a 5.6 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm. The diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm was then confirmed via a CT scan  indicating an impending risk of rupture due to aneurysm exceeding 5 cm.  Treatment: Considering his age  size of the aneurysm  the risk of rupture  and patient's surgical risk as per his baseline morbidity factors  it was decided to perform an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).  A multidisciplinary team including a vascular surgeon  anesthesiologist  and interventional radiologist was formed to perform the EVAR.   Discussion: Informed consent for the surgery was obtained after explaining to Mr. Smith about the risks and benefits of the procedure. The procedure went on without any complications  and post-operative recovery was uneventful. He was discharged on the fifth postoperative day.  The patient is currently under regular follow-ups with his vascular surgeon to monitor for any complications related to the surgery and is prescribed medication for his hypertension to reduce stress on the aorta.   Mr. Smith’s case underscores the importance of considering AAA in differential diagnosis in older male patients with a history of smoking and family history of AAA presenting with abdominal and back pain.

Present Illness History: Mr. W reported sudden severe lower back pain that started 24 hours earlier. He reported it being a distinct  sharp and constant pain which escalated while moving  coughing  or taking deep breaths. No noticeable changes in the pattern of urination or bowel movement. He denies having nausea  vomits  or appetite loss.  Past Medical History: A 10-year history of hypertension and a 5-year history of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Otherwise  he lives a relatively healthy lifestyle; he does not smoke nor consumes alcohol. No history of any surgical procedures in the past.  Family History: His father died due to a heart attack at the age of 75  and his mother had a history of stroke and died at 80. His brother  currently 72  underwent surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 65.  Physical Examination: The patient appeared distressed due to pain. Vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  pulse rate of 80 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and temperature of 36.6 degrees Celsius. Abdominal examination showed a palpable pulsating mass in the midline of the abdomen along with tenderness.  Investigations: Given his sudden severe pain  associated family history  and hypertension  Mr. W was immediately recommended for ultrasound which confirmed a 6.5 cm aneurysm in the abdominal aorta. Blood tests reported mild anemia and marginally elevated creatinine level.  Management: He was immediately referred for surgical consultation due to the large size of the aneurysm and sudden onset of severe pain indicating risk of imminent rupture. The vascular surgeon recommended an urgent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Following the procedure  the patient recovered well.  Follow-up: Mr. W will undergo regular ultrasound examinations to monitor the status of the aneurysm repair  and management of hypertension and diabetes with medication and lifestyle modifications will continue.  This case highlights the importance of early detection and intervention in abdominal aortic aneurysm  particularly in patients with family history and other risk factors  such as hypertension  to prevent fatal complications.
10,9,42,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial42,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male with an abdominal aortic aneurysm diagnosed during a routine medical examination. The patient initially came in with regular complaints of mild abdominal discomfort and lower back pain. He is currently a retired engineer  residing in Illinois  USA  with his spouse. He's been a non-smoker for the last ten years. He consumes alcohol moderately.  Medical History:  On review of his past medical history  he has been treated for moderate hypertension for the last 15 years. No prior surgeries or hospitalizations have been reported. He admits non-compliance with prescribed antihypertensive medication. He is also noted to have Dyslipidemia. Nevertheless  he is not diabetic and does not suffer from any chronic kidney disease. His functional status had been independent prior to this diagnosis.  Physical Examination:  Vital signs are normal  and BMI is 29; indicating overweight phenotype. Examination of his vitals indicates a palpable  pulsating mass in the abdomen. Otherwise  the rest of the exam  including the cardiovascular and respiratory system  is normal.  Family History:  His father died at the age of 72 due to myocardial infarction and was diagnosed with an abdominal aneurysm in his late 60s. His mother is alive and well at 85  but she is treated for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has two siblings  both are alive and have a history of hypertension.  Imaging:  An abdominal ultrasound revealed a large infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring 6.5 cm in diameter  extending to the aortic bifurcation.  Management Plan:  Taking into account the size of this aneurysm and his family history  there are significant risks of rupture and internal bleeding  so consultation with a vascular surgeon was made for possible surgical intervention. Concurrently  the patient’s hypertension and hyperlipidemia were managed more aggressively to mitigate further complications. Smoking cessation and reduced alcohol intake were also emphasized in addition to dietary and lifestyle modifications.  Prognosis:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm poses a serious health risk to the patient and requires immediate management to reduce morbidity and mortality. Adherence to treatment plans and lifestyle modifications is essential for this patient’s prognosis. Continued monitoring and follow-up will also be necessary after the surgery.   Consents for the surgery have been obtained  and the patient was scheduled for an endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). The patient and his wife seemed grateful for the explanation and plan and were reassured about the continuity of care.
10,9,43,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial43,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presents with a history of intermittent  severe abdominal pain  and lower back pain. He also recently experienced unusual fullness after eating small meals  unexplained weight loss  and noticed a pulsating mass in his stomach.   Past Medical History: He has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both under management for the past ten years. Mr. Smith was a heavy smoker for many years but succeeded in quitting ten years ago. He has a moderate alcohol intake. He also has a history of peripheral artery disease and coronary artery disease  for which he underwent angioplasty three years ago.  Family History: He revealed a family history of cardiovascular diseases  including his father who died at the age of 72 from a heart attack  and a brother who underwent surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 65.  Physical Examination: On the physical examination  a pulsatile  expansile  and tender mass was detected in the central and upper part of the abdomen. No significant lower limb ischemia or peripheral pulses were missed.  Investigations: Upon obtaining a complete blood count  liver function tests  kidney function tests  and coagulation profile  all parameters appeared within the normal range. Lipid profile showed elevated LDL levels. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a 5.4 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Management and Follow-up: Given the size of the AAA and symptoms  he was referred to a vascular surgeon for further assessment and management. His current medications - which include antihypertensives and statins - were reviewed  with suggestions to optimize his blood pressure and lipid levels. Information about the significance of lifestyle changes was reinforced  including maintaining a balanced diet and consistent physical exercise. Long-term follow-up plans were constructed for regular surveillance of the aneurysm and ongoing management of his cardiovascular risk factors.  This case underpins the significance of early detection and management of abdominal aortic aneurysms  particularly among patients with known cardiovascular diseases or significant family histories. It serves as an important reminder that aneurysms may be asymptomatic until complications occur  emphasizing the role of vigilant monitoring and early intervention.
10,9,44,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial44,Case Presentation  Demographics: John Doe is a 68-year-old Caucasian man  retired  and has never smoked. He lives with his wife of 40 years in the suburbs. He is 6' tall  weighs 250lbs  and is thus classified as obese. He was referred by his GP to our vascular clinic due to a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a known history of controlled hypertension  diagnosed 15 years ago  treated with lisinopril. He also has mild hypercholesterolemia  treated with statins  and type 2 diabetes managed with metformin for the last 10 years. He had an appendectomy at age 20  and a knee replacement at 60 due to osteoarthritis. No known allergies to medications.  Family History: His father died of a heart attack at 72  and his mother is still alive at 90  with Alzheimer's. He has one older brother who died from ruptured AAA at age 70. No history of any other heritable diseases in the family.  Presentation: Mr. Doe claims to be asymptomatic  no abdominal or back pain  no frequent urination or other urinary changes. His last physical exam  including a digital rectal exam and urinalysis  was 6 months ago  all within normal limits. However  on today's physical examination  a pulsatile mass in the abdomen was palpable  and bruit could be heard upon auscultation.  Imaging: Ultrasound was performed  which showed an AAA of about 5.5 cm in maximum diameter. Follow-up CT angiography confirmed this  showing an infrarenal AAA  with no apparent signs of rupture.    Plan: The AAA size indicates a high risk for rupture  hence we will admit Mr. Doe for elective surgery to repair the aneurysm. Preoperative optimization  including glycemic control and ensuring adequate blood pressure control  will be done. AAA repair options will be discussed with Mr. Doe  including open repair and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  considering his age and health condition.   Education: Mr. Doe and his wife will be educated about AAA and surgical options  including potential complications and lifestyle modifications post-surgery. Post-operative screening for other vascular aneurysms will also be explained given the family history.  A multidisciplinary team  including Cardiology  Endocrinology  and Anaesthesiology  will be involved in his care to ensure optimal management planning and postoperative recovery.   Follow-up: John will be followed up in the vascular clinic after surgery. Regular surveillance and lifestyle changes will be strongly recommended to reduce the risk of further vascular events.
10,9,45,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial45,Patient Profile: Mr. Robert Johnson; Gender: Male; Age: 65 years; Race: Caucasian; Occupation: Retired engineer; Marital status: Married  three children; Location: Oklahoma City  OK  USA.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient reported to the Emergency Department with complaints of severe  sharp  and constant abdominal pain radiating towards the back.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past 10 years. He is a smoker  with 40 pack years of smoking history. He has also been suffering from hyperlipidemia which is being managed through medications for the past 8 years. He had an appendectomy at the age of 30. No history of diabetes or any other disease.  Family History: Both of his parents suffered from cardiovascular problems. His father died due to myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and his mother passed away due to stroke at 75. Two of his siblings also have a history of hypertension.  Clinical Findings: On examination  a pulsatile mass was palpable in the abdomen  slightly to the left of the midline. His blood cholesterol level was found to be elevated. Other laboratory results were from within normal limits.  Diagnostic tests and Progress: An abdominal ultrasound was recommended based on the initial examination  which showed a dilatation of the abdominal aorta exceeding 3cm in maximum diameter. A contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed afterward which confirmed the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.5 cm.  Management and Prognosis: As the aneurysm was above the threshold size  the patient was recommended for immediate surgical intervention considering the risk of rupture along with him being symptomatic. He underwent successful open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. His recovery was uneventful. He was advised to quit smoking and was given medication to manage his hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. He was advised for regular follow-ups and to immediately report any kind of severe abdominal or back pain.  Education: The patient and his family were educated about the condition and the risk factors  importance of medication adherence  need for regular follow-ups  and adopting a healthy lifestyle.  This summarizes the case of Mr. Johnson with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His management is ongoing  and a concerted approach is required to minimize the risk of other cardiovascular events given his family history and past medical history.
10,9,46,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial46,Patient Profile: ---- Patient Initials: J.L. Gender: Male Age: 68 years old Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Retired truck driver Location: Rural North Carolina.  History of Present Illness: ---  The patient  Mr. J.L.  presented at the hospital after experiencing sudden and severe lower back pain for the last 24 hours. He reports the pain is constant and does not alleviate with rest or over-the-counter NSAIDs. The pain is described as a sharp pain radiating to the abdomen and lower extremities. He denies any trauma or injury and had been in his usual state of health before the onset of the pain. In addition  he has been feeling lightheadedness and fatigue for the past few days. He has not noticed any hematochezia  melena  or changes in bowel habits. There is no history of recent weight changes  fever  or chills.  Past Medical History: ---  J.L. has a significant past medical history of hypertension  high cholesterol  and a 40-pack-year smoking habit. He also has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2. His medications include insulin  metformin  lisinopril  and Lipitor. He quit smoking about ten years back  following a minor stroke (for which he is on a daily aspirin regimen).   Family History: ---  His father died of a heart attack at the age of 64  and his mother has hypertension and diabetes. He has two brothers  one of whom underwent surgical repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm some years ago. There is  therefore  a strong family history of cardiovascular disease.  Physical Examination: ---  The examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass on palpation. His blood pressure and heart rate readings were 150/100 mmHg and 98 beats per minute  respectively. The examination of his cardiovascular  pulmonary  and remaining gastrointestinal systems was unremarkable.   Diagnostic Assessment: ---  Based on the examination findings and the patient’s history  an abdominal ultrasound was ordered which confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  measuring 5.5 cm in diameter.   Plan: ---  Given the size of the aneurysm and the sudden onset of symptoms  surgical intervention is required promptly. The risk of rupture is high  and mortality rates are dramatically increased upon rupture. The patient is referred to a vascular surgeon for an elective open repair of the abdominal aorta.  Discussion: ---  This case emphasizes the importance of considering abdominal aortic aneurysm in patients with a pertinent history of cardiovascular disease  smoking  hypertension  and familial predisposition. While open surgical repair is a common approach  modern procedures like endovascular stent grafts could also be considered depending on the patient's overall health condition and surgical risk.
10,9,47,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial47,Patient Presentation  Mr. Stanley  a 68-year-old African-American male  was referred for evaluation due to an incidental finding of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) on a routine abdominal ultrasound. His chief complaint was intermittent  non-specific abdominal discomfort for the past few weeks  which he initially associated with gastric issues.  Past Medical History In his medical history  Mr. Stanley was diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus eight and ten years ago  respectively. Other conditions he has been managing include mild osteoarthritis  for which he occasionally uses non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  and well-controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) secondary to a 40 pack-year smoking history  which he discontinued 5 years ago.  Family History Family history reveals both his father and a paternal uncle underwent surgery for AAAs. His mother had hypertension and died from a stroke at an age of 73. His two elder brothers are alive with diabetes and cardiac diseases.  Social History Mr. Stanley is a retired plumber  married with two children. He quit smoking five years ago  he rarely drinks alcohol  and he’s a member of a local walking group.  Physical Examination On examination  he appears his stated age and is in no acute distress. He is afebrile  with a blood pressure of 146/92 mmHg  heart rate of 78 beats per minute  respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute  and BMI of 29. Palpation confirmed a pulsatile mass in his abdomen.  Investigations and Diagnosis Results from an abdominal CT scan revealed a 5.5-cm infrarenal AAA with no evident leak. His laboratory findings  including complete blood counts  kidney and liver function tests  were within normal range except for slightly elevated glucose and HbA1c levels  suggesting inadequately controlled diabetes.   Management  Given his diagnosis of a large AAA  family history  and risk factors (including advanced age  hypertension  history of smoking and COPD)  he has been referred for consideration of surgical intervention. His diabetes and hypertension management will also need to be reassessed to minimize perioperative and long-term risks. He was advised to continue his exercise habits but to avoid strenuous activities which might precipitate rupture until the AAA is managed.  Follow-up Mr. Stanley will be seen again in a week to discuss his surgical options after an anesthesia evaluation. He will also follow-up with his primary care physician concerning hypertension and diabetes control.   This case advocates for the importance of recognizing risk factors  family history  and early detection of AAA especially in patients who might otherwise attribute their symptoms to less serious conditions.
10,9,48,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial48,Case Presentation:   Patient Information: Mr. Conway  a 75-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with severe sharp abdominal pain. He is a retired car mechanic  currently living with his wife.   Medical History: Mr. Conway has a significant medical history of hypertension and Hyperlipidemia. He had been previously chronic on Norvasc 10mg for hypertension and Lipitor 40mg for hyperlipidemia. He smoked heavily during his early adulthood and quit two decades ago. He described his alcohol intake as occasional and did not admit to any illicit drug use.   Family History: His father succumbed to a myocardial infarction at the age of 62 and his oldest brother was successfully treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) six years ago.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  he was sweaty and anxious. His blood pressure was slightly elevated at 150/95 mmHg  with a pulse rate of 90 bpm. An abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the midline of the abdomen. Bowel sounds were normoactive and there was no guarding or rigidity of the abdominal muscles.  Investigations: An urgent abdominal ultrasound showed a maximum infrarenal aortic diameter of 8cm  compatible with AAA. On contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis  the aneurysm was confirmed  and signs of active leak were identified.  Vascular Surgery Consultation: Considering the patient’s significant smoking history  his obvious large AAA and his brother’s successfully treated AAA  vascular surgeons were consulted immediately.   Diagnosis: Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Plan: Mr. Conway will be admitted for emergency endovascular aortic repair. His wife will be informed. His old medications  Norvasc and Lipitor  will be continued. Pain management will be carried alongside. He will be advised to monitor BP at home and adhere to high-fiber  low-cholesterol diet and regular gentle exercises after recovery.  Prognosis and Course: Prognosis will depend on the successful repair of the aorta  potential complications  and his compliance with postoperative instructions and medications. If all goes well  he could have a good quality of life.   Follow up: Post-surgery  Mr. Conway would require close monitoring and routine follow-ups to check for potential complications and monitor his overall health status. Strict control and lifelong pharmacotherapy of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia is required  considering the significant risk these conditions pose on his cardiovascular system. 
10,9,49,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial49,Case Summary:  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male by the name of Robert Smith  who was referred to our Cardiology Department by his primary care physician for further evaluation of a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a past medical history of untreated hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 30-pack year smoking history. He gave up smoking 5 years ago. He also has a history of occasional chest pain and shortness of breath upon exertion  which he attributes to his advanced age and previous smoking history. There are no known allergies. He is on Lisinopril for his hypertension and Statin for hyperlipidemia.  Family History: The patient’s father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 75. His younger brother  now 70  had an AAA repair 4 years ago. He reported no history of any vascular or heart diseases in his children.  Current Presentation:  The patient's AAA was incidentally discovered during a routine ultrasound of his kidney  which was ordered for his chronic kidney disease monitoring. The AAA measures approximately 4.5 cm in maximum diameter. The patient is asymptomatic  reporting no abdominal  back  or flank pain  and no recent episodes of syncope or near syncope.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  the patient was found to be essentially stable. He is normotensive and afebrile. His abdomen is non-distended with normal bowel sounds and no noticeable pulsatile mass upon palpation.  As the AAA is approaching the intervention threshold size of 5.5 cm  a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the abdomen and pelvis is planned for better characterization of the aneurysm  and to evaluate his overall vascular health.  With the patient’s remarkable family history and personal history of significant risk factors for AAA  including advanced age  Caucasian race  history of smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  he is at a high risk of rupture. The intervention plan shall be discussed further considering his overall physical status and health. In addition  lifestyle modifications along with good control of his blood pressure and cholesterol level might be encouraged.  Future appointments and monitoring plans are in discussion  given the continuous evolution of the patient's condition. At the moment  close surveillance with a repeating ultrasound in 6 months  or earlier if he develops any symptoms suggestive of expansion or rupture of his AAA  would be prudent. If the AAA reaches the threshold size earlier or if the patient becomes symptomatic  the decision to proceed with intervention shall be made accordingly.
10,9,50,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial50,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 70-year-old African-American male residing in Houston  Texas. He is a retired mechanical engineer and has been living alone since his wife's death five years ago. He has two sons  both of whom are in different states  and he visits them alternatively.  Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been prescribed a beta-blocker (Metoprolol) and an ACE inhibitor (Lisinopril) for hypertension and a statin (Atorvastatin) for hyperlipidemia. He has been compliant with the medications. He has no history of diabetes mellitus  kidney disease  or thyroid disorders but has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily since his early 20’s. He quit smoking three years ago when he first felt discomfort in his back.  Present Symptoms:  The patient came to the clinic complaining of constant low back pain that has been progressively worsening for the last six months. He also complained of occasional abdominal discomfort but denied any recent weight loss  loss of appetite  or changes in bowel movements.  Family History:  His mother died at the age of 78 due to complications following a stroke  and his father underwent a successful surgical aortic aneurysm repair at the age of 65 and died at 80 from an unrelated cause.  Diagnosis:  Upon physical exam  a pulsating mass was noticed in the abdomen  prompting an ultrasound that confirmed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) of 5.5 cm in diameter.  Case Details:  This is a case of AAA in a patient with risk factors of age over 65 years  history of smoking  hypertension  and a family history of AAA. The patient's size of aneurysm and symptomatic presentation puts him in a high-risk category. Guidelines recommend immediate consultation with a vascular surgeon for consideration of repair in patients with AAAs with a diameter of 5.5 cm or more  symptomatic AAAs  or rapidly enlarging AAAs. His case will be managed accordingly.  Plan:  The patient has been informed of the diagnosis and risks related to AAA. He is referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation and to determine whether endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or open surgical repair would be more appropriate considering the patient's age and overall health condition.  Recommendation:  The patient will be advised to continue his medication for hypertension and hyperlipidemia to mitigate the risk of rupture and to facilitate post-surgery recovery. Additionally  maintaining a balanced diet  light physical activity  and regular follow-ups will be recommended. If he requires surgery  pre-surgical assessment by a team of specialists will be arranged to ensure his readiness for the procedure  and post-surgical care will be planned accordingly.
10,9,51,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial51,Patient Initials: J.D Sex: Male Age: 65 years old Occupation: Retired mail carrier Ethnicity: Caucasian   Presenting Problem  J.D. arrived at the emergency room with a primary complaint of intermittent sharp and severe abdominal pain for the past two days  which was radiating to his back.  Medical History   J.D. was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago and has been consuming anti-hypertensive medications since then. He was also diagnosed with borderline diabetes five years ago. However  he did not require medication for this and was instructed on lifestyle modifications. He is a chain smoker with a history of a 20 pack-year smoking habit. He also consumes alcohol moderately.  As far as his surgical background  he underwent an appendectomy in his youth but has no other significant surgeries and has no known allergies.  Family History   J.D. reported a family history significant for heart disease. His father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 60  and his mother has chronic hypertension. His older brother died of stroke in his early 60s. J.D. also mentioned that a cousin was treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Clinical Findings  On examination  J.D. had a slightly elevated blood pressure (160/95 mmHg). There is palpable and pulsatile mass in his abdomen. His peripheral pulses were symmetrically present. Laboratory results showed a slightly elevated cholesterol level. An ultrasound of the abdomen was performed revealing an abdominal aortic aneurysm that measures approximately 5.3cm in diameter.   Conclusion and Plan  J.D. diagnosis was Marfan Syndrome  which is at high risk for aortic dissection or rupture  therefore the recommended plan was immediate surgical intervention. Post-surgery  J.D would likely be setup on a regimen to manage his risk factors  including lifestyle modifications (cessation of smoking  diet control for diabetes)  medications for hypertension and cholesterol  as well as regular follow-up for monitoring any further dilation of the aorta.
10,9,52,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial52,Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  a 70-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Complaint: Severe abdominal pain with occasional back pain.  Past Medical History: He has been diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol levels ten years ago. He was a smoker for 30 years but quit five years ago.  Family History: His father died of a stroke at the age of 76. There's a history of cardiovascular disease on his maternal side.  Examinations and Tests: Physical examinations revealed a slightly pulsating abdominal mass. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 6 cm in diameter. The computed tomography (CT) scan further confirmed the location  extension  and diameter of the aneurysm.  Current Medications: Currently  he is on medication for hypertension (amlodipine 5 mg daily) and hypercholesterolemia (simvastatin 40 mg daily).  Relevant Information: Given his history of long-term smoking  the patient is at an elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases. His age and the history of hypertension also make him vulnerable to conditions such as AAA.  Diagnosis: Based on imaging tests  Mr. Doe has been diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Treatment Plan: Prompt surgical repair of the aneurysm is planned considering its size (6cm) to prevent rupture. He will undergo an open surgical repair or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  depending on the surgical team's assessment. His blood pressure and cholesterol levels need to be optimally controlled before surgery.  Follow-up Plan: Mr. Doe will need periodic monitoring post-operation  with an ultrasound examination every 6-12 months to detect any graft complications or aneurysm recurrence. He will also continue his antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medication  with regular blood pressure and cholesterol checks. His immediate family members  particularly male siblings and offspring  should also consider early screening for AAA due to the revealed family history.  Risks and Complications: AAA surgery carries risks  including heart attack  kidney damage  and infection. Post-surgery  Mr. Doe will need to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle  which includes a nutritious diet  regular exercise  quitting alcohol  and routine follow-up.  Patient Education: Mr. Doe was informed about his condition  the need for surgery  and the importance of maintaining a heart-healthy lifestyle post-operation. The family was also advised about the increased risk in immediate relatives and the need for early AAA screening.  Informed Consent: The patient understood his diagnosis and the need for surgical intervention. He has given written consent for surgery  and possible risks and complications were explained to him.
10,9,53,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial53,Patient Presentation  Patient Initials: J.K.        Sex: Male Age: 67 Race: Caucasian   Presenting Problem  J.K. presented himself to the emergency department following the sudden onset of severe lower back and abdominal pain. The pain was described as both sharp and tearing  radiating to the back and persisting for over two hours.  Past Medical History  J.K. has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both well controlled with medications. He also has a past history of tobacco use  having smoked for 30 years before quitting 10 years ago. There is no known diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  diabetes mellitus or any other significant maladies. He had a coronary artery disease diagnosed 5 years ago and he underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).   Family History  The patient's father died at age 70 due to myocardial infarction and his mother at age 72 due to stroke. He has one older brother who is still alive and well. There is no family history of cancer  but a significant family history of hypertension and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  Social History  The patient is a retired engineer. He is presently married  and he and his wife have three adult children in good health. Although he stopped smoking a decade ago  J.K. has a history of heavy alcohol intake  but for the last five years  he does light-to-moderate drinking.  Objective Evaluation  Upon physical examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable. The patient appeared sweaty and in distress due to pain. Blood pressure was found to be in the hypertensive range at 160/100 mmHg and heart rate was slightly elevated at 90 beats per minute.  Relevant Tests and Results  An urgent abdominal ultrasound was performed  revealing an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 5.5 cm in diameter. CT angiogram confirmed the large infrarenal AAA without evidence of rupture  dissection or thrombosis.  Plan  Immediate surgical consultation was sought. The surgical team recommended an emergent open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair given the size of the aneurysm and the severe pain of the patient  suspecting an impending rupture. The patient was emergently taken to the operating room  where the aneurysm repair was successfully performed.  Outcome  J.K. made an excellent recovery and was discharged home after seven days. He has been referred to outpatient vascular clinic and physiotherapy. He was strongly advised to follow up regularly and adhere to his medications  especially antihypertensives  statins and antiplatelet agents. He was also provided with education regarding lifestyle modification including healthy diet  regular exercise and avoidance of alcohol abuse.   Informed written consent was taken from the patient for all the procedures. Compliance to medication regimen and lifestyle modification  as well as regular follow-ups  were stressed upon to prevent any possible future cardiovascular event.   Future Plans  Future plan includes yearly monitoring of another smaller aneurysm found in the common iliac artery during the CT angiogram  which will be managed conservatively unless it reaches a size of 3 cm or more. Given his family history  the patient was also advised to have his adult children screened for familial aneurysm syndromes. 
10,9,54,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial54,Patient Information:  John  a 73-year-old Caucasian male presented with a two-day history of severe lower back pain which intensifies with movement. He is currently living alone in an urban setting.  Past Medical History: John has an existing diagnosis of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which he has been managing with medication (Lisinopril 20mg and Atorvastatin 10mg  respectively) for the past 10 years. Additionally  John has a 40-year history of cigar smoking  though he quit approximately seven years ago.  Present Illness: He reports a recent unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the past month and indistinct  persistent gastric discomfort. He mentions that he has been frequently fatigued and experienced a couple of episodes of fainting in the recent past. Upon physical examination  a pulsating mass of about 3 cm in diameter was palpated in his abdomen.  Investigations:  Further evaluation through an abdominal ultrasound confirmed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) of 5.5 cm. A CT angiogram further revealed an infrarenal AAA with no evidence of rupture. Blood pressure upon admission was 180/90 mmHg  and all laboratory investigations  including complete blood count  renal function  and coagulation profile  were within normal range.  Family History: John mentions that his late father was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm in his late 60s  which was successfully managed through surgical intervention.   Management and Intervention:  John was immediately admitted hospital for monitoring. The case was discussed with the vascular surgeon who recommended an elective open surgical repair  taking into account the size of the aneurysm and John’s overall health status. In the meantime  medications were adjusted to better control his blood pressure. He was prescribed Amlodipine 5mg daily  considering his elevated blood pressure readings.   Conclusion:  John’s history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and past smoking habit  apart from his genetic predisposition due to the family history of AAA  contributed to the development of his condition. His case demonstrates the importance of regular health checks for early detection and proper management of cardiovascular conditions  particularly in individuals with multiple risk factors.
10,9,55,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial55,Patient Presentation:  Name: Robert Fox Age: 72 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Lawyer  Medical History: Robert Fox is a 72 years old Caucasian male who has presented with persistent abdominal pain and discomfort for the past one week. Past medical records reveal a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 30-year smoking history  although the patient quit smoking 10 years ago. There is no significant history of diabetes  asthma  tuberculosis  or hepatitis. He takes antihypertensive medication and statins.   Robert does not drink alcohol and leads a fairly sedentary lifestyle. His last regular physical examination was conducted six months ago when all laboratory findings were within normal range. Specific to the current symptoms  there is no associated fever  vomiting  melena  and changes in bowel habits.  Family History: Robert's paternal uncle had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that was surgically treated  and his mother died of stroke. There is a significant family history for cardiovascular disease with his father having a myocardial infarction at 68 years.  Clinical Evaluation:  On examination  Robert was afebrile with a blood pressure of 145/90. Notably  a pulsating mass was perceptible in the abdomen. The remainder of his physical examination was largely unremarkable.   Investigations: Given Robert’s age  symptoms and family history  an abdominal ultrasound was performed that indicated a 5.3 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. Vitals were stable throughout with no signs of impending rupture.   Conclusion: Robert has been scheduled for elective repair by open surgery given the size of his aneurysm and his general good health. He has been educated about the symptoms of rupture  which would require immediate hospitalization and emergency surgery. Post intervention  he will require close follow-up  and lifestyle modifications  particularly regarding his hypertension and hyperlipidemia have been stressed. He has also been recommended for a vascular surgery consult to assess the feasibility of endovascular repair.  With a calculated surgical risk  open repair or endovascular repair offers the best hope for a permanent cure and Robert appears to understand this. Known family history of AAA makes this already high-risk patient even more so  underscoring the importance of regular follow-up and health maintenance measures.
10,9,56,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial56,"Patient Profile: The patient is a Caucasian male  aged 72 years  living in Newark  New Jersey. He is a retired mechanical engineer and lives with his wife. He is a former smoker  with a 20-pack year history  but quit about 15 years ago. He has a history of hypertension for which he has been on medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily)  and was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 10 years back. He drinks moderately. He does not have a history of substance abuse. He also reports an irregular diet  sometimes missing meals due to loss of appetite.   Family medical history: The patient’s father died from coronary artery disease at the age of 60  and his mother passed away due to complications from diabetes at the age of 72. There is no known history of aortic aneurysm in his family.   Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the emergency room with complaints of abdominal and back pain  which he describes as a constant  intense pulsating sensation  located in the middle of his abdomen and radiating to his lower back. The patient rated the pain as an 8 on a scale of 10.  Medical Examination: Physical examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the patient’s abdomen. This  along with the history of hypertension  pointed towards a preliminary diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Investigations: A subsequent CT scan affirmed the diagnosis  revealing an AAA measuring 7.5 cm in diameter. This crucial size  combined with the patient's presenting symptoms  places the patient at a high risk for rupture - a life-threatening condition.  Management: The attending vascular surgeon recommended an urgent endovascular aortic aneurysm repair surgery  considering the size of the aneurysm and the patient's high rupture risk.   Post-Operative Care: Patient will be closely monitored in the hospital until stabilized  followed by regular follow-ups with the doctor for monitoring vital signs  possible complications  and the efficacy of the current treatment plan.  Conclusion: This case highlights the critical importance of early detection and intervention in a patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm. Primary care providers should be aware of the importance of palpating the abdomen as part of routine physical examination for older male patients  especially those with a history of smoking and hypertension. Timely diagnosis and intervention can prevent the potentially fatal consequence of a ruptured aneurysm.   References: It is important to continually update professional knowledge regarding AAA  given the serious implications of this condition. The """"2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients with Valvular Heart Disease"""" provides detailed information on the management of this condition and is recommended as further reading."
10,9,57,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial57,Patient Case Presentation Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 75-year-old male  Caucasian  retired from the military and living with his wife. He is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol. The patient has a family history of both hypertension and cardiovascular disease. His father died at the age of 68 from a heart attack while his mother passed away at the age of 72 due to stroke.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented to the clinic with a three-week history of generalized abdominal pain that is not associated with food intake. The pain is non-radiating  dull in nature  continuous  and graded as 5/10 in terms of intensity. No other gastrointestinal symptoms reported  like vomiting  altered bowel habits  or weight loss.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension for the past 20 years  for which he is under medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily). He also reported a past history of elevated cholesterol levels and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but is not on home oxygen. He has not been previously diagnosed or treated for diabetes.  Physical Exam:  Upon examination  the patient appeared in mild distress due to pain. Vital signs were stable  except for an elevated blood pressure reading of 160/90 mmHg. On abdominal palpation  there was a pulsatile mass in the midline around the umbilicus.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  The patient underwent ultrasonography  which revealed a 5.6cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm. A subsequent CT angiogram also confirmed the infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm  consistent with the presented symptoms and physical exam. No rupture or leakage was evidenced.  Management Plan:  Given the size of the aneurysm and the risk of rupture  the patient was referred to Vascular Surgery for possible endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). Meanwhile  the patient's hypertension was escalated with an added medication (Amlodipine 5mg/daily).  Discussion:  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) tends to be asymptomatic until it becomes large or ruptures. Risk factors include age >65  male gender  smoking  and a family history of AAA. Hypertension can be a risk factor as well. It's crucial to diagnose AAA early to prevent potential rupture and consequent high mortality. Management typically includes surgical intervention  alongside optimal control of associated cardiovascular risk factors. This patient's case is a classic example of the importance of early detection and multi-disciplinary involvement in management.
10,9,58,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial58,Patient Brief Case Presentation:   Patient details: Our patient Mr. John Doe is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  who presented with complaints of a dull  constant pain localizing in his lower back and abdominal regions. He is a retired civil engineer and lives with his wife in the city. He stated that the pain had been intermittently present over the last month but had been increasing in frequency and intensity over the past week.   Past medical history: Mr. Doe has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a 25-year history of cigarette smoking  but he quit smoking five years ago. Also  he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 15 years ago  for which he is currently on metformin. No past surgical history was reported by the patient.  Family history:  Mr. Doe's father died of a stroke at the age of 75  while his mother lived up to the age of 80 without any significant medical issues. His older brother  aged 77  was recently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm as well.   Findings: This prompted suspicion of the potential for a vascular disease  particularly an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). This suspicion increased due to Mr. Doe's age  sex  history of hypertension  and smoking. He underwent an abdominal ultrasound which confirmed the presence of an AAA measuring around 4.6cm in diameter.  Treatment Plan: The multidisciplinary team will pursue close observation and management of risk factors  considering the AAA size. This will include continuous hypertension  cholesterol  and diabetes control. Mr. Doe is also advised to attend follow-up visits every 6 months to monitor the aneurysm  as rapid enlargement or symptoms may suggest the need for surgical intervention.  The case of Mr. Doe emphasizes the importance of considering AAA in the differential for non-specific abdominal or back pain  particularly in those patients with risk factors such as age over 65 years  male gender  history of smoking  and hypertension. Furthermore  it underscores the significance of familial tendency in the development of AAAs and the utility of ultrasonography in initial diagnosis and follow-up assessment.
10,9,59,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial59,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male named Jim  who resides in New York City. He is a retired construction worker and leads an overall sedentary lifestyle due to occasional joint pain. He has been a heavy smoker for the last 45 years and moderately consumes alcohol.  Medical History:  Jim has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  for which he takes medication. He had been experiencing intermittent and vague abdominal pain for over a week  which was initially attributed to indigestion and managed with over-the-counter antacids. Three days ago  the abdominal discomfort became acute  initially functioning as a pulsating lower back pain  ultimately driving Jim to the emergency department.   In the past  Jim underwent an angioplasty at the age of sixty for coronary artery disease. Echocardiogram reports have shown a mildly reduced ejection fraction. His chart also shows a diagnosis of Stage-2 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)  for which he undergoes routine blood work. He has been treated twice for pneumonia over the past six years.  Family History:  Jim's family history reveals that his father died due to a rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 68. His mother lived until 91 and passed away from a stroke. He has two older brothers; one is healthy  and the other diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable that directed clinical suspicion towards AAA. His blood pressure was 165/90  and heart rate was 88 bpm. Laboratory examinations of Jim showed slightly elevated creatinine  suggestive of his underlying CKD and marginally raised troponin levels. His complete blood count  coagulation profile  and electrolyte levels were all within normal limits. Further  a contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.5 cm.  Diagnosis and Management:  Given the size of the AAA  Jim's history of smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol  and family history of AAA  the risk of rupture is high. After discussions involving vascular surgery  interventional radiology  and the patient  a decision was made for an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).  In conclusion  this case highlights the importance of considering AAA in the differential diagnosis in elderly patients presenting with unexplained and persistent abdominal or back pain  especially in the presence of risk factors such as hypertension  high cholesterol  smoking  and family history. Timely diagnosis and intervention are crucial to prevent fatal complications such as rupture.
10,9,60,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial60,Patient Information:  Joseph Brown  a 68-year-old Caucasian male originally from Texas  has been confirmed with a diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm(AAA).  Medical History:   Mr. Brown is a retired accountant now living in Denver  Colorado. He has a past medical history including hypertension for the last 15 years; for which he has been on medication. He was diagnosed with Type-II diabetes approximately 10 years back and has been controlling it with a combination of medications and dietary changes. He also had a stroke three years ago but fully recovered without any significant neurologic deficit. His other past medical history includes occasional GERD and hyperlipidemia.  Family History:   Mr. Brown has a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 72 and his elder brother had been diagnosed with AAA at 70 years. There is also a family history of type-II diabetes including his only sister and nephew.  Social History:   Mr. Brown is a widower  living with his elder daughter and two grandchildren. He quit smoking after his stroke three years back and has been maintaining an active lifestyle ever since. He drinks alcohol only socially and moderately.   Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Brown came with complaints of moderate to severe persistent abdominal pain that occasionally radiates to his lower back. The pain has been growing worse over the last month. He also notes occasional nausea and feeling of fullness even after small meals. He has lost about 10 pounds unexpectedly in the last three months without making any major dietary changes.  Investigations and Findings:  On clinical examination  a pulsatile mass could be palpated in his abdomen with auscultation revealing a bruit. Hence  Abdominal Ultrasonography was done which confirmed the presence of an AAA  with a maximal diameter of 5.5 cm.  Case Discussion:  Mr. Brown's AAA is an incidental finding following his complaints of persistent abdominal and back pain. Although AAAs are often asymptomatic until rupture  abdominal and back pain have been found to precede AAA rupture. Considering his significant family history of AAA and cardiovascular diseases; and also his past medical history  especially of hypertension  there is a risk factor predisposing Mr. Brown to AAA. His AAA is now approaching the size (5.5cm) at which prophylactic surgery is considered; to avoid the risk of rupture.  Plan:  The patient should have a detailed discussion with vascular surgery about the benefits and risks of both endovascular stent grafting and open surgery repair. His blood pressure control should be optimized. The GP should be informed  and a referral to a dietician for better diabetic control through diet may be helpful. His family members may also benefit from screening  considering the hereditary predisposition to AAA.
10,9,61,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial61,"Case Presentation  Patient Information:  Mr. X is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a height of 5'10"""" and weight of 185 lbs  retired automotive worker  who lives independently at home with his wife. He was brought to the hospital by his son due to complaints of a sudden  severe and persistent pain in his lower back and abdominal region  which started a couple of days ago.  Medical History:  The patient is known to have an extensive medical history with hypertension as well as hyperlipidemia  for which he has been on Amlodipine and Simvastatin respectively for the past 16 years. He is also a reformed smoker  consuming one pack daily for 30 years  but finally managed to quit smoking almost eight years back. He does not have any known allergies. His vaccination history is up-to-date  and his immunization includes an influenza shot annually and pneumococcal vaccine every five years.   Family History: A history of cardiovascular diseases is evident in his family. His father had a myocardial infarction at 65 and passed away due to stroke at 70. His mother died of heart failure at 75. He has one elder brother who is diabetic and a younger sister who is healthy.  Examination and Lab Investigations: The patient appeared uncomfortable. His blood pressure was 170/90 mmHg  with a pulse of 85 bpm  regular. His respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation 97% on room air and temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius. Physical examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the abdomen. Detailed lab tests showed slightly raised D-dimer and C-reactive protein indicating inflammation  normal kidney function tests  but raised cholesterol levels. Also  an abdominal Ultrasonography and CT scan findings confirmed the presence of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Diagnosis: Given the patient's clinical picture and diagnostic tests  a diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is made.  Treatment Plan: The aneurysm measures approximately 5.6cm in diameter  which represents a critical size in terms of rupture risk and has significant pain indicating instability. An immediate referral to vascular surgery for endovascular aortic repair was completed. Also  the patient’s current medications will be continued until further recommendation by the vascular surgeon.  Follow-up: The patient will be admitted under the surgical unit and monitored for postoperative recovery and progress. There will be routine follow-ups and clinical assessments to monitor for any complications after the surgery.  Conclusion: Despite Mr. X being a fairly fit individual for his age  with the controlled underlining condition  his previous smoking habit and the family history of cardiovascular disease lead to the development of AAA. Early diagnosis and intervention in Mr. X's case signifies the importance of regular monitoring in those with risk factors for AAA  even in the absence of symptoms  to prevent fatal complications."
10,9,62,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial62,Patient Presentation  Complete Demographics:   The patient is a 72-year-old Portuguese-American male  recently retired firefighter  residing in Charleston  South Carolina with his wife and two adult children. He presents as a non-smoker and a social-drinker.   Chief Complaint:   Patient reported experiencing persistent abdominal pain and lower back discomfort over the past few weeks. The pain occurs intermittently  typically after meals  and worsens upon physical exertion.  Relevant Past Medical History:   The patient has a history of hypertension for which he takes Lisinopril  and hyperlipidemia controlled with Atorvastatin. He underwent appendectomy at the age of 25 and has had recurrent urinary tract infections over the past decade.  Family History:   His father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 74. His older brother (75) has a diagnosed  but not yet surgically intervened  5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. His mother passed away at the age of 86 from natural causes. The patient has two adult sons  both in good health.  Medical Examination and Test Results:   Vitals: BP 150/90 mmHg  HR 77/min  respiratory rate 18/min  SpO2 96% on room air  BMI 30 kg/m^2.  Physical Exam: Poorly localized pain in the lower abdomen and back on palpation. No pulsating mass palpable in the abdomen. Normal bowel sounds heard.   Investigations: Abdominal ultrasound revealed a 5.5 cm fusiform aneurysm in the infra-renal segment of the aorta. No immediate signs of rupture were noted. Further analysis by CT scan confirmed the diagnosis and showed that the aneurysm is saccular with moderately thickened aortic wall.  Impression/Diagnosis:   The patient's age  gender  complaint of abdominal and back pain  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  family history  and ultrasound + CT results all support the diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Due to the size of the aneurysm (5.5cm)  the patient is at a high risk of rupture and requires immediate intervention.  Treatment and Management:  Given the size of the aneurysm and the risk of rupture  a timely open surgical repair (OSR) or endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) should be considered based on the thorough examination of the patient's overall health and surgical risks. The patient should also receive counselling on lifestyle changes such as improving diet and maintaining regular exercise to control hypertension and hyperlipidemia.   Prognosis:  Early identification and treatment significantly lower the risk of rupture  which carries a mortality rate of over 80%. With proper monitoring and recommended surgical intervention  the patient has a good chance of having a successful outcome.
10,9,63,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial63,Presentation:  The patient is a 74-year-old African American male who is recently diagnosed with a 5.4 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) detected by screening ultrasound taken due to the presence of risk factors.   Demographics: He is retired  nonsmoker  but used to smoke one pack per day for about 40 years until he quit 10 years ago. He enjoys moderate alcohol consumption and follows a low-cholesterol diet. Lives alone in an urban apartment. He is insured and has access to medical and surgical services.  Medical History: The patient has hypertension and Type-II diabetes and is taking antihypertensives and oral hypoglycemics. Has average glycemic control with a last HbA1c of 7.8  3 months ago. He had a myocardial infarction 5 years back and has been on low-dose aspirin since then. Cholesterol levels have been in the normal range with no history of strokes  claudication  or TIAs. Past surgical history includes a successful prostatectomy for BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) 10 years ago.  Family History: His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 67  mother lived up to 83 years with no major health issues. He has 2 siblings  one of them suffered from a ruptured AAA at the age of 72.   Current Condition: He remains asymptomatic with regards to the AAA  with only mild to moderate lower back pain occasionally  which he had attributed to his old age. He has average mobility and is able to perform activities of daily living independently.  Examination: On physical examination  he was found to be of average build with some evidence of peripheral vascular disease in the form of weak pedal pulses. Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile and expansile mass in the infrarenal region. No other significant findings were present.  Discussion: Since the AAA is larger than 5 cm with a high-risk family history  the usual course of action would be to consider surgical repair to prevent rupture. However  his previous cardiac event and chronic conditions like diabetes might make him a high-risk surgical candidate  hence a thorough pre-operative evaluation including cardiac stress testing would be advised. A detailed discussion about his potential risks and benefits must be carried out with the patient.  Based on this information  it is imperative to decide the appropriate course of action which should be individualized to the patient's unique medical and social situation.
10,9,64,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial64,Patient Presentation  Patient Information: Mr. Charles Hernandez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  presented in the clinic with a primary complaint of occasional discomfort and a dull  throbbing pain in the lower back and abdominal area.  Past Medical History: The patient has a recorded history of coronary artery disease  hypertension  and high cholesterol levels. He also sustained a minor stroke 5 years earlier but has made a successful recovery.  Current Medication: He is on aspirin  metoprolol  atorvastatin  and amlodipine for his heart condition and hypertension.  Family History: His father passed away due to an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 68  and his mother died of complications related to diabetes in her mid-70s. He has a brother diagnosed with angina.  Social History: The patient quit smoking ten years ago after a 30-year history of smoking. He drinks alcohol occasionally but has no history of illicit drug use. He is retired but stays physically active on a daily basis  performing light exercises and walking.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  Mr. Hernandez's blood pressure was slightly elevated  and a pulsating mass was palpable in the mid-abdominal region. A bruit was detected over the mass on auscultation.   Diagnostic Assessment: He was immediately subjected to an ultrasound scan  which revealed an enlarged abdominal aorta with a diameter of 5.5 cm  suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). An ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with no signs of ischemic changes.  Management: Emergency referral was made to Vascular Surgery following the initial diagnosis and assessment. The clinical decision was to perform an elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) to prevent rupture of the aneurysm. Additionally  prescribed medications for his heart condition and hypertension were reviewed and adjusted to optimize his blood pressure and overall cardiovascular health before the operation.  Discussion: The AAA in patients like Mr. Hernandez can be asymptomatic and only detected via physical examination or incidentally during diagnostic imaging for other conditions. However  once it expands beyond 5 cm  the risk of rupture increases significantly  necessitating immediate surgical intervention. The prognosis after EVAR surgery is generally good with continued follow-up.    Future Consideration: The presence of AAA in Mr. Hernandez also warrants careful monitoring of close relatives considering the higher risk in first-degree relatives of patients with AAA.
10,9,65,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial65,Patient's Overview: This case involves Mr. A  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  with a recent diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He was referred to the clinic due to a discovery made during a routine abdominal ultrasound undertaken for unrelated renal issues. He is a retired engineer and lives with his wife. Their two daughters live nearby.  Medical History: Mr. A has an extensive medical history including controlled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Notably  he is a former smoker  having smoked a pack a day for approximately 30 years  but quit smoking 10 years ago. He admits to occasional alcohol consumption but denies any illicit drug use. Despite these current controlled conditions  he remains relatively mobile  performing daily tasks independently  with mild dyspnea upon exertion due to COPD.   Presenting Problem: He presents with asymptomatic AAA identified through ultrasound  which he underwent due to a history of nephrolithiasis. No abdominal pain  back pain  or recent changes in bowel or urinary habits noticed  which are cardinal symptoms of ruptured/symptomatic AAA.  Family History:  There is a concerning family history  as his father died suddenly due to (presumed) ruptured AAA at the age of 75. Moreover  his elder brother underwent successful elective surgical repair for AAA at the age of 73. No known history of connective tissue disorders in the family.  Examination/Diagnosis: A physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass. Subsequent ultrasonography of the abdomen confirmed the presence of an AAA with a maximum diameter of 5.3 cm. No other visceral anomalies were detected. EKG showed no abnormalities.   Treatment Plan: As per the current guidelines  since the aneurysm is larger than 5.5 cm  the patient was informed about the need for surgical intervention to prevent the risk of rupture. After discussing the pros and cons  the patient consented for elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A detailed surgical planning CT with contrast was arranged. His medications  including antihypertensives and oral antidiabetic agents  were reviewed and optimized.  Conclusion: This patient’s case portrays the significance of routine health checks and gives emphasis to the value of a detailed patient and family history. For patients such as Mr. A with established risk factors for AAA  including older age  male gender  smoking history  hypertension  and family history of AAA  early detection and appropriate management is key to preventing fatal complications.   Note: In real-world practice  precise information regarding the patient's demographics  medical history  presenting symptoms  initial diagnosis  laboratory results  treatment and outcomes will be included in a case presentation. 
10,9,66,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial66,Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Profile:   Mr. John Masters  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  lives in the suburbs of New Jersey  with his wife and is a retired engineer. He has been experiencing persistent abdominal pain and back discomfort for several weeks  which led him to seek medical advice.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Masters has a lengthy medical history that includes well-managed hypertension for the past 10 years  hyperlipidemia  and COPD due to 40 years of smoking. He has two former myocardial infarctions  the most recent one was five years ago. For these conditions  he routinely takes tab lisinopril  tab atorvastatin  tab metoprolol  and inhalational salbutamol. He quit smoking after his second MI.  Family History:  There's a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases: both his father and older brother died of heart attacks in their early 70s. His mother had stroke at the age of 80 and died at 84. Additionally  his maternal grandfather had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Presenting Complaints:  His main complaints are dull ache in his abdomen and lower back pain. The pain isn't associated with meals  posture  or physical activity. He reported unintentional weight loss but no fever  chills  or changes in bowel movements.  Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was felt. The patient also displayed mild hypertension with a blood pressure of 150/95 mmHg.  Investigations:  Labs were largely unremarkable with normal renal function  CBC  liver function and electrolytes. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed a 5.5cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm.  Diagnosis:  Given the clinical examination and ultrasound findings  Mr. Masters was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Plan:  Elective surgical repair of his AAA is suggested due to its size and risk for rupture. Mr. Masters will need a pre-operative evaluation to ascertain his fitness for surgery. His hypertension should also be managed more aggressively. A cessation of smoking was previously achieved  a low fat diet to manage his hyperlipidemia and continue his medications has been recommended. Alongside medical treatment  the benefit of repair (open or endovascular) should be discussed and considered. Regular follow-ups for his other chronic conditions are needed.  Informed consent regarding the benefits  risks  and alternatives to surgery will be taken. Family support and engagement during this time would play a vital role in the management of Mr. Masters' condition. His case should be managed with a multidisciplinary approach involving the cardiologist  surgeon  anesthetist  and nursing staff.
10,9,67,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial67,Patient Profile: The patient is a 70-year-old male  Mr. J  Caucasian  retired military officer  living with his wife in the suburbs of New York. He is a non-smoker and maintains a moderate alcohol consumption. His BMI is 28  indicating overweight.  Presenting Complaints & Clinical Findings: Mr. J complained of severe lower back pain and abdominal discomfort persisting for the last two weeks. He had an occasional drop in blood pressure. He also mentioned feeling a pulsating sensation near his navel. The pain has not subsided despite initial treatments for low back pain.  Past Medical History: Reviewing his medical history  it reveals that Mr. J is diagnosed with hypertension for the past 15 years  controlled by medication. He also has borderline hyperlipidemia and had peripheral vascular disease about 10 years ago. He is not diabetic  but he has a history of heart disease and had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery approximately 6 years back.  Family History: Mr. J reported that his father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at the age of 75.  Investigations & Diagnosis: Given his symptoms and family history  the physician ordered an abdominal ultrasound. This revealed a 5.5 cm aneurysm in his abdominal aorta. Based on the screening results and clinical presentation  a diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm was made.  Treatment & Follow-Up: Considering his age  size of aneurysm  and medical history  the multi-disciplinary team recommended surgical intervention—an elective Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR). He is currently under preoperative assessments to minimize the anesthetic risk. Simultaneously  he is counselled about the possible risk and benefits associated with the procedure. His blood pressure is being closely monitored with adjustments in medications as required. He will be followed up postoperatively in the vascular clinic every 6 months with ultrasound for surveillance of his EVAR.  This case highlights the importance of considering a diagnosis of AAA in older patients presenting with unexplained  persistent back or abdominal pain  especially with a family history of AAA or significant risk factors. Prompt diagnosis and timely intervention can prevent catastrophic outcomes like aortic rupture.
10,9,68,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial68,Case Presentation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Information Patient AB  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presented with abrupt onset of severe lower back pain radiating to both lower extremities. He is a current smoker with a history of 30 pack-years and notable physical findings include a body mass index (BMI) of 29.8 kg/m(2)  a large pulsatile abdominal mass  and normal peripheral artery pulses.   Prior Medical History AB's past medical history includes hypertension  dyslipidemia  and peripheral artery disease. He is being managed on Lisinopril 20mg daily for his hypertension  Atorvastatin 20mg daily for his dyslipidemia  and Aspirin 81mg daily for his peripheral artery disease. His last check-up was six months ago and he has reported good compliance to his medications. Despite persistent advice  he has continued to smoke.  Family History The patient revealed his father died at the age of 65 due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). There is no history of AAA on the maternal side of the family. However  his mother died of a heart attack at the age of 75 and his brother  aged 70  is currently being treated with antihypertensive drugs for high blood pressure.   Current Presentation Following assessment  an urgent Computed Tomographic Angiogram (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis of AAA measuring 7.8 cm with the possibility of rupture. Due to increasing back pain and risk of AAA rupture  he was recommended for urgent surgical intervention. The patient has been advised to stop smoking  maintain a healthy diet  and keep up with drug treatment to control blood pressure and lipid levels.   Given his age  smoking history  and notable family history of AAA  the patient was at a high risk for developing AAA. Although the patient acknowledges the severity of his condition  he remains adamant on maintaining his current lifestyle habits and is doubtful about the proposed surgical intervention. Emphasis on the risks of his lifestyle choices and the projected positive outcomes of the prescribed surgical treatment is our ongoing challenge with patient AB.
10,9,69,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial69,Patient Information: The patient is Mr. Thomas  a 68-year-old Caucasian male who is retired. He lives with his spouse and maintains a fairly sedentary lifestyle since retirement. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago  after a 30-year pack-a-day habit. His body mass index (BMI) is 27.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thomas has a past medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He has not had any previous surgeries or significant illnesses. Up to this point  Mr. Thomas has been managing his medical conditions with medication and regular check-ups. His medications include Lisinopril 10mg once daily and Atorvastatin 40mg once at night.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented with intermittent abdominal pain and lower back discomfort. The pain is described as sudden  severe  and constant  mostly in the abdominal area  radiating to the lower back. It lasts for several hours and isn't relieved by changes in position or other symptomatic measures.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  On examination  the clinician palpated a pulsatile abdominal mass  raising the suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). An ultrasound confirmed the presence of a large abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6.5cm in diameter. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate were noted to be elevated during the episodes of pain; however  no other signs or symptoms of shock were present.  Family History:  Mr. Thomas's father died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture at the age of 70. His mother died of breast cancer at 65. He has one brother who also has an AAA diagnosis.  Management:  Due to the size of the aneurysm and family history  the decision was made to proceed with surgical intervention. The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for an endovascular repair (EVAR). He will also undergo a cardio-pulmonary assessment given the risk factors and the nature of the surgery.  Discussion: Mr. Thomas is at higher risk of having an AAA given his gender (male)  age  history of smoking  and the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore  his positive family history and his age push the risk even further. His current symptoms of abdominal pain and the size of the aneurysm suggest an imminent risk of rupture  necessitating instruction for surgical evaluation. After surgery  Mr. Thomas needs to be monitored long-term with regular imaging surveillance to ascertain the stability of the aneurysm repair. 
10,9,70,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial70,Patient Introduction: Mr. James Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with a complaint of sudden severe abdominal and back pain  which he described to be ripping and tearing in nature. Mr. Smith is a retired machine operator and lives with his wife in a suburban community.   Relevant Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension which is managed by lisinopril (5mg daily). He also has a distant smoking history of 20 years but quit about 25 years ago. He also has hyperlipidemia. Mr. Smith reported regular checkups with his primary care physician and allegedly was in stable condition until the development of the current symptoms.  Family History: The patient’s father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 62 and his mother died of stroke at 70. Mr. Smith has one brother who is 62 and has recently been diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). There's no known family history of connective tissue disorders.  Physical Examination: Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 185/101 mm Hg and pulse rate of 91 beats/minute. On examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable. Lab results showed anemia and elevated inflammatory markers. Electrocardiogram was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Evaluation: An emergent CT scan was performed  confirming the presence of a 7.4 cm AAA with evidence of rupture. The patient was immediately referred to vascular surgery for further management.  Management and Outcome: Mr. Smith underwent an emergent open surgical repair (aortic grafting). Postoperative recovery was complicated by an acute kidney injury related to perioperative hypotension. However  with aggressive management  his renal function returned to baseline  and he was discharged home on postoperative day 8.  Discussion: In Mr. Smith's case  risk factors for AAA include his age  gender  history of hypertension  former smoker  as well as his brother’s diagnosis of AAA (which can indicate a possible genetic predisposition). Prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention are crucial in the management of a ruptured AAA to avoid potentially fatal outcomes.   Healthcare providers must maintain a high index of suspicion for AAA in patients presenting with acute onset of abdominal or back pain  particularly in those with risk factors. A routine screening program could be beneficial for high-risk individuals considering the silent nature of the disease. Regular follow-ups with primary care physicians  and management of risk factors  are essential preventive strategies for these patients.
10,9,71,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial71,Patient Profile:   Mr. John S.  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  retired  with a BMI of 28  was referred by his family physician for further evaluation after detection of a pulsatile abdominal mass.  Patient’s Past Medical History:  Patient has a past medical history of high blood cholesterol  hypertension  and smoking for 40 years before quitting two years ago. He had an episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) around a year ago  with no recurrence. No history of diabetes. Patient is currently on statin therapy for hypercholesterolemia and antihypertensive drugs.   Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. S. came into the clinic with symptoms of occasional vague abdominal discomfort and back pain. He denies any recent weight loss or loss of appetite. He reported having some difficulty in passing stools  thought to be constipation. No history of abdominal surgeries or traumas.  Family History:  His father passed away from a heart attack at age 75  and his mother died from a stroke at ages 82. He has a brother who had an operation for abdominal aortic aneurysm at age 70. There is no history of aneurysms  strokes  or diabetes in any of his four children  all above 30 years.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass. His blood pressure was measured to be 145/90. No signs of peripheral vascular disease were noted. His blood cholesterol level was found to be slightly elevated despite statin therapy.  Diagnosis:  Upon suspicion  a transabdominal ultrasound was performed which confirmed the presence of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring approximately 5 cm in the largest diameter. A subsequent contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed an incidental unruptured atheromatous aneurysm in the abdominal region.  Treatment Plan:  Given Mr. S.'s age  smoking history  the size of his aneurysm  and family history of aortic aneurysm  surgical intervention is planned. The patient will undergo the endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) procedure. His blood pressure and cholesterol levels will continue being managed medically. He receives information about risks and benefits concerning the procedure and gives his informed consent.  Outcome & Follow-up:  Follow-up will include regular physical check-ups and imaging surveillance post-EVAR every six months for the first two years  then annually thereafter  to ensure there are no complications or recurrence.   In conclusion  Mr. S.'s case highlights the importance of family history in the early detection and management of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
10,9,72,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial72,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Rodriguez  a 71-year-old Hispanic male  presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal and lower back pain that had been worsening over a period of four hours. He described the pain as a tearing sensation radiating to his back. He also complained of nausea and shortness of breath. His vitals on admission were blood pressure: 140/90mmHg and a heart rate of 100 beats per minute.   Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 50 pack-year smoking history. He has been on Amlodipine and Lipitor for the last 15 years. He underwent an appendectomy in his twenties and was in good health until a diagnosis of hypertension at the age of 50. There is a negative history of alcohol or drug abuse. He is allergic to penicillin  which causes a rash.  Family History:  Mr. Rodriguez's family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases. Both his parents died of heart disease in their late sixties. His two older brothers have coronary artery disease  and one of them also has an abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is no known family history of connective tissue disorders or polycystic kidney disease.  Clinical Findings:  Clinical examination showed a pulsatile mass in the abdomen. The patient looked uncomfortable. There were no signs of peritonitis. A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 8cm  which was severely infrarenal and was threatening to rupture.   Impression and Plan:  Considering the patient's age  medical history  family history  and most importantly his present clinical picture  the diagnosis of a rupturing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was made. The increased size of the aneurysm  combined with his symptoms  suggested imminent rupture  which elevated the patient to surgical emergency.   The vascular surgery team was immediately consulted and the patient was prepared for an emergent open surgical repair  given his stable hemodynamic condition. He was counsellued about the urgency and risks of the procedure and provided informed consent. Post-operation  the patient will be closely monitored in ICU for any signs of complications  such as renal failure  bowel ischemia  and lower limb ischemia. After discharge  surveillance will be initiated for the monitoring of other potential aneurysms  given the family history. The patient will also be advised on lifestyle modifications  such as quitting smoking  along with the continuation of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia management.  This case underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis and intervention in elderly patients with a significant smoking history and family history of aneurysms  who present with symptoms suggestive of a rupturing AAA. 
10,9,73,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial73,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 68 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer Marital Status: Married  Presenting Problem: Mr. Doe was referred to the vascular surgery clinic for evaluation of an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm  as reported by his primary care physician.  Medical History: Mr. Doe is a long-standing patient with a history of hypertension  smoking (30 pack/year)  peripheral artery disease  and hypercholesterolemia. He had a myocardial infarction twenty years ago  treated with a single bypass graft.  Present Condition: At the time of presentation  Mr. Doe reported feeling occasional  mild abdominal discomfort but no severe pain  back pain  tenderness  or other consistent symptoms associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm.   Physical Examination:  On physical examination  he had a palpable  pulsating mass in the mid- and upper abdomen.  Investigative Results:  An abdominal ultrasound revealed a 5.4 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. No evidence of rupture or leaking was found.  Family History:  Mr. Doe’s father passed away at 70 due to a myocardial infarction. His mother deceased at 90 with no cardiovascular problems. He has two brothers; one diagnosed with coronary artery disease in his 60s.  Social History:  Mr. Doe is married with two grown-up children. He used to smoke 1 pack/day for 30 years and quit about ten years ago. He denies any alcohol or recreational drug use.  Treatment Plan:  Given the aneurysm's size and the patient's risk factors  the team recommended surgical intervention  in particular  endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The associated risks  potential benefits  and alternatives were extensively discussed with the patient and his family. They agreed with the proposed plan.  Prognosis: The prognosis for Mr. Doe following surgery is generally good  considering his past medical condition. However  regular monitoring to check aneurysm growth and leaks is recommended. He has agreed to participate in a smoking cessation program  which will substantially decrease his future peripheral and cardiovascular risks.   This case presentation illustrates the importance of early detection  evaluation  and timely intervention in managing abdominal aortic aneurysms effectively. It also emphasizes the importance of addressing lifestyle factors like smoking  known to potentiate aortic aneurysm progression.
10,9,74,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial74,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: A 72-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Emergency Department complaining of extreme pain localized in the lower back and abdominal area. He described the pain as a dull and deep-seated ache. The pain was sudden in onset and had been persistent for over an hour intermittently. His vital signs showed elevated blood pressure at 168/100 mmHg  heart rate of 88 bpm  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation 97% on room air  and temperature was 98.2°F. He had no known allergies at the time of presentation.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past ten years  managed with lisinopril and atorvastatin. The patient has a 30 pack-year history of smoking but quit smoking about ten years ago. He also has a history of obesity  with a BMI of 31. No history of any surgical intervention was reported.  Family History: His father died at 78 due to coronary artery disease  and his younger brother suffered a stroke at 60. Apart from cardiovascular complications  neither the immediate family members nor the extended family showed a history of diseases like cancers or infectious diseases.   Present Illness: Physical examination revealed a pulsating abdominal mass. However  no bruits were heard over the mass. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable. Due to the nature of his symptoms and findings upon examination  an urgent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan was ordered  which showed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 7.5cm in diameter.   Investigation reports and findings: His blood panel showed borderline elevated LDL cholesterol levels  suggesting a moderately high cardiovascular risk. Normal kidney functions indicated no evidence of renal artery involvement. D-dimer level was slightly elevated  which typically happens with AAA. However  EKG  hematologic  and metabolic panels were normal.   Treatment and Prognosis: The patient was emergently prescribed iv morphine for pain management. Since he was hemodynamically stable  he was scheduled for an urgent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) over open surgical repair because of his age and hypertension.   The case was discussed with vascular surgery  and consent was taken for intervention. Patient was put on diltiazem to control his hypertension. His recovering prognosis post-surgery will need to be closely monitored considering his past medical history and large size aneurysm.   Summary: This case represents a classic presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in a patient with significant risk factors  including advanced age  male gender  history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a smoking history. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are key in preventing serious complications such as rupture and death. This case also underlines the importance of adopting a healthy lifestyle and regular screening in patients having multiple risk factors  for preventing aortic aneurysms.

It is more common in males and risk increases with a family history of AAA  old age  smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and other vascular diseases.
10,9,76,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial76,Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian male from New York City  was referred for consultation and further evaluation after an incidental finding of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) during an ultrasound scan for an unrelated matter.   His demographics include retirement from a professional job  high socio-economic status  non-smoker  non-vegan  ethyl alcohol consumer twice in a week. He lives with his wife  does regular self-care  and participates in moderate physical activities. He is not under any form of caregiver support.   The patient’s past medical history reveals hypertension controlled with medication (lisinopril 20mg daily)  dyslipidemia managed with statins (rosuvastatin 20mg daily)  and Type II diabetes mellitus under control with metformin (500mg twice daily). He denies any known allergies to food  chemicals  or medicine. He has a surgical history of an uncomplicated appendectomy which occurred 15 years ago.  Further  the patient demonstrated a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  with both his father and younger brother dying of myocardial infarction in their mid 70s. His mother died of stroke at the age of 78.   He denies having any complaints of pain  discomfort in his abdomen or lower back  or any episodes of fainting. He maintains regular bowel and urinary habits without any disturbances. He has not reported any loss of weight  loss of appetite  or fever. His vital signs are within normal limits  although blood pressure on his recent visits has been around 145/95 mmHg.   The patient's radiology report showed an AAA of approximately 4.6cm in diameter. The aneurysm located just above the aortic bifurcation with no significant increase in size over the last 3 months as per the comparison with previous images. No signs of rupture or impending rupture such as inflammation or hematoma were noted.   Inspecting the lipid panel  he demonstrated slightly elevated levels of total cholesterol and LDL with controlled triglycerides and HDL levels. His blood glucose level and HbA1c level were also under control  showing efficient management of his diabetes.  Moving forward  controlling his hypertension and maintaining regular follow-ups seem to be an immediate need. Given his familial history and lifestyle  he is at a high risk of AAA rupture. Therefore  an intervention plan should be proposed based on the threat-to-life and the potential benefits and consequences of the procedure. Constant monitoring of the AAA coupled with lifestyle changes will also be of primary importance in his case.

10,9,79,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial79,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the clinic with a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and back pain that started half an hour ago. He rated the pain as a sharp  9/10 pain that spread from his mid-abdomen to his lower back. He described a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 30 pack-year smoking history  which he quit ten years ago. He is currently on Atorvastatin for cholesterol and Losartan for his blood pressure. Mr. Smith has no known allergies.   He denied chest pain  shortness of breath  or any other symptoms. He has never had a similar episode in the past. Family history revealed that his father died in his 60s from an aortic aneurysm. His siblings have a history of cardiovascular disease  particularly hypertension.  Possibly Relevant Results:  On examination  the patient appeared uncomfortable and diaphoretic. His blood pressure was 168/98 mm Hg  heart rate was 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute  temperature was 37.2°C  and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Abdominal examination showed a pulsatile mass around the navel  tenderness precisely over the mass  but no signs of peritonitis.  After initial clinical assessment  an immediate abdominal ultrasound was performed. The ultrasound demonstrated a large  7 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with signs of a possible rupture. The patient was immediately transferred to the emergency department for further evaluation and management.  The patient condition was explained to him  including the risks of rupture  probable complications  need for emergent surgical intervention  and prognosis. The patient agreed and provided informed consent for emergency surgery.  Impression:  The patient was diagnosed with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm  which is a serious  life-threatening condition. Considering his age  history of smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and positive family history  he was at a high risk for developing AAA. Despite controlling his hypertension and cholesterol levels in recent years  the patient couldn’t escape his genetic predisposition.  Plan:  Mr. Smith was transferred to the operating room for an emergency repair of his ruptured AAA. The procedure was successful  and Mr. Smith was moved to the intensive care unit for close monitoring postoperatively.  This case concludes that strict monitoring and aggressive control of risk factors  plus screening for AAA in high-risk patients (such as Mr. Smith) can be beneficial in early detection and better management outcomes.
10,9,80,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial80,Patient Information: Mr. John Baker  a 75-year-old African-American male was admitted to our hospital following complaints of persistent  severe abdominal and back pain. He is a retired teacher and lives with his wife in the city. He is a non-smoker and drinks wine socially.   Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels and has been on antihypertensive and statin therapy for the past ten years. Mr. Baker has managed the hypertension well  with regular follow-ups and medication adjustments as needed. He has not had any other major illnesses or surgeries in the past. No history of allergies to any medication was reported.  Family History: Upon questioning  he disclosed a family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father had an aortic aneurysm (the aneurysm ruptured) and died at the age of 70. He has two brothers  one of whom has hypertension and the other passed away due to myocardial infarction.  Presenting Complaints: He first experienced sudden severe pain near the navel a week ago  lasting for more than a few hours  along with back pain. Over the week  the pain gradually spread to the groin and buttocks. No exacerbating or relieving factors were identified. There was no evidence of associated symptoms such as fever  syncope  or weight loss. Signs of shock or rupture were absent. His pulse rate and blood pressure were in the normal range.   Physical Examination: On examination  he was in no critical condition  conscious  and oriented. An abdominal palpation revealed a tender  pulsating mass in the central portion of his abdomen. The peripheral pulses were equal in all the limbs.   Investigations: Due to the family history and clinical presentation  an abdominal ultrasound was ordered  revealing a 5.1 cm dilation of the abdominal aorta. Computed Tomography scan of abdomen and pelvis confirmed the presence of an infra-renal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  confirming the suspicion.    Management and Outcome: Given his condition and the size of the aneurysm  operative intervention was warranted. Following interdisciplinary discussions  an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) procedure was performed due to its minimally invasive nature and the patient's preference. He tolerated the operation well with complete resolution of symptoms post-operatively.  The plan is to monitor his condition closely under cardiology and vascular surgery care  focusing on lifestyle counseling and regular medication for hypertension and hyperlipidemia control. He is also scheduled for six months' follow-up imaging tests to monitor the status of the aneurysm repair.  Teaching Points:  This case highlights the importance of detailed family histories when assessing cardiovascular risk  especially in patients with hypertensive and hyperlipidemia history. It also stresses early imaging and intervention in patients presenting with clinical suspicion of an aneurysm  given its potentially life-threatening complications if left undiagnosed or untreated. 
10,9,81,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial81,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith is a 67-year-old Caucasian male who is under observation for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He was diagnosed with the condition four weeks ago during a routine ultrasound scan  meant to monitor his chronic kidney disease stage 3.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension that has been controlled with medication for the past 15 years. He also has chronic kidney disease stage 3  which has been stable for the last couple of years. He ceased smoking 5 years ago but had a 35-year history of smoking one pack per day. He has moderate alcohol intake and follows a low-salt diet due to his kidney disease.  Current Medications:   Lisinopril for hypertension and Rosuvastatin for hyperlipidemia. Due to worsening of kidney function over time  dosage adjustments are periodically made.  Family history:  There is a significant family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father having died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 62 and his brother recently diagnosed with AAA too.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Smith is asymptomatic  without any abdominal or back pain. The AAA was found incidentally during an ultrasound scan for his chronic kidney disease monitoring.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  Mr. Smith appeared well. Vital signs were normal  and the abdominal examination was unremarkable with no palpable mass. His cardiovascular examination was normal without any significant peripheral vascular disease signs. The AAA was confirmed using a subsequent CT angiogram  which showed a 5.4 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm.  Treatment Plan:  Given the size of the aneurysm  the dangers of rupture are real. Therefore  an elective open repair surgery is planned. Mr. Smith has been informed about the risks and benefits of the procedure. He is scheduled to meet the anesthetist and the preoperative assessment team next week. He also knows the necessity of complying strictly with his antihypertensive medication to control his blood pressure before the surgery.  This case brings out an incidental finding of a large AAA in a patient with significant smoking and cardiovascular risk factors  which affirms the need to maintain a high index of suspicion in individuals with such risk predispositions. The timing and type of surgical intervention  open repair in this case  reflect the size of the aneurysm and the patient's overall health status.

Further  he states that he has been occasionally experiencing back pain that radiates to his groin  with increasing severity. He denies experiencing nausea  vomiting  past incidences of fractures  or bowel and bladder changes. His appetite and weight have remained consistent.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient’s blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg in the right arm  heart rate is 80 beats per minute  and his respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation level of 98% on room air. The abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the midline of the abdomen. Auscultation identified a bruit over the same area.  Investigations: The patient underwent a CT scan  which confirmed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 5.2cm in maximum diameter.  Diagnosis: The size of the disease and associated symptoms leads to the diagnosis of a symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Plan: Mr. A.J. is at a high risk for rupture due to the size of the aneurysm and his symptoms. Therefore  he will be referred for an imminent surgical intervention  either an open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)  based on a vascular surgeon's assessment.   Follow-Up: We need to emphasize the importance of regular follow-up post-surgery and lifestyle modifications  namely smoking cessation  diet modification  and appropriate exercise. Upon discharge  he will be required to take medications as prescribed and attend all follow-up appointments for monitoring and managing any potential complications.   The patient’s family members should also be informed about their increased risk of developing AAA  considering their familial relation to Mr. A.J.
10,9,88,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial88,Patient Presentation:   Mr. J  a 75-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 20-pack year history of smoking  is presented. He is currently residing in Chicago  Illinois  with his wife. He had been feeling relatively well until three days ago  when he started complaining of uncharacteristic abdominal and lower back pain.  History of present illness:   Mr. J came to the emergency department (ED) complaining of a sudden onset of severe abdominal and lower back pain that started three days ago. The pain was constant  rated 9/10  and did not alleviate with rest or over-the-counter pain medications. There was no nausea  vomiting  fever  urinary or bowel changes. He also reported a recent loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss over the past month.   Past medical history:   He was previously diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 15 years ago  and he has been on treatment with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. Patient is also an ex-smoker with a 20-pack year history who quit 10 years ago.   Family History:   His father passed away at 82 due to complications following a myocardial infarction  and his mother is alive and well at 101 with no significant health issues. His older brother died at 62 due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).  Physical examination:   On examination  the patient looked anxious but was alert and oriented. His blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg  pulse – 80 beats per minute  temperature of 36.7oC (98.1oF)  and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Abdominal exam revealed a pulsatile mass in the periumbilical area associated with tenderness.  Pertinent Tests and Results:   A confirmatory abdominal Ultrasound reveals a 6cm abdominal aorta aneurysm. His complete blood count was within normal limits  as were his liver function tests. His renal function was mildly impaired  with a creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl (normal < 1.3mg/dl).   Impression and Plan:  Given these findings  the patient was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm  likely related to his long history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking. Given the size of his aneurysm and associated symptoms  the patient was advised immediate surgical intervention to prevent rupture. We also discussed the need for better blood pressure control and the maintenance of a heart-healthy diet. The renal impairment might necessitate a lower Lisinopril dose; however  this will be reconsidered post-surgery. The patient was admitted to the surgery unit for monitoring and preparation for surgery.   Our plan is to repair the aneurysm endovascularly  followed by regular follow-ups for surveillance. Patient education and reassurance were also provided to Mr. J and his family. The risks associated with delayed intervention were explained carefully  and questions/concerns were addressed.
10,9,89,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial89,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian male was referred to our vascular clinic due to an incidental finding of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) during a computed tomography (CT) scan for a routine prostate cancer check. Mr. Doe is retired  lives with his wife and has two adult children. He is a former smoker  having quit a decade ago after a 30-year habit. He co-manages moderate hypertension and Type 2 diabetes with appropriate medication and lifestyle modifications. However  he admits difficulty adhering to a healthy diet and struggles with regular exercise due to age-associated mobility issues.  Doe's past medical history includes hypertension diagnosed 12 years ago  managed on angiotensin II receptor blockers and diuretics. His Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed 8 years ago  controlled by metformin and a bariatric diet. He underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) 5 years ago. He is also on a statin for hyperlipidemia. There is no history of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  carotid artery disease  stroke or renal failure. He underwent surgical repair for an inguinal hernia in the distant past.  His family history is significant for cardiac and vascular diseases. His father died of a myocardial infarction at 70 and his mother survived a stroke at 85. One of his brothers had an aortic aneurysm surgically repaired at 72.  Presenting complaint and investigations:   He was entirely asymptomatic regarding the AAA. CT scan revealed an infrarenal AAA measuring 5.5 cm in diameter. Further physical exam and investigations showed a well-healed midline sternotomy scar and a surgical scar in the lower-right quadrant. Cardiovascular examination was normal with no abnormal arterial pulses.   Impressions:  Considering the patient’s past and family history  long-term smoking history  and asymptomatic presentation  an incidental diagnosis of AAA was made. Current guidelines suggest surgical intervention for AAAs measuring greater than 5.5 cm or rapidly expanding aneurysms. This patient's AAA meets the criteria for surgical intervention.   Treatment plan and follow-up:   Given the size of the AAA and patient's previous history  he is promptly referred to vascular surgery for further evaluation and likely endovascular repair. Pre-operative cardiology clearance will be needed considering his prior CABG. Regular follow-up post-repair to monitor the success of the procedure as well as management of his diabetes and hypertension is planned. Lifestyle modifications to correct his diet and increase physical activity within the capabilities of his age and mobility are also emphasized.
10,9,90,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial90,Case Presentation   Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. S. He is a retired engineer  living with his wife in the suburbs.  Chief Complaint: Mr. S has been experiencing constant  severe lower back pain for the past two weeks.  History of Present Illness: Mr. S’s pain has been non-radiating and without any positional alleviation. It ranges from 7-8 on a scale of 10. He reports no recent history of injury  strains  or heavy lifting. In the last few days  he has also started feeling a pulsating sensation in his abdomen. Mr. S denies any changes in bowel or bladder function. He has occasional dizziness but denies any chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  or syncopal episodes.  Past Medical History: Mr. S has a history of hypertension and moderate hyperlipidemia. He was a smoker for about 50 years but quit 10 years ago. Mr. S also had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago  and as a result  he is on aspirin  metoprolol  and atorvastatin.  Family History: Mr. S’s father died of a stroke in his early 70s  and his mother died from complications of diabetes mellitus at 85. His only sibling  a brother who is 72  had a recent diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Physical Examination: Mr. S’s Abdominal examination revealed a pulsatile  expansile mass in the infraumbilical region which increased suspicion of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). His blood pressure on presentation was 160/90 mmHg. The rest of his systemic examination was unremarkable.    Diagnostic Assessment: Ultrasonography aorta revealed a saccular aneurysm in the infrarenal section of the abdominal aorta measuring 5.5 cm in maximal diameter. Enhanced CT Angiogram confirmed the above findings and ruled out any rupture or emergency situation. Lab investigations showed slightly elevated serum creatinine levels and normal Hb/HCT levels  indicating compensatory erythropoiesis. His lipid profile showed raised LDL levels.    Plan: Due to the size of the aneurysm and the patient's symptoms  surgical intervention is deemed appropriate. The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).  This case of Mr. S illustrates a typical case of large abdominal aortic aneurysm in a patient with relevant risk factors including advanced age  male gender  hypertension  a history of smoking  and family history of cardiovascular disease and AAA.

10,9,100,diagnosis10-prompt9-trial100,Patient Presentation: Our patient is a 75-year-old Caucasian male  a retired Navy officer  presenting with intermittent abdominal and back pain that has been persistent for a last few weeks. The pain  according to the patient  is not associated with meals and does not radiate to any specific location. He described it as a pulsating  sometimes sharp  abdominal pain  worse when he sits for extended periods.   Besides these  the patient does not have any other gastrointestinal or urinary complaints  weight loss  altered bowel habits or any alarming signs of anemia  jaundish or night-time awakening due to pain. He denies recent travels  and there is no history of trauma or injury.  Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago and has been on medication since. He also has moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for which he is on inhaler therapy. There is no history of any major surgical interventions apart from a hernia repair ten years ago. The patient admits to having smoked about 20 cigarettes daily for 50 years  and quit about two years back. He stopped alcohol consumption around the same time. He denies any other substance abuse.  Family History: His father had hypertension and suffered a stroke in his 70s. The patient’s mother had diabetes and was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of sixty. He has two brothers  both hypertensive. Both the patient's children are healthy with no significant health issues.  Assessment: On physical examination  the patient is conscious  alert and seems a bit anxious. His blood pressure is 142/90 mmHg and heart rate is 72 beats per minute. His BMI is 26. He has mild pitting edema in both ankles. On auscultation  lungs are clear. Abdominal examination reveals a pulsatile and tender mass in the periumbilical region.

He describes the pain as a dull ache in the lower back region that sometimes radiates to the sides. He says the pain is moderate in intensity and does not reduce with over-the-counter pain medications. Additionally  Mr. Brown mentions a weakness and feeling of heaviness in his legs.  He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or any alterations in bowel or urinary habits. He does not have a history of rectal bleeding or the presence of blood in urine. He also denies any recent traumatic events.  Given the age of the patient  his past medical history of hypertension  high cholesterol  diabetes  and tobacco use (although he did quit)  as well as his current chief complaints  it is essential to consider an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) as a differential diagnosis. An appropriate clinical evaluation and imaging studies should be arranged to confirm or rule out the condition.
10,10,2,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial2,Case Report:  Patient Profile: Gender: Male Age: 83  Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension - Patient has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past 15 years and is currently on antihypertensive medications. 2. Smoking History - Former smoker who quit 8 years ago after a history of smoking one pack a day for approximately 40 years. 3. Hyperlipidemia - Patient has been managing this condition with statins. 4. Family history of cardiovascular diseases - Father suffered from a myocardial infarction  brother died due to thoracic aortic aneurysm.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient came into the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of severe back pain that started a few hours ago. The patient describes it as a tearing sensation that radiates to the abdominal region. He also has been experiencing intermittent abdominal pain over the past few weeks. The patient reported minor weight loss and decreased appetite but no changes in bowel or urinary habits. He denied chest pain  shortness of breath  or lower extremity weakness.  These demographics  complaints  and medical history are important because they present common risk factors and symptoms for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The advanced age  male gender  hypertension  smoking history  hyperlipidemia  and family history of cardiovascular diseases serve as risk factors. The back pain radiating to the abdomen  the chronic nature of abdominal pain  and associated symptoms such as loss of appetite and weight loss are key symptoms often observed in patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This case provides an opportunity for medical students to learn about potential presentations  considerations  and procedures related to the diagnosis and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
10,10,3,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial3,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. Allen Thompson   Age: 70 years old   Sex: Male   Occupation: Retired engineer   Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian   Language: English   Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson is a retired engineer  who has never consumed alcohol or used illicit drugs but has a history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years which he quit about 10 years ago. He has a documented history of— 1. Hypertension  well-controlled on medication  2. Hyperlipidemia  3. Type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years  4. One episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) 5 years back.  Family History: His father died at 67 years due to a sudden  fatal rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His mother died due to old age with no significant health issues. He has one brother who was recently diagnosed with coronary artery disease.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Thompson presents to the clinic with recently evolving mild to moderate abdominal pain that he describes as dull and constant which increases after eating. He reports occasional lower back pain and having noticed a pulsating sensation in his abdomen  but initially dismissed as unrelated. No history of fever  cough  chest pain  or difficulty in breathing. He explains that he has unintentionally lost about 10 pounds over the last two months and his appetite has reduced significantly.  He reports history of irregular bowel movements for the last three weeks. No history of altered bowel habits  blood in stools  or black tar-like stools. No history of altered urination.   No history of recent trauma or surgical procedures. He has been feeling fatigued more than usual and didn’t think much of it until the abdominal discomfort became persistent. He’s reluctant and worried due to his father’s history of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
10,10,4,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial4,Case Report - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 74-year-old Caucasian male known as Mr. B. He is a retired mechanical engineer. His habitual history consists of 40 pack-years of smoking but quit about 15 years ago and maintains a modest intake of alcohol. He lives with his wife in a suburban environment and has three adult children. His weight has been consistent over the years with a BMI of 22.  Past Medical History: Mr. B's cardiovascular history is marked by hypertension for which he has been taking medication for the past 20 years. His compliance with the hypertensive regimen has been regularly assessed. His father died at the age of 80 due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). For this reason  Mr. B has been somewhat proactive about his heart health but has not undergone any screenings to specifically test for AAA. Other significant conditions include well-controlled Type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia for which the patient follows a properly managed diet and medication regimen. There are no known allergies to medicines.   Key Complaints: In the past month  Mr. B began experiencing intermittent  non-radiating  dull abdominal pain. Initially  he ignored it thinking it might be associated with indigestion and controlled it with over the counter medications. However  the pain didn't seem to abate  and he started having episodes of unexplained lower back discomfort. Recently  he noticed that the pain escalated while standing or during periods of exertion but partially subsided when he sat down or lay flat. This significant and unusual pain episode triggered him to visit the hospital out of concern. There has been no recent weight loss  fever  changes in bowel movements  or gastro-intestinal symptoms.  AAA is a deadly disease if not diagnosed on time. Both clinical and familial history of the patient appear to be significant for AAA. The symptoms that Mr. B currently presents could potentially be linked to this condition  however further examinations will be required to definitively diagnose the condition.
10,10,5,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial5,"Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information:  - Name: John Doe - Age: 74-year-old - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired mechanic  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has been under the treatment for the following conditions: - Hypertension for the past 12 years. - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 8 years  currently under control. - Hyperlipidemia evidenced by elevated LDL level (160 mg/dL). - Distant 40 pack-year smoking history. Quit smoking 10 years back. - His father passed away from a """"ruptured blood vessel"""" in the abdomen at age 82.  Main Complaints:  Mr. Doe has consulted the cardiothoracic department reporting the following symptoms: - Severe  sudden onset abdominal pain  more on the backside - Dizziness - He complains of excessive sweating and rapid heart rate - Has been experiencing an occasional pulsating feeling in the abdomen  On Physical Exam:  There's an exaggerated pulsatile mass palpable in the peri-umbilical area of the abdomen. He also has elevated blood pressure (160/100 mm Hg).  The above report will serve as our case study around abdominal aortic aneurysm  where students can work forward to evaluate the diagnosis and treatment plan for Mr. Doe.  The detailed history and the presenting complaints provide rich pointers towards an abdominal aortic aneurysm. However  to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity  further tests like ultrasound  CT angiography  or MRI may be required. Based on test results  discussions can revolve around possible interventions like surveillance  pharmacological management  or surgical procedures like endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or open surgery. It also opens the discussion for the management of other factors contributing to his condition like hypertension and diabetes."
10,10,6,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial6,Patient Information: Mr. Arnold Price  72-year-old Caucasian male  Past Medical History: Mr. Price has a history of severe hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). He has been a smoker for the past 50 years.  Chief Complaint: The patient presented to the ER with abrupt onset of severe abdominal pain which started 5 hours ago. He describes it as a tearing sensation  radiating to the back.  Further Assessment Required: As the primary differential diagnosis is an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  specific testing  such as abdominal ultrasound or CT and blood tests  may help validate this. The patient history raises the index of suspicion  particularly considering the age  gender  long-term smoking  and hypertension.     Teaching Points for Medical Students: 1. AAA usually affects men over 65 with a history of smoking and hypertension. 2. Typical symptoms include sudden abdominal or back pain  often described as severe or tearing. 3. AAA can quickly lead to life-threatening bleeding and needs immediate medical intervention. 4. Diagnostic options for suspected AAA includes abdominal ultrasound or CT scan. 5. Risk stratification and surgical repair are the mainstays of treatment  depending on the size of the aneurysm. 6. AAA often has no symptoms until rupture happens. Hence  surveillance among high-risk individuals through screening is crucial.  This brief case scenario can be further elaborated upon dependent upon the focus of teaching  whether it be clinical management  radiological diagnosis  surgical treatment  or more.

Physical Examination:  - On physical examination  there is visible abdominal pulsation and a palpable pulsating abdominal mass is detected  markedly tender on deeper palpation. - Blood pressure measurement reveals an elevated reading of 160/90 mmHg. - No bruits are heard on auscultation.  These symptoms are suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further investigations like an abdominal ultrasound  CT scan or MRI would be needed to confirm the diagnosis  evaluate the size and extent of the aneurysm. Management would depend on the size and growth rate of the aneurysm and may involve monitoring  lifestyle modifications  or surgical intervention.    Goals of Training Case:  - Identify risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm. - Understanding the common clinical presentation of untreated abdominal aortic aneurysm. - Learn about the differential diagnosis for abdominal and back pain in older adults. - Gain knowledge about diagnostic and management approaches for abdominal aortic aneurysm.

He is retired and lives at home with his wife in a suburb of the city. They have three adult children who live out of state.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson's medical history is significant for hypertension and high cholesterol. He is also a heavy smoker with a 50-pack-year history. He has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent angioplasty 8 years ago. There is no known family history of cardiovascular disease.  Social History:  Mr. Johnson is a retired military officer who now spends most of his time at home. He's sedentary  but enjoys walking his dog when weather permits. He has an extensive smoking history but quit two months ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally.  Presenting Complaints/History of Present Illness:  Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department complaining of severe  sudden onset of lower back pain that started roughly 2 hours ago. He described the pain as sharp  ripping and radiating to his back. He denies any previous similar pain. He also mentioned feeling vaguely lightheaded and nauseated. He has no changes in bowel or urinary habits. No fever  chills or other systemic symptoms are reported.  Given the patient’s history and clinical symptoms  the key things to consider would be a cardiac event or an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Considering that the pain radiates to his back and his history of smoking  an abdominal aortic aneurysm should be high on your list of differentials. The sudden onset of the pain could suggest rupture  which is a medical emergency. Further investigations like abdominal ultrasound or CT scan should be organized immediately to confirm diagnosis.

10,10,10,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial10,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 70 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: White Occupation: Retired Marital Status: Married Location: Urban Area Insurance Status: Medicare  Past Medical History: The patient is a former smoker  having quit smoking 10 years ago after a 40-year history of one pack per day. He was diagnosed with hypertension ten years ago which is controlled by losartan and hydrochlorothiazide. He has a history of high cholesterol for which he takes atorvastatin. His father passed away in his early 70s due to a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Key complaints: Mr. Doe presents to the outpatient clinic with complaints of unexplained  significant weight loss and chronic abdominal pain that sometimes radiates to his lower back. The abdominal pain is gnawing in nature and relatively constant but tends to intensify after meals. He also occasionally feels a pulsating sensation in his abdomen. He reports no fever  night sweats  changes in bowel habits or urinary symptoms.   Note to medical students: In elderly patients with a history of hypertension and smoking  such a clinical picture warrants a high suspicion of a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm. It is important to conduct a thorough physical examination and consider further diagnostic tests  like ultrasonography  to confirm its presence and evaluate its size. If the diagnosis is confirmed  immediate management strategies should be implemented due to the risk of rupture which can be potentially lethal. Further treatment decisions should involve the consideration of the patient's overall health status  the size of the aneurysm  and the associated risk factors.

10,10,12,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial12,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named Joseph. He is a recently retired construction worker from a small suburban neighborhood. Joseph is a reputed heavy smoker  smoking approximately two packs of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years.  Past Medical History: Joseph has a past medical history of hypertension  yet is somewhat inconsistent with his anti-hypertensive medication. He also has a history of high cholesterol levels and coronary artery disease  for which he underwent angioplasty five years ago. His surgical history includes a hernia repair done 20 years ago. His family history also reveals that his father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm  which was diagnosed incidentally during a routine health check-up.  Presenting Condition: Joseph came to the hospital emergency department complaining of severe  sharp abdominal pain that radiated to his back. He also reported feeling a pulse-like sensation in his abdomen. Additionally  Joseph has been struggling with unexplained weight loss and decreased appetite over the last few weeks. He is not taking any pain medications and denies any nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  or changes in bowel habits.  Evaluation: Vital signs are stable. On abdominal examination  a pulsatile mass in the mid and upper parts of the abdomen is palpable. Joseph looks in discomfort due to the pain. Lab investigations  including complete blood count  kidney function tests  and liver function tests  were ordered. An emergency ultrasound and CT scan were also performed  upon which a diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm was made.  Teaching Points: This case provides an opportunity to discuss the typical presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysm  risk factors  diagnosis  as well as management options. Comprehensive management of underlying risk factors such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia is of paramount importance. Students should be able to understand the value of differentiating abdominal aortic aneurysm from renal colic  pancreatitis  and other diseases that can present with acute abdominal pain.

He is a retired construction worker  a lifelong smoker  and has been dependent on alcohol for over 30 years. Mr. Smith has a past medical history of hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and peripheral vascular disease. He does not take his medications regularly due to his claims of forgetting and finding it difficult to follow a strict regimen. He lives alone and has no children or immediate family.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Smith presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden  severe  and constant pain in his lower back and abdomen  which started approximately one hour prior to arrival. He described the pain as “tearing” and stated it extended towards his flank and groin.  He also reported feeling lightheaded  with associated nausea and an episode of vomiting shortly before his arrival in the ER. He also reported noticing a pulsating sensation in his abdomen for the past few weeks  which he attributed to indigestion and hence did not seek medical attention.   On the day of presentation  he reported near syncope  forcing him to seek immediate medical help. Considering his past medical history and current complainants  the possibility of abdominal aortic aneurysm needs to be considered.   Vital Signs at Presentation: Blood pressure: 160/95 mmHg Pulse rate: 115 beats/min  regular Respiratory rate: 22 breaths/min Oxygen saturation (on room air): 92% Temperature: 98.5°F  On physical examination  he appears sweaty and stricken with pain  his abdomen is tender with a palpable pulse mass in the periumbilical region.

10,10,14,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial14,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Information:  Mr. John Barnes  68 years old  male  Caucasian  retired school teacher from Springfield  Illinois. He is a widower living alone  but has a supportive network of adult children and friends.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Barnes has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he is on medication. He is a former smoker who quit 15 years ago  with a history of smoking a pack a day for 30 years. He also has a history of peripheral vascular disease. He admits to seldom exercising and having a diet that includes high fat and high cholesterol foods. There is also family history of cardiovascular disease  his father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 55.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Barnes presents to the ambulatory care clinic with a one-week history of intermittent  moderate to severe abdominal pain  associated with a pulsating sensation that he can feel in his abdomen. Although he initially dismissed it as indigestion  he decided to seek medical attention because the pain did not subside and has recently begun radiating to his lower back. He has no associated nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  or weight loss. He has noticed some fatigue over this last week and increased frequency of urination  but attributed that to age. He does admit he has been feeling generally unwell this past week.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  Mr. Barnes has a palpable  pulsatile mass around the umbilical area that is tender on deep palpation. His vitals are stable  but his blood pressure is slightly elevated (145/95) which is unusual for his typically well-controlled hypertension. His heart sounds are normal  and lungs are clear on auscultation. Peripheral pulses are present and symmetrical.   Plan: Given his medical history and symptoms  there is suspicion for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Arrange for an urgent abdominal ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis. Percutaneous repair of the aneurysm is planned if the size of aneurysm is greater than 5.5cm or it is rapidly growing  symptomatic or leaking. Also  notify his family of the situation due to the potentially life-threatening nature of his condition. The prognosis and treatment options need to be discussed with the patient after confirming the diagnosis.   Learning Objectives: 1. To recognize the signs and symptoms of abdominal aortic aneurysm. 2. To understand the importance of early diagnosis and management of such cases. 3. To learn about the lifestyle modifications and treatment options available for these patients. 4. To manage patients with potentially life-threatening conditions and communicate effectively with them and their families.
10,10,15,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial15,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Information:  Name: John Doe Age: 68 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher    Medical History: The patient has a documented history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively for the past 10 years. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago but had a 30-pack year smoking history prior. There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases  particularly his father dying from an aortic aneurysm at age 72.  Presenting Complaints: The patient visited the clinic with chief complaints of consistent  dull pain in the central abdomen that often radiates to the lower back for last two months. He had also been experiencing fatigue and occasional shortness of breath when engaging in moderate physical activities such as gardening. He reported that the pain severity is gradually increasing. He denied any symptoms of chest pain  palpitations  dizziness or syncope.  On examination  a palpable pulsatile abdominal mass was detected  with a bruit on auscultation. Heart rate was regular  but blood pressure was on the higher side (160/95 mmHg).  These complaints and physical findings raise high suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Additional assessments  including an abdominal ultrasound or CT angiography  would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis and size of the aneurysm.  Through this case  medical students get the chance to learn about the typical presentation and risk factors of AAA  the significance of early detection in asymptomatic individuals  and the implications of AAA rupture. Furthermore  they can review the medical management and monitoring required for patients with AAA and the selection criteria for surgical interventions.

He is a retired engineer  widowed  and lives alone.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith is a former smoker who quit smoking 15 years ago after a 40-year habit. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are controlled with medication. However  his compliance is quite irregular. He also has a family history of cardiovascular disease  since his father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 65. He has no known drug allergies.  Key Complaints: Mr. Smith visited the emergency department complaining of a sudden severe pain in the middle of his abdomen that had started about an hour before his arrival. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" and rated it as nine out of ten in severity. The pain seemed to radiate to his back but has no associated symptoms such as nausea  vomiting  fever  or diarrhea. He also expressed a concern about the sudden onset of the pain  which he has never experienced before. He denies any recent trauma to the abdomen.  So far  Mr. Smith has refrained from any exercise or physical exertion due to a fear of causing any strains and generally leads a sedentary lifestyle. Upon further questioning  he divulges that he has been feeling weak and fatigued for the past few months  and occasionally experiences dizziness  but he believed these symptoms were due to aging rather than a specific medical condition. He also appears anxious and disturbed because of these ongoing health complaints.  Notes to the Educator: This case is designed to highlight the key features of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  a potentially life-threatening condition if not diagnosed and treated promptly. The symptoms highlighted in this case  such as severe and sudden abdominal pain radiating to the back  may initially draw attention to other differential diagnoses - leading medical students through various exploratory paths. However  the patient’s risk factors of age  history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  family history of cardiovascular disease  along with the nature  location and severity of pain should guide them towards the correct diagnosis eventually. Remember to discuss the importance of detailed patient history and comprehensive clinical examination in making correct diagnosis."

The pain is described as a deep  gnawing sensation concentrated around his naval region. Also  he reported having noticed a pulsatile mass in his abdomen while lying in bed. He hasn't experienced any loss of consciousness  episodes of claudication  or significant weight loss.  His primary care physician referred Mr. Smith for further investigation based on the classic signs of an abdominal aortic aneurysm  including chronic backache and the presence of a palpable pulsatile abdominal mass  in conjunction with the patient's risk factors including advanced age  history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  smoking  and a family history of cardiac anomalies.  As medical students preparing for a career in healthcare  your task is to ascertain the diagnosis and propose a management plan for Mr. Smith  employing this case for understanding key risk factors  clinical symptoms  diagnostic techniques  and management options for abdominal aortic aneurysm.
10,10,21,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial21,Patient Profile:   Mr. James Doyle  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  appeared for a routine check-up at the clinic.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Doyle has a documented history of hypertension for the past ten years which is currently managed with antihypertensive medication. He smoked around 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 45 years but quit smoking approximately ten years ago. He has moderate alcohol consumption and he lacks regular physical activity. His family history reveals that his father had an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 75.  Current Complaint and Preliminary Examination:  Mr. Doyle has been experiencing uncharacteristic mild abdominal discomfort over the past two weeks. He expressed that the pain is an intermittent  sharp ache in the center and lower part of his abdomen. Pain is not related to meals and no significant weight loss or change in bowel habits has been noted. No signs of Melena  Hematochezia or any alarming GI symptoms.   On physical examination  Mr. Doyle is slightly overweight with BMI 27. Vital signs including blood pressure are within normal limits due to the antihypertensive medication. An abdominal examination reveals a pulsatile mass in the midline of his abdomen  which feels about the size of a grapefruit. No apparent Murphy's sign  Rovsing's sign  or Psoas sign was found  ruling out acute abdominal issues. Given the familial predisposition and the unusual symptoms  a screening for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm is to be considered. An ultrasound of the abdomen or a CT scan is expected to confirm the diagnosis to rule out other common causes of abdominal pain like gallstone disease  peptic ulcer disease  or pancreatitis.   Note: Final diagnosis to be made after investigations. Whether or not the determined Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm is small or large  intervention may need to be considered given the symptomatic presentation. This case should be utilized to discuss the risk factors  presentation  diagnosis and management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.

10,10,23,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial23,Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male  who has come in for a routine check-up. He presents with a history of smoking (30 years)  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).   History of Present Illness: The patient denies any current complaints such as abdominal  back  or flank pain  or any symptoms related to hypotension such as lightheadedness  dizziness  or syncope. However  he mentions an occasional pulsating sensation in his middle abdominal region.  Past Medical/ Surgical History: He was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 15 years ago but has been managing them with medications. He also underwent a left hip replacement surgery 5 years back.  Social History: He is a retired school principal  lives with his wife  and they have three grown-up children. He’s quit smoking for a year now.  Family History: The patient’s father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 72. One brother  presently 70 years of age  was diagnosed with an AAA two years ago which was successfully repaired. Patient’s mother died of stroke at 79  and he has a sister at 65 who is in good health.  Review of Systems: Cardiovascular System: Asymptomatic  no chest pain or discomfort  no known heart diseases  regular check-ups for hypertension. GI system: No loss of appetite  no unexplained weight loss or weight gain  denied any bowel or chewing and swallowing difficulties. Respiratory System: Quit smoking a year back  no COPD  Shortness of breath or any known lung diseases.  Physical Examination: The patient is afebrile with a BP of 135/85 mmHg  HR 82 bpm and in regular rhythm  RR 16 breaths/minute  oxygen saturation 98% on room air. His abdomen is soft and non-tender  no visible or palpable mass  but a high-pitched bruit over the periumbilical area is heard  synchronous with the heartbeat.  At this point  based on the history and examination findings  particularly the bruit over the periumbilical area in a background of a significant family history of AAA  our leading differential diagnosis includes abdominal aortic aneurysm. The management plan would involve confirmation of our diagnosis with imaging studies  including abdominal ultrasound and CT angiogram where appropriate.

He has noticed that his appetite has diminished with an associated weight loss and occasional swelling in the legs. There has been no associated vomiting  palpitations  fainting episodes  changes in bowel movements  or urination. He denies fever  chest pain  or shortness of breath.  Through a training case focused on abdominal aortic aneurysm  medical students can learn to take complete patient histories  recognize key symptoms  process physical examination findings  and make diagnostic decisions.
10,10,25,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial25,Case Report:  Patient Identification: Mr. James Martin  a 72-year-old Caucasian male residing in Massachusetts.  Past Medical History: Mr. Martin is a retired officer from the military who has been generally healthy throughout his life. He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. The patient has hyperlipidemia  controlled with daily statins. No known history of hypertension  diabetes  or allergies. He has no known family history of cardiovascular disease. The patient has no previous history of abdominal surgery.  Present Complaints: He reports a 1-month history of intermittent  vague abdominal pain and some unexplained weight loss despite no changes in diet or appetite. He has also noticed a mild increase in frequency of micturition and discomfort in the lower back which he attributed to his age. He has no history of fresh rectal bleeding  black stools  nausea  vomiting  chills  or fever. He reports occasional dizziness without syncope.  These troublesome symptoms coupled with his age and smoking history point toward an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). To validate this suspicion  medical practitioners should conduct a comprehensive physical examination  focusing on the abdominal area  and recommend necessary diagnostic procedures such as abdominal ultrasound and CT scan. The case progresses into the diagnosis  management  and preventative care of AAAs  inherently shedding light on their etiology  pathology  prognostic factors  and implications.
10,10,26,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial26,Case Report  Patient Details:   Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 69 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  Marital Status: Married  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson is a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago after a 25-year history of smoking. He has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and high cholesterol  both of which haven't been adequately managed due to his poor compliance with medication protocols. He also suffers from coronary artery disease and had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago. There is no known history of connective tissue disorders or any aortic disease in his family.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency room with sudden onset of severe  sharp lower abdominal and back pain that started approximately 2 hours ago and has progressively worsened. He has also been feeling lightheaded and has experienced one episode of vomiting.  After seeking initial help from his wife  he felt a brief loss of consciousness which was the key reason his wife called for an ambulance service. His past couple of weeks have been marred with episodic discomfort in his abdomen  which he shrugged off as indigestion issues. He denies any recent trauma  chest pain  shortness of breath  or other symptoms.  Emergency triage indicates low blood pressure and a high heart rate. On examination  there is a pulsatile mass palpable in his abdomen. The pain score is 8 on a scale of 1 to 10  with 10 being the severe pain.  This case intends to help medical students understand the presentation and urgency of proper diagnosis and management of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  focusing on the importance of recognizing key signs and symptoms  and the need for urgent surgical consultation and intervention. This case will further delve into the potential complications  prognosis  and post-operative care of a patient with AAA.
10,10,27,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial27,Patient Information: Mr. Robert Thompson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired accountant  living in urban Middlesex. He is a non-smoker but occasionally partakes in moderated drinking.  Past Medical History (PMH): Mr. Thompson has a known history of hypertension for which he takes a daily prescription of Lisinopril. He has no history of diabetes or other major diseases. He has major cardiovascular risk factors; he is overweight with a BMI of 30. Other notable aspects of his PMH include Hyperlipidaemia and a family history of aneurysms (his father died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm).  Key Complaints: 1. The patient reports a sudden  severe abdominal pain that is felt in the middle or upper abdomen.  2. Onset of severe lower back pain  not associated with any movements or straining. 3. Shortness of breath and feeling of fullness in the abdomen. 4. Palpable pulse in the belly. 5. Losing consciousness quickly and alarming decrease in heart rate and blood pressure during a physical examination in the clinic.  Aside from the complaints  the patient also notes unintended  recent weight loss and feeling fatigue  even on minimal exertion. The pain in his abdomen  he reports  is not alleviated by over-the-counter pain relievers and seems unrelated to meals or even posture. He denies any chest pain  changes in bowel habits  urinary symptoms  or recent illnesses.  Clinical Concern: Given Mr. Thompson's age  predisposing factors  his familial history and especially his symptoms  there is a significant concern for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). If not promptly evaluated and treated  this could prove potentially life-threatening.
10,10,28,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial28,Case Report - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Profile: Mr. John Anderson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  a retired army officer  presented to the clinic.

Presenting Complaints: Mr. Anderson visited the clinic for a routine annual health review. Recently  he has noticed a visible abdominal pulsation  which was previously absent. In addition to this  he complained of intermittent  dull abdominal pain for the last three months  which he attributed to gastric issues. He denies having chest pain  shortness of breath  back pain  extremity pain  or unexplained weight loss. His bowel and bladder habits are normal  and he does not have any dietary or sleep issues.  Note: This case intends to introduce the presentation  diagnosis  and management of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a patient with significant risk factors - male  advanced age  smoker  family history  and hypertension. A comprehensive approach towards evaluation  including radiological diagnostic techniques  risk stratification  and therapeutic options  including watchful waiting versus stent-grafting versus surgical intervention  can be discussed with this case. The aim is to emphasise the significance of early detection and appropriate management of AAA due to its potential fatal complications  such as rupture.
10,10,29,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial29,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information Name: J.D. Smith Age: 68 years old Gender: Male  Demographics Mr. Smith is a retired engineer. He's divorced and lives alone. He has two adult children and four grandchildren.  Past Medical History Mr. Smith is a former smoker having quit 15 years ago  after a 30 year pack-a-day habit. He drinks alcohol moderately  about one to two glasses of wine per week.  He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia that have been managed with medications (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin) for the past ten years. He also had an appendectomy in his mid-forties. He has no known drug allergies.    Key Complaints Mr. Smith's chief complaint is ongoing dull lower back pain for several weeks. The pain usually occurs in the morning and also after physical activity. He also reports discomfort when lying on his stomach and has had difficulty putting on his shoes because his stomach becomes unusually tight when he bends over. He states the pain is not related to meals or bowel movements.   He also experienced spells of unexplained fatigue and an unusually rapid heartbeat on rare occasions. Mr. Smith denies other symptoms such as fever  chills  night sweats  weight loss  changes in bowel or bladder function  cough  or chest pain.  This case report should provide a good starting point for a discussion on identifying risk factors  diagnosing  and treating abdominal aortic aneurysm.
10,10,30,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial30,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 66 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer Marital Status: Married Insurance: Medicare  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension for the last 10 years managed by medication  smoking around 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years  moderate alcohol consumption  and hyperlipidemia.  Presenting Complaints: The patient came to the emergency department complaining of severe  sudden onset abdominal pain radiating to his lower back  lasting for a few hours now. He had no history of similar pain in the past. Additional symptoms include lightheadedness and a feeling of 'something pulsating' inside his abdomen. No complaints of chest pain  shortness of breath  or loss of consciousness.  On examination  a pulsatile mass is noted in the abdomen and a bruit heard on auscultation. The patient's initial vital signs show a blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg  heart rate of 92 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.  Given the symptoms and the patient's smoking history  a suspicion of abdominal aortic aneurysm is considered. An urgent CT scan of the abdomen is planned to confirm the diagnosis and assess the size of the aneurysm. Meanwhile  the healthcare team begins to manage his blood pressure and pain. The patient is prepared for possible emergency surgery depending on the CT results  given the concern for aneurysm rupture.   Teaching points for students: 1. Risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm: not forgetting smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  advanced age  and male gender.  2. Typical presentation: often asymptomatic until it becomes large or ruptures. However  sudden  severe  and persistent abdominal or back pain can indicate a ruptured AAA.  3. Importance of physical examination: a pulsatile mass in the abdomen can be an important clue.  4. Emergent management: controlling blood pressure  pain management and preparing patient for possible surgery. 5. Diagnostic imaging: ultrasound can be used for initial diagnosis but CT scan is gold standard to assess size and extent.    6. Complications: rupture leading to hypovolemic shock is a life-threatening complication.
10,10,31,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial31,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Mr. John Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the Emergency Department by ambulance.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  well-managed on hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin respectively. He was a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history but quit smoking 15 years ago.   Chief Complaints: Mr. Smith's primary complaint was the sudden onset of severe lower back and abdominal pain. He described the pain as a sharp  constant  and tearing  rated at 8/10 intensity  which began around two hours prior to arrival at ED.   He reported feeling light-headed but denied chest pain  shortness of breath  changes in vision  difficulty speaking  weakness  numbness  or difficulty moving his limbs. No recent trauma  fever  or other associated symptoms were reported.  Physical Exam:  On examination  patient was anxious and diaphoretic with an abdominal exam notable for a pulsatile mass in the upper midline of the abdomen.  Vitals: The patient's blood pressure on admission was 180/90 mmHg and his heart rate was 100 bpm. The patient had no fever and his respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were within normal range.  Given the patient's age  history  and current symptoms  a comprehensive diagnostic workup was arranged suspecting a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.   The purpose of this case is to teach medical students the classical presentation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm potentially rupturing. Rapid identification and intervention are critical in this life-threatening condition. It also highlights essential aspects of a focused history and physical exam in the context of acute  severe abdominal pain. It's important to remind students about the role of various risk factors like age  male sex  smoking history  hypertension and high cholesterol. This case can serve as a platform for discussion about various investigative modalities like ultrasound or CT  and the rationale for choosing one over the other in different scenarios.
10,10,32,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial32,Patient Profile:  - Patient: Mr. John Doe - Gender: Male - Age: 65 years - Occupation: Retired engineer - Ethnicity: Caucasian  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he's on medication  including a statin and a beta-blocker. He also has a 30-year history of smoking  though he quit ten years ago. His father passed away from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at age 70.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Doe visited the clinic with a complaint of intermittent dull abdominal pain for the past 2 weeks. He also reported occasional lower back pain and unexplained weight loss despite his good appetite. More recently  he has felt the presence of a pulsatile mass in his abdomen that sometimes throbs. He decided to seek medical attention as the frequency and the intensity of the symptoms were gradually increasing.  This is a typical case presentation consistent with an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. In clinical practice  many abdominal aortic aneurysms are often asymptomatic and detected as incidental findings on imaging studies. However  this case provides a classic presentation and should facilitate a discussion of risk factors  symptoms  diagnostic testing  and management options. It's also important to discuss the emergency management of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.
10,10,33,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial33,Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  a 72-year-old Caucasian male retiree.  Presenting Complaint: The patient reports to the clinic due to intermittent abdominal pain  and discomfort which he has been having for the last month. The pain is sharp  located in the middle of his abdomen  and radiates to his back.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe was diagnosed with high blood pressure 10 years ago  which has been controlled on medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily). He is also a 40-pack-year smoker  though he quit smoking 5 years ago. He has no known allergies. He also has a history of high cholesterol controlled with statins. His father passed away at 80 from a ruptured aortic aneurysm  and his mother had hypertension and died of stroke aged 78. He denies any history of kidney or liver disease  diabetes  or peripheral arterial disease.  Summary of Results: Full physical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass. No significant peripheral edema or cyanosis were observed. His skin is normal  without any notable lesions  and his abdomen is not distended  bowel sounds are present. But deep palpation produced tenderness in the middle abdomen where the pulsatile mass was located.  The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Standard laboratory test results including blood panel and urinalysis were all within normal limits. However  an ultrasound of the abdomen was conducted due to his complaint of abdominal pain and revealed an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 4.5 cm in diameter.   Subsequent urgent computed tomography angiography confirmed the presence of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm  4.5 cm in diameter  without signs of rupture or leaking.  Working/Impression: Abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation and potential endovascular or open surgical repair given the family history and size of the aneurysms. The patient and his family were educated about the condition  including the risks and signs of rupture. He was counseled to return to the emergency department if he experienced sudden onset of severe abdominal or back pain.
10,10,34,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial34,Patient Demographics: Name: John Doe Age: 66 years  Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupational History: Retired factory worker  history of moderate tobacco use of 40 years (stopped 2 years back)  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: Diagnosed 10 years ago  on regular medication (Lisinopril) 2. Dyslipidemia: 5 years ago  taking atorvastatin  3. Family history of cardiovascular diseases   Present Complaints: Patient visited his primary care physician complaining of recurrent  dull and gnawing abdominal pain for the past 2 weeks. The pain radiated to the back. He also mentioned that he was feeling a pulsating sensation in his abdomen intermittently. Additionally  the patient reported episodes of lightheadedness but denied symptoms such as chest pain  shortness of breath  nausea  vomiting  and loss of consciousness. He also noticed a significant unintentional weight loss over the past few months.   Additional information  not directly reported by the patient but can be crucial to the diagnosis:  During the clinical examination  the physician palpated a hard and pulsatile abdominal mass. Physical examination also demonstrated high blood pressure (160/95 mm Hg). No bruits were heard over the abdomen. Blood tests were ordered which showed elevated levels of serum cholesterol.   Note: This case is designed for teaching purposes  and it is not a real patient case. The demographic information  past medical history  and presenting complaints point towards a clinical suspicion of a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Further diagnostic tests like ultrasound or CT angiogram should be considered for the diagnosis. This case could lead to discussions about the risk factors  diagnosis  management  and complications of AAA. 
10,10,35,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial35,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  a retired truck driver  with a history of heavy smoking (1.5 packs per day for 45 years)  moderate alcohol consumption (up to 8 standard drinks per week)  and sporadic physical activity. He is married and has three children  all in good health. He lives in a suburban area and presents no known allergies. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  specifically  his father suffered from an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and died from its rupture at the age of 70.  Past Medical History: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  diagnosed seven years ago and managed with regular medication. He also has a background of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both controlled with medication. He previously had a myocardial infarction at age 54  treated with angioplasty. The patient's late life diagnosis involved type 2 diabetes mellitus around age 60  which he controls with lifestyle modifications and metformin. There are no diagnosed genetic conditions in the patient.  Key Complaints: The patient's primary complaint is recent-onset  intermittent  non-radiating abdominal and lower back pain that is dull in nature and not associated with meals or physical activity. The pain does not improve with his regular COPD or hypertension medications and rest. He also complains of being recently aware of a pulsating sensation in his stomach but did not pay it any attention earlier. The patient denies any bowel or bladder changes  loss of consciousness  or related symptoms. He also mentions unintentional weight loss in the last few months. On a physical exam  the physician notes a tender  pulsatile mass in the patient's abdomen.  This case report presents the typical demographic and clinical context of AAA—a disease often linked with older age  male gender  smoking  and a history of cardiovascular diseases. It emphasizes the high-risk nature of the patient's lifestyle and genetic predisposition. It introduces some of the potential presenting symptoms of AAA (lower back pain  abdominal pain  pulsating sensation in the abdomen)  which often go unnoticed or are non-specific  thereby emphasizing the importance of a thorough history and comprehensive physical examination in clinical practice.
10,10,36,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial36,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Graham Jones  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired electrical engineer  presents to the clinic with his wife for a routine visit. He is a former 30-pack year smoker but quit 10 years ago. He admits to social drinking but no illicit drug use. His family history is significant for heart diseases  with his father dying from a myocardial infarction at the age of 70.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Jones has a medical history of hypertension for the past 10 years  and hyperlipidaemia for which he takes Amlodipine 5mg daily and Atorvastatin 20mg daily respectively. He had a minor stroke 4 years ago with no lasting neurological deficit and takes Aspirin 81mg daily as prophylaxis. He also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  likely secondary to his smoking history  which is well managed on Tiotropium Bromide. He also has a history of peptic ulcer disease treated and resolved 3 years ago.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Jones's wife informs that in the past two months  he has reported intermittent lower back pain and abdominal discomfort. They both thought this is due to his age and ignored it. She further states that he occasionally feels lightheaded even while seated  which has never happened before. On direct questioning  Mr. Jones admits to feeling a pulsating sensation in his abdomen.  Considering the patient's advanced age  history of smoking  presence of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia  reporting of lower back pain and a pulsating feeling in his abdomen  screening for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is warranted. The next step would include a physical examination followed by diagnostic tests like abdominal ultrasound  CT scan  or MRI for an accurate diagnosis.

Past Medical History: The patient has a long-standing history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He was diagnosed with coronary artery disease five years ago and underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He also has a family history of vascular diseases  with his father dying from an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture.  Key Complaints: The patient presented to the emergency department with acute severe abdominal and back pain  which he described as a sharp  tearing sensation. This pain in the last four hours has been unremitting and gradually growing worse. He denies any chest pain  dyspnea  nausea  vomiting  or changes in bowel or bladder habits. He looks pale and somewhat diaphoretic and is extremely anxious.
10,10,38,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial38,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Mr. A  70-year-old Caucasian male  retired military officer  residing in a suburban locality. He is married and has two grown-up children.   Past Medical History: Mr. A has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and is a former smoker who quit approximately 15 years ago. He has been compliant with his antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medications. Mr. A's father had a history of death from a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 72.   Key Complaint:  Mr. A visited the Emergency Room with a primary complaint of sudden onset severe pain in the abdomen  which he described as unusually sharp and intense. He also reported a sense of fullness in his abdomen  light-headedness  and a feeling of anxiety. He denied any previous episodes of similar pain. He reported no other associated symptoms such as changes in bowel habits  urinary complaints  leg pain or claudication  and loss of consciousness.  Clinical examination revealed a pulsating mass in the abdomen  slightly tenderness on deep palpation along the midline of the abdomen  and normal pulse in bilateral lower extremities. Blood pressure readings were slightly elevated  but within reasonable limits given the patient's pain and anxiety.  These clinical and medical history findings led to an immediate suspicion of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) risking rupture. An urgent CT scan was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the aneurysm.  Learning Points:  1. Importance of detailed history taking  identifying risk factors (Age  Male  Hypertension  Smoking  Family History). 2. AAA usually stays asymptomatic and is usually detected accidentally. Keeping a high degree of suspicion  especially in high-risk patients  can lead to early diagnosis and treatment. 3. Early identification and management of AAA are crucial in order to prevent rupture and associated risk of sudden death.
10,10,39,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial39,Patient Details  Name: Richard Sullivan  Age: 68 years Sex: Male Occupation: Retired Ethnicity: Caucasian Living Situation: Living alone in suburban setting with aid from a caregiver.  Past Medical History: Known case of hypertension  fully controlled with meds for the past 10 years. Smoker for 35 years  quit 5 years ago. Moderate alcohol consumption. No known cardiac disease  no chronic kidney disease  no diabetes. No known surgeries. Previously worked in a stressful corporate job.  Presenting Complaints:  Richard has been generally feeling well until about a week ago when he started experiencing a constant  dull pain in his lower abdomen  distinct from his occasional acid reflux pain. The pain didn't intensify with meals nor improve after a bowel movement. Over the past few days  he also reported intermittent episodes of severe back pain.   On further inquiry  he reported feeling a throbbing sensation in his abdomen which made him worry. He denied any fever  chills  changes in bowel or bladder habits  significant weight loss or changes in appetite. Over-the-counter analgesics provided temporary partial relief.   This case can then delve into Richard's physical examination findings  suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  such as a pulsatile abdominal mass  followed by appropriate lab tests and imaging to confirm the diagnosis. The management  prognosis and follow-up can then be discussed  focusing on the importance of smoking cessation  blood pressure control and suitable medical/surgical treatments.

10,10,41,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial41,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Demographics: The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  a retiree who previously worked as a construction engineer. He has been a smoker for well over 45 years but has made several unsuccessful attempts to quit. The patient lives with his wife and is fairly active despite advanced age. He has three adult children and six grandchildren. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His diet is mostly balanced  but he possesses a habitual preference for fried foods.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a history of chronic hypertension controlled with Lisinopril 20mg daily  for the past 10 years. Diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 8 years ago  he has been taking atorvastatin 20mg daily thereafter. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus five years previous and has been managing it with Metformin 500mg two times a day. His last HbA1c reading 2 months ago was 7.2%.  Key Complaints: Mr. Johnson presents to the clinic complaining of intermittent abdominal pain and lower back pain for the last two weeks. He further complaints of a throbbing sensation in his abdomen. He has not experienced any weight loss  changes in bowel habits  blood in stool  or nausea/vomiting. His pain does not radiate and does not seem to be associated with food intake.   Physical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass that is tender to palpation. No bowel sounds are ausculted over the mass. A bruit is heard over the mass on auscultation. Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems is unremarkable.   Lab results show moderate leukocytosis and elevated serum creatinine levels. Electrocardiogram and chest x-ray results are within normal limits.  This case scenario focuses on an elderly patient with risk factors (smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  advanced age) and classical symptoms (abdominal and back pain  pulsatile mass) of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The next steps would involve appropriate imaging to confirm the diagnosis followed by potential surgical or endovascular intervention depending on the patient’s condition.
10,10,42,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial42,"Subject: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Training Case Report  Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired police officer  presents to the office today.   Past Medical History: He has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both managed pharmacologically  additionally he has a 50 pack year history of smoking. He used to smoke 1 pack/day for 50 years  but he quit 15 years ago. He’s had no previous surgeries and there’s also no known history of aneurysms in first-degree relatives.   Chief Complaints: Mr. Doe came to the clinic today with an unusual complaint - he described a few episodes of back pain which was throbbing in nature and lasted for a couple of hours these past weeks; his pain seems to be unrelated to physical activities. He also reported experiencing a """"pulsating feeling"""" in his abdomen. He denied any fever  chest pain  shortness of breath  lower limb pain  syncope  rapid weight loss  or changes in bowel or bladder habits. His appetite remains good.   Upon examination  a pulsatile abdominal mass was palpable. Vital signs are within normal limits and cardiovascular examination showed regular heart beats without murmur  no bruits were noted over the abdomen. The remainder of the examination including respiratory and neurological systems was unremarkable.   This clinical presentation necessitates further investigation considering his age  gender  smoking history  and the described symptoms. The leading suspicion here should be an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The primary screening tool for suspected AAA should be abdominal ultrasound due to its accessibility  cost  and safety.   This case can be used to illustrate the risk factors for AAA development  the typical presentation  and the initial diagnostic approach. Furthermore  one can also discuss the potential complications of untreated AAA  including rupture and ensuing vascular emergency  making the timely detection of AAA crucial for preventing significant morbidity or mortality.   Keep in mind that the case  diagnostic workup  and management vary on a case-by-case basis. This fictitious scenario serves to guide discussion and highlight important elements in managing similar real-life situations."
10,10,43,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial43,Patient Details:  Name: Mr. John Smith  Age: 73  Sex: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired mechanical engineer   Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he takes medication. He also has a 30 pack-year history of smoking but quit 15 years ago. His father died at the age of 68 from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).   Chief Complaint:  Mr. Smith came in for a routine check-up but casually mentions that he has noticed a 'pulsing' feeling in his abdomen and occasional dull aching lower back pain for the last 3 months. The pain is usually relieved with rest. He denies any symptoms of loss of appetite  weight loss  changes in bowel or bladder habits  or unusual weakness or fatigue.  Clinical Query:  Given Mr. Smith's symptoms  risk factors (male  over 65  history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  and family history of AAA)  and physical examination findings (perceptible abdominal pulsation)  an abdominal aortic aneurysm becomes a high possibility that needs to be evaluated.   The training case should focus on recognizing the risk factors and symptoms of AAA  the importance of screening high risk patients  understanding the relevant diagnostic procedures such as abdominal ultrasound or CT scan  and the potential treatments like endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or open surgical repair. It should also highlight the high risk of rupture and the importance of urgent intervention for larger aneurysms.

He is of medium build  height 5'9"""". He is a 40 pack-year smoker but trying to quit  obese (BMI: 30.2)  a moderate drinker  and does not partake in any regular physical activities.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia over the past ten years. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago and has peripheral artery disease diagnosed two years ago. He has been prescribed antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril)  statins for hyperlipidemia  and metformin for diabetes. His paternal grandfather underwent surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm at 75.  Chief Complaint:  Mr. A reports experiencing unfamiliar  """"gnawing"""" pain in his abdomen and lower back  which he describes as being """"deep"""" and “persistent” for the last two weeks. He notes that the pain is not related to eating or physical activity  but it does appear to get slightly worse when he lies down. He also mentions experiencing episodes of dizziness and mild shortness of breath.  The brief history and patient's demographic profile raise clinical suspicion towards possible abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The next step would be to establish this differential diagnosis through physical exam and appropriate diagnostic imaging. It is also crucial to assess AAA's size and rupture risk  the patient's overall health  and surgical risk to develop an appropriate management plan."

Past Medical History:   Mr. Waters was diagnosed with Hypertension 20 years ago  treated with Lisinopril 20mg daily  and controlled. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia managed with 40mg Atorvastatin daily. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus approximately 10 years ago and is currently on Metformin 500mg twice daily  with fairly stable blood glucose values. He has never provided a history of familial cardiovascular disease.   Key Complaints:  Mr. Waters sought consultation because  over the past two weeks  he has been experiencing recurrent  severe abdominal and back pain. The pain doesn't radiate  and it eases when he assumes a fetal position. He reported no change in bowel or urinary habits  no blood in stools or urine  and no loss of appetite. However  he has experienced a notable weight loss of around 6 lbs in the last month  which he attributes to his stress over the persistent pain. The physical exam revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass.  It is crucial to emphasize the correlation between the patient's risk factors like old age  male gender  history of smoking  hypertension  and the disease's familial tendency with the suspected Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). This case can further be developed to discuss diagnostic approaches (such as ultrasound and CT angiography)  management options  and potential complications related to AAA.

His vitals at present are: B.P - 168/92 mmHg  HR - 112  Temp - 98.6 °F  Respiration rate - 22  Oxygen saturation - 97%. Physical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass.  Initial Assessment: These symptoms and findings suggest an underlying abdominal aortic aneurysm. It is pertinent to conduct necessary diagnostic tests  such as an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan  to confirm the diagnosis. The history of hypertension and smoking further increases his risk of an aneurysm. The sudden  severe abdominal pain  coupled with the patient's history and examination findings  suggests a possible rupture  which  if not managed immediately  can be life-threatening.
10,10,62,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial62,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Patient Information:  Mr. Jones  a 70-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient complains of persistent abdominal pain and back pain that has lasted for approximately two weeks. He has noted that the pain becomes more intense after meals and occasionally feels a palpable abdominal mass.  Past Medical  Surgical  Social and Family History:  He has had a 20-year history of high blood pressure  for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide. He also has a history of smoking about 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years  although he quit smoking 10 years ago. He reports moderate alcohol consumption of one drink per day. He has no previous surgical history. His father died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 75.  Medication:  Hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension.  Physical Examination:   BP: 150/90  HR: 85 bpm  Temp: 98.6°F  RR: 16/min  BMI: 27  Abdominal exam reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass. The patient exhibits tenderness on palpation. Bowel sounds are present. No other abnormal physical findings.  Based on the initial examination and the patient's medical history  an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was suspected. A CT scan should be ordered to confirm.   This student case is designed to highlight risk factors (age  male sex  smoking history  hypertension  family history)  classic symptoms (abdominal pain  back pain  palpable abdominal mass)  and steps to confirm the diagnosis for learning about AAA. An emphasis on early detection  careful monitoring and elective surgery before rupture is important in the subsequent management discussion.  
10,10,63,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial63,Case Presentation:  Patient Demographics: Mr. Smith  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  residing in Ontario  Canada.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith is a known hypertensive and smoker for the past 50 years. He also has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. There's no known allergy reported. He has high cholesterol levels and is currently under medication. His father died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) at 72.   Key Complaints:  Mr. Smith presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset severe abdominal pain radiating to his back for the past 12 hours. The pain  initially negligent  has progressively worsened over time. There is no history of trauma. He reports feeling pulses in his stomach  mild nausea  but no vomiting  changes in bowel or bladder habit or fevers. He has never experienced similar pain before. He does not report any loss of weight  changes in appetite  or any other systemic symptoms.   Emergency medical technicians reported that he looked pale and sweaty on arrival. His vital signs included BP 150/90 mmHg  pulse 85 bpm  temperature: 98.2°F  and respiration: 20 breaths per minute.   This case presentation is deliberately ambiguous at this stage to open discussion regarding differential diagnoses (including AAA  renal colic  myocardial infarction  pancreatitis  etc.). Further exploration  physical examination  and appropriate diagnostic tests will lead towards a diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
10,10,64,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial64,Case Study: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: John Doe  a 67-year-old Caucasian male with a BMI of 28  presents to the clinic. He's a retired construction worker  a widow living alone  and has two adult children. He's a former smoker and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption.   Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has been previously diagnosed with Hypertension (controlled with Amlodipine)  Hypercholesterolemia (taking Simvastatin)  and a history of mild obesity. His surgical history is significant for an appendectomy in his early 20s. He had a smoking history of 30 pack years but quit 10 years ago. His father died in his late 60’s of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).   Chief Complaints: Over the past two months  Mr. Doe has been experiencing mild to moderate  intermittent abdominal pain  localized in the center and slightly towards the left. The pain does not radiate  and there is no noticeable pattern with eating or bowel movements. He describes it as a dull ache and denies any associated symptoms like nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  or changes in bowel habit. He also reports that he has noticed an unusual pulsation feeling in his abdomen while he is lying down.   He does not have any symptoms of palpitations  chest pain  dyspnea  orthopnea  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  edema  claudication or syncope. However  he does report a recent weight loss of around 4 kilograms in the last 2 months but he attributes it to better dietary control. He denies any changes in appetite  fever  night sweats  urinary or mental symptoms.  He has no known allergies and his vaccinations are up-to-date. He visits his primary physician for regular check-ups.  On this basis of the case history  an investigation of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) should be initiated  considering his age  sex  past medical history  and familial predisposition. The symptom of perceived pulsation may correspond with the aneurysm's growth. 
10,10,65,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial65,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics: Mr. Richard Miller  a 67-year old African American male  retired construction worker  presents during a routine checkup.  Past Medical History: Patient has a history of smoking two packs a day for 40 years but quit five years ago. He is known to have hypertension controlled with medication (Lisinopril). He also has hypercholesterolemia  managed with statins (Atorvastatin). Relevant family history includes his father who died suddenly at the age of 70 due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Chief Complaint: Patient reports intermittent lower back pain over the past 4 months; he attributes it to his past line of work and age. He takes over-the-counter NSAIDs  which provides minimal relief. He also mentions occasional  vague abdominal discomfort. No history of fever  weight loss  other systemic complaints  or conditions that could cause increased pressure on the aorta  such as COPD.  During the current visit  the patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated at 145/90 mmHg (despite compliant with medication)  heart rate is 76 bpm  and all other vital signs are normal. Physical examination reveals a mildly pulsatile abdominal mass. A bruit is heard on auscultation over the mass.  [Given the risk factors and clinical presentation  a suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is raised and the patient is referred for further diagnostic imaging.]  This educational case focuses on the importance of recognizing nonspecific symptoms such as back pain and vague abdominal discomfort in older individuals with risk factors (smoking  hypertension  and family history). Early detection is crucial in managing a potentially life-threatening abdominal aortic aneurysm.
10,10,66,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial66,Patient Case: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: The patient is a 70-year-old African American male named Charles. He resides in an urban area and is a retired truck driver. Charles is single and lives alone with limited support from distant relatives.   Past Medical History:  Charles has a significant past medical history including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from a 30+ year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day (quit smoking 10 years ago)  hypertension that is generally well-controlled with medication  and obesity (Body Mass Index =30.3 kg/m2). Additionally  he has a family history of vascular pathology and his father died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture when he was in his mid 70s.  Presenting Complaints:  Charles came to the clinic for his regular check-up but reported recent onset of vague and intermittent abdominal pain and lower back discomfort spanning over the past couple of months  which he initially attributed to arthritis. The pain appears unrelated to meals or physical activity.   Key Symptoms for Consideration: 1. Intermittent abdominal and lower back pain 2. Long history of hypertension 3. Chronic history of smoking 4. Family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm   To summarize  Charles represents a typical demographic who can potentially develop an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The medical students should identify his risk factors and symptoms  pointing out the importance of considering abdominal aortic aneurysm in patients with such demographic data and presenting complaints  and the necessity of effective clinical and diagnostic investigations.                                                             
10,10,67,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial67,Case Study: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 72 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired mechanical engineer Residency: Urban Midwest  Past Medical History: The patient has a documented history of hypertension which is well-controlled with medication. He is also moderately overweight with a BMI of 28. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history but quit smoking ten years ago. Over the last few months  he has been showing high cholesterol levels. There is no history of diabetes or any other cardiovascular diseases.  Key Complaints: Mr. Johnson has come to the hospital with complaints of persistent and intermittent abdominal pain for the past three weeks. The pain is located around the umbilical region and often radiates to the lower back  but does not seem eating-related. He has also been feeling an unusual pulsating sensation in his abdomen. He describes the intensity as moderate to severe.   Additionally  he reported recent unintentional weight loss and decreased appetite. Mr. Johnson denies any changes in bowel habits  urinary symptoms  or any symptoms relating to his chest.  The patient has been feeling increasingly fatigued and notes that the pain often intensifies during physical activity. Intriguingly  he mentioned that he also feels the abdominal pain when he's lying flat  which momentarily eases upon sitting up.   To note  there has been no trauma or injury to the abdominal region  nor does Mr. Johnson recall any similar previous episodes. His last routine physical examination was approximately 6 months ago with no alarming findings.  This case requires a high degree of suspicion for an underlying Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  given the patient's age  gender  smoking history  hypertension status  and symptomatic presentation. An urgent comprehensive examination is in order to confirm this diagnosis and initiate appropriate management.
10,10,68,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial68,Patient Information:   Mr. A  a 72-year-old Caucasian male from rural areas  retired army officer  is brought to the emergency department by his son with the chief complaint of sudden onset severe abdominal and lower back pain for the past 4 hours.   His past medical history is notable for long-term smoking over 30 years (currently smoked at least a half pack per day)  uncontrolled hypertension  high cholesterol levels  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has no surgeries in the past. He is on antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medication as well as inhalers for his COPD but admits that he has not been compliant with his medications. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  his father died after suffering a cardiac arrest at the age of 60  and his older brother had a history of peripheral artery disease.  Present Complaint:  The pain is described as severe  10/10  and tearing in nature that started in his belly where he pointed to his belly button but has since moved to his lower back. The pain was sudden  didn’t radiate  and nothing makes it better or worse. He has also complained of generalized malaise  nausea  loss of appetite  and involuntary weight loss over the last month. There is no history of trauma  fever  chest pain  palpitations  cough  or urinary problems. He admits his abdomen has been growing larger in size over the last few months  but he thought it was related to his weight gain due to his decreased physical activity from COPD. There are no known drug allergies.   These symptoms raise suspicion for an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) given the sudden onset of severe abdominal and lower back pain  history of long-term smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol level  family history of cardiovascular disease  and the patient's age. The lack of trauma history and presence of generalized malaise  loss of appetite  and weight loss further increases the suspicion. Immediate medical attention and imaging studies are required at this point to confirm the presence of an AAA and assess its severity to manage it appropriately.

He is a long-time smoker  with a history of a 40-pack-years smoking. He lives with his wife  is independent in his activities of daily living  and generally maintains good health. His father had a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and died following a rupture at the age of 65.  Past Medical History: Mr. Robertson is previously diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is on medications including Amlodipine and Atorvastatin. His other past medical history includes appendectomy in his mid-20s and a broken arm in his late 60s. He has no known allergies. Mr. Robertson has refused annual ultrasound screening for AAA  despite having several risk factors.  Chief Complaints: He presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset  severe abdominal pain that started few hours ago. The pain is central and radiating to his back. He also reports feelings of faintness and anxiety. He denies having chest pain  palpitation or shortness of breath.  On examination  a pulsatile mass is noticed in the periumbilical area  which is tender on palpation. His blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg and pulse is 110/min.  Given his history and symptoms  an emergency ultrasound is ordered suspecting a ruptured AAA. The ultrasound reveals a 7.1 cm AAA indicating an impending rupture. The patient is immediately taken to the operation theatre for surgical intervention.   This case would be a beneficial study for medical students to understand the risk factors  symptoms  and immediate intervention required in the case of AAA  especially in patients who refuse routine screenings despite being at high risk.

10,10,72,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial72,"Case:  Demographics: Mr. Jackson  age 72  Caucasian male  retired construction worker  non-smoker  social drinker  BMI of 27  lives with wife  two children (now adults)  present a regular exercise regimen.  Past Medical History: Hypertension diagnosed at 60  hyperlipidemia diagnosed at 65  currently managed with medication. Both father and elder brother had a history of cardiovascular disease. No history of surgeries  allergies  or medications other than for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Jackson presents with complaints related to moderate to severe pain in the abdomen  particularly the middle and lower abdomen  which he describes as a """"pulsating sensation"""". His appetite has been negatively affected over the past week  leading to weight loss. He also reports feeling fatigued and occasional lightheadedness. He mentioned that the pain seems to get severe after meals and decreases while lying down.   The patient's pain severity and the pulsating nature of the discomfort raises suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAA should be considered in all older adults with abdominal pain or back pain  particularly those with risk factors such as advanced age  male sex  smoking  and a history of cardiovascular disease. If AAA is suspected  refer for emergency care to prevent rupture."
10,10,73,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial73,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Information: Name: John Doe Age: 68 Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired police officer  Medical History: John is an ex-smoker who quit 15 years ago after smoking a pack a day for 30 years. He has a known history of hypertension that is managed with a beta-blocker (Atenolol) and an ACE inhibitor (Lisinopril). He also has a history of high cholesterol which is controlled with a statin (Atorvastatin). John has a sedentary lifestyle and a family history of cardiovascular disease - his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and his older brother had a stroke at the age of 65.  Key Complaints: John came into the clinic for a routine medical check-up as he is experiencing some nonspecific complaints: He reports a feeling of fullness in his belly  vague abdominal discomfort  and occasional lower back pain for the past three months that haven't escalated but also haven't dissipated. These symptoms do not seem to relate to any specific trigger and haven't responded to over-the-counter pain killers. He also notes unintentional weight loss over the past 6 months. Vital signs are stable and he doesn’t display distress. He denies any sharp or radiating abdominal pain  pulsations in the abdomen  loss of consciousness  chest pain  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  constipation  dysuria  or hematuria. The patient also denies any calf pain or discoloration of his extremities.  Conclusion: Based on his age  sex  and family history of cardiovascular disease along with risk factors like cigarette smoking  hypertension  hypercholesteremia  and his symptoms  John should be evaluated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Physical examination to inspect the abdomen and palpate for an aneurysm should be conducted. Depending on the assessment  further ultrasound imaging might be required.

This patient's symptoms are vague but could indicate an aneurysm if correlated with the right elements from the patient's history and physical examination. These symptoms can be caused by slow growth and steady pressure on the wall of the aorta. The history of smoking  high blood pressure  and peripheral vascular disease increase the patient's risk. 
10,10,75,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial75,Case Report:  Patient Information:  John Doe  a 75-year-old Caucasian male.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of high blood pressure (hypertension) and hyperlipidemia. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. The patient has been treated for 10 years with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for his hypertension and a statin for hyperlipidemia.  Chief Complaint:  Mr. Doe presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset  severe 'tearing' pain in his lower back and abdomen that has persisted for the past three hours. He has noted an increase in intensity over the time. He has not had any similar episodes before. He also reports light-headedness and a rapid heartbeat but denies chest pain  shortness of breath  lower limb weakness or loss of consciousness. He also denies having any fever  recent infections  or trauma.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient appears anxious and distressed. His blood pressure is 160/80 mmHg in the right arm and 155/78 in the left  pulse rate is 110 bpm  and respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination reveals a pulsatile mass in the mid-epigastric area. The pain is reproduced on palpation of the mass. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  Please note that this training case is designed to provide medical students with an understanding of abdominal aortic aneurysm - its risk factors  presentation  examination findings  and the urgent need for referral and treatment.

10,10,76,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial76,Case Report:  Patient Presentation: Mr. Henry Thompson  a 72-year-old African American male  presents to the clinic for a routine check-up.  Demographics: Mr. Thompson is a retired school teacher who lives with his wife. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago but has a 40-pack year history. He only drinks alcohol occasionally in social settings.  Past Medical history: His past medical history is significant for hypertension  well controlled with medication (Losartan 50 mg once daily)  and moderately high cholesterol treated with Atorvastatin 20 mg once daily. He also has a longstanding history of obesity. He has no known drug allergies. He has no family history of cardiovascular disease.  Key Complaints: Mr. Thompson denies any current chest pain  shortness of breath  or exertional fatigue. However  he complains of a mild  nagging pain in the lower back that has been unremitting for the past couple of months. It feels like a dull ache and doesn't improve with rest or over-the-counter analgesics. He reports no associated weight loss  bowel or bladder changes  or traumatic injury.  He had noted a weird pulsating sensation in his abdomen occasionally but thought nothing more of it. He states he didn't report these symptoms earlier as he attributed it to his age and weight. The concern from his wife prompted him to mention it at this routine visit.  Summary: This case presents a geriatric man with a history of hypertension  high cholesterol  obesity and a significant smoking history. His main complaints are chronic lower back pain and a pulsating sensation in his abdomen. He denies any cardiovascular  respiratory  or urinary symptoms. Given his risk factors  there is a possible suspicion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). This case would challenge learners to consider a AAA in the differential diagnosis  prompting appropriate evaluation and management.

Hypertension – diagnosed 10 years ago  on antihypertensive medication 2. Smoking – 40 pack years history but quit around 5 years ago 3. Dyslipidemia - diagnosed 5 years ago  on lipid-lowering agents 4. No history of allergic reactions 5. No previous surgical history  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Doe presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe abdominal and lower back pain which he describes as tearing in nature. The pain  according to Mr. Doe  started a few hours ago  without any provocative event  and has progressively worsened. Mr. Doe also complains of feeling generally unwell and lightheaded. He denies any chest pain  loss of consciousness  or recent trauma. He has no complaint of fever  cough  urinary problem  changes in bowel habits or weight loss.  On further questioning  Mr. Doe reports that he has noticed a pulsating lump in his abdomen for the past few months but assumed it was just due to getting older and gaining weight. He denied any previous similar episodes of abdominal or back pain  radiating pain to the legs  or recent fever.  Family history is remarkable for cardiovascular diseases including an uncle who died of a """"heart rupture"""" in his early seventies.   Key learning objectives for this case would be to recognize the signs and symptoms of abdominal aortic aneurysm including risk factors  diagnostic approaches  and immediate management of the condition. The importance of rapidly managing pain and hemodynamic stabilization should be emphasized  as well as the need for immediate surgical consultation."
10,10,78,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial78,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Introduction: Mr. James Hopkins  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired school teacher  presents to the Emergency Department.   Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past ten years  which is fairly well controlled with medications (Lisinopril for hypertension and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia).   Smoking History:  He was a pack-a-day smoker for 30 years  but he quit smoking 15 years ago.   Social History:  He lives alone and denies any alcohol or illicit substance use.   Key Complaints: Mr. Hopkins complains of sudden-onset  severe lower back pain  described as a tearing sensation  which began 2 hours prior to presentation. The pain is non-radiating and has been continuous and impairing his ability to move. He also reports feeling somewhat light-headed but denies chest pain  shortness of breath  or loss of consciousness. He has not noticed any visible changes to his abdomen  such as swelling or color change.   Family History: His father died in his early 70s due to an unknown heart condition.   This patient's presentation is classical for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The medical history  particularly the history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and significant smoking history  all contribute to the suspected AAA. Its acute onset and severity are indicative of a potentially rupturing AAA  which would be a medical emergency. This case could provide an excellent opportunity for students to learn about the clinical presentation  risk factors  diagnosis  and management of AAA. It is essential for them to recognize this condition promptly and accurately because it is potentially life-threatening.
10,10,79,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial79,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics:  Name: Mr. John Barker Age: 72 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Engineer Marital Status: Married  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension controlled by medication (taking Lisinopril 20mg/daily) and hyperlipidemia managed with Atorvastatin 40mg/daily. He has a 45 pack-year smoking history but quit smoking 10 years ago. He also underwent angioplasty for coronary artery disease three years ago. Mr. Barker underwent a cholecystectomy in his 50's  but otherwise  there was no history of other serious diseases. No family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Barker presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset  severe abdominal pain that started approximately two hours ago. He describes the pain as non-radiating  constant  and located in the middle and lower abdomen. He has felt light-headed and has vomited once since the pain began. Further  he remarks a feeling of increased pulse near his belly button.   In this case  the student should focus on the patient's age  smoking history  and hypertension  which are significant risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain  an increased pulsatile feeling near the navel  and the hemodynamic instability might suggest a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The history of coronary artery disease hints towards generalized atherosclerosis which further adds to patient's risk of having an AAA.

The pain is 10/10 in severity  constant  beginning around his navel  and """"tearing"""" towards his lower back. He also noted a brief period of dizziness and cold sweating but denies any chest pain or shortness of breath. He characterizes his pain as the worst he has ever experienced.  On further enquiry  he also admits to recent unintended weight loss and early satiety over the past six months but did not seek medical attention because he attributed these symptoms to his age and stress.  This case report provides a comprehensive history of a patient with multiple risk factors for developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm including age  family history of cardiovascular diseases  smoking  hypertension  high cholesterol  and diabetes. It also presents a typical presentation of a possibly ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm with sudden onset severe abdominal pain  subjective weight loss  and early satiety. This case will aid in introducing the medical students to the complexities of diagnosing and managing an abdominal aortic aneurysm."

10,10,83,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial83,Patient Information: J.D. is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired truck driver  hailing from the suburbs of Boston  Massachusetts.  Past Medical History: - Diagnosed with hypertension eight years ago. - Became a regular smoker at age 20 and quit at age 64. - Periodic bouts of mild lower back pain for the past few years. - His father died due to aortic aneurysm at age 70  and his primary care provider has been monitoring him for signs of the same disease.  Key Complaints: - One week of persisting abdominal pain  slightly lower than the belly button  described as a deep  pulsating feeling. - The pain seems to intensify while lying down. - He has experienced intermittent episodes of sharp  severe  tearing pain in the middle of his abdomen and lower back. - There is a reported light-headedness and difficulty standing upright without support  indicating potential hypotensive episodes. - No accompanying complaints of fever  weight loss  loss of appetite  or change in bowel habits.  Possible other nonspecific or related complaints for an advanced stage or rupture may include clammy skin  rapid heart rate  nausea  vomiting  or shock.   Clinical Decision Making: The combination of age  sex  background  family history  smoking  hypertension  and the nature of pain suggests a diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Physical examination may reveal an abdominal mass that pulses with the heartbeat. Diagnostic tests  e.g.  ultrasound  CT Scan  or MRI  and immediate surgical consultation will be required. The case thus can be used to teach students about AAA pathophysiology  risk factors  clinical presentation  diagnosis  and management.
10,10,84,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial84,Case Report  Patient Demographics Mr. Daniel Brown  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker presented to the emergency department of our hospital.  Past Medical History Mr. Brown has been diagnosed with Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia ten years ago  controlled by medication. He has a ten-year history of tobacco use but quit five years ago. He has no history of surgical interventions. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died from myocardial infarction at the age of 60.  Key Complaints Mr. Brown presented with a sudden severe abdominal pain radiating to the back  associated with nausea. He reported the pain as tearing and constant. He denied chest pain  lower limb weakness  or any recent trauma.   This case should lead students to suspect an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). In this case  the patient's history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  and family history of cardiovascular disease are significant risk factors. The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain radiating to the back is definitive of AAA. Once students establish a differential diagnosis that includes AAA  they should be instructed to next steps including confirmatory diagnostic tests and emergency management of a potentially ruptured AAA.

He reports unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds over the past 4 months which he attributed to loss of appetite. He also reports some difficulty in walking  which he attributes to """"old age"""".  Over the past week  the intensity of the pain has increased  prompting him to seek medical attention. He expressed a fear that these symptoms could be related to his heart  as his father died of a heart attack at the age of 70.   The intent of this case study is to help medical students apply their theoretical knowledge of cardiovascular diseases  namely abdominal aortic aneurysm. It encourages in-depth examination  review of patient's history and risk factors (such as hypertension  smoking  age  family history)  correct diagnosis through physical and laboratory tests  and appropriate management of the condition."
10,10,86,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial86,Patient Details:  Name: John Doe Age: 71 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer Marital Status: Married  Past Medical History: - Hypertension diagnosis confirmed 12 years ago  being managed by oral medication - Previous smoker for 45 years  quit 6 years ago - History of high cholesterol - No known allergies - No family history of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) - No previous surgeries  Key Complaints: - The patient presents with sudden severe  sharp  and persistent pain in the lower back and abdomen. - The pain started approximately four hours prior to patient's visit  according to the patient  it was not linked to any specific event or physical trauma. - Accompanying symptoms include fainting episodes  rapid pulse  sweating  and nausea. - Patient describes pain as 8 on the scale of 10  not relieved by rest or change of position. - No known allergies  Proposed Case: Mr. John Doe  a 71-year-old retired engineer with a past medical history significant for hypertension and high cholesterol  came to the emergency department complaining of sudden and severe abdominal and back pain persisting for four hours. Upon further questioning  Mr. Doe mentioned fainting  sweating  rapid pulse  and nausea during this period. The patient was a long-time smoker  but quit 6 years ago. He does not have a family history of AAA  and his discomfort is not relieved by rest or change of position. The history and presentation of symptoms suggest a potential diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
10,10,87,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial87,Patient Information:  Mr. James Collins  65-year-old Caucasian Male  retired engineer. Non-smoker  moderate alcohol consumer.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Collins has a long-standing history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  managed by antihypertensive medications (ACE inhibitors) and statins respectively. He was diagnosed with early-stage COPD 3 years ago. Family history reveals that his father died of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at age 68.   Key complaints:  Mr. Collins presents to the clinic with constant  severe pain in his lower back and abdominal region  dissimilar to anything he has previously experienced. He described the pain as deep  throbbing  and unrelieved by position change. He also mentions occasional lightheadedness over the past week but denies any experience of syncope  palpitations  or chest pain. On further inquiry  mild unexplained weight loss over the past month is identified.  Physical Examination:  On examination  he appears in acute pain. An abdominal exam discovered a pulsatile mass in his mid-abdominal region slightly left of midline. No signs of abdominal distension  guarding  or rebound tenderness were observed. His blood pressure reading is high  around 155/90 mmHg  and pulse rate is around 90 beats per minute  regular.   Investigations: His description of symptoms and clinical findings leads us to suspect an abdominal aortic aneurysm. An immediate abdominal ultrasound followed by a CT scan if an aneurysm is found is suggested. Blood tests including full blood count  kidney function tests  and coagulation profile are also proposed.   Plan:  If the aneurysm is confirmed and measures over 5.5 cm  or if Mr. Collins displays symptoms suggestive of impending rupture  immediate surgical intervention will be required. Parallelly  close monitoring of his hypertension would be paramount. Mr. Collins also needs to be counseled on lifestyle changes  especially dietary modifications and increased physical activity to manage his risks.  This case is valuable for students to understand the presentation  risk factors  assessment  and management of abdominal aortic aneurysms in the clinical setting. It also brings awareness of the importance of familial history in the context of aneurysms.
10,10,88,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial88,Case Report:   Patient Demographics:  Patient is a 68-year old Caucasian male.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for about 40 years but quit 10 years ago  and has a moderate alcohol intake.  Key Complaints:  The patient presented to the clinic with a vague  uncomfortable feeling in his lower abdominal area. He reported occasional low back pain and unexplained weight loss. The patient has noticed that he feels the pain especially after meals  walking  and other physical activities. He also mentioned that the pain seems to decrease when laying flat.  The patient further notes that he is currently not taking his blood pressure medication due to financial issues  and the recently deployed blood pressure measurements suggest moderately high readings. Despite past attempts to manage his cholesterol through diet  he has struggled to maintain a low-fat diet.   Please Note:   Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) often doesn't show symptoms unless it's close to rupturing. However  the nature of the patient’s complaints—pain in the abdominal and lower back area  unexplained weight loss  and high-risk factors such as age  smoking history  and hypertension—may point towards AAA  which should be evaluated further. AAA’s should be suspected in older patients with risk factors and new onset  unexplained abdominal or lower back pain. Rapid diagnosis and referral to a vascular surgeon are crucial.   Remaining aware of risk factors and keeping AAA on the differential diagnosis list can aid early detection and prevent catastrophic outcomes. Surgical treatment for AAA is effective  but postoperative care can be challenging with patients often needing intensive care post-surgery. 
10,10,89,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial89,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Name: R.M. Gender: Male Age: 71 Occupation: Retired mechanical engineer Ethnicity: Caucasian  Smoking History: 40 pack-years  Past Medical History: R.M. has a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with his tobacco use. Confirmation of R.M.'s COPD diagnosis was made 7 years ago with spirometry. He manages his hypertension and hyperlipidemia with amlodipine and rosuvastatin  respectively. However  patient admits to non-adherence in medication usage. R.M has no history of any previous surgical procedure.   Key Complaints: R.M. presents with a several months' history of intermittent abdominal and back pain  which he initially attributed to 'old age' and 'stress'. He also complained of unintentional weight loss and decreased appetite over the same time frame. Over the past week  R.M. noticed the pain has become more severe  constituting a sharp  tearing sensation in his lower back and abdomen. Additionally  he now feels occasional pulsations in his abdomen and has grown more concerned. He has had no changes in bowel or bladder function.  Family History: R.M.'s father died from heart disease at 75 and his mother had a stroke in her 70's. His brother had an abdominal aortic aneurysm that was operated on in his 60s.  Remarks: Given R.M.'s age  gender  smoking history  and family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm  he's at an increased risk for developing such condition. His complaints of persistent  severe pain  along with the noticeable pulsations in his abdomen  are alarming symptoms that call for immediate ultrasound imaging to confirm or rule out an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Its objectives are to understand the pathophysiology of an AAA  appreciate the importance of early detection and intervention  and to familiarize the students  with the management and prognosis of AAA.
10,10,92,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial92,Case Report: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  Patient Demographics: Mr. John Doe  a 70-year-old Caucasian male of slightly overweight build. He is a retired naval officer  currently living with his wife  and is an active smoker for 50 years and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has no known drug allergies.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a known history of hypertension for ten years which he controls with daily metoprolol. His other significant medical history includes high cholesterol controlled with statins and a minor heart attack five years ago. Importantly  Mr. Doe also has a family history of cardiovascular disorders  as his father passed away at the age of 75 due to a massive heart attack and his elder brother  aged 72  was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) last year.  Key Complaints: The patient presented in the outpatient department reporting continuing episodes of severe abdominal pain  centered in his lower back  that comes and goes for the past two weeks but has progressively worsened. He describes it as a sharp  tearing sensation. He also mentioned episodes of lightheadedness but no palpitations  chest pain  or dyspnea. On further probing  he reported feeling a pulsating mass near his navel while lying down. Mr. Doe had no changes in bowel movements  urinary habits  or significant weight loss.  Given his family history  the fluctuating pattern of abdominal and back pain  and the presence of a pulsatile mass  these could all indicate the presence of AAA. Prompt evaluation with imaging  normally ultrasound or CT angiography  should be performed for definitive diagnosis and assessment of AAA.
10,10,93,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial93,Patient Information: Mr. Edward Black  Male  72 years old  Caucasian. Retired engineer  smoker for 50 years  social drinker. From New York City. No known drug allergies.    Past Medical History: Record shows a history of hypertension managed with lisinopril for 20 years and high cholesterol levels managed with atorvastatin for the last 15 years. Diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  managed with metformin. No history of surgeries or major illnesses. No record of similar problems in the family. Followed vaccination schedule and no travel history in the past year. Regularly visits his primary care physician every six months for check-ups.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Black presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset severe pain in the middle and lower part of his abdomen and lower back that started around two hours ago. The pain was sudden in onset and has progressively worsened. He described it as a tearing sensation. He also feels dizzy and sweaty  but denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations. He mentions having had episodes of sharp  intermittent  lower abdominal pain for the past 3 months  which he thought was indigestion and treated with over-the-counter antacids. No weight loss  change in appetite  nausea  vomiting  alterations in bowel or bladder habits  or any other associated symptoms.   Given the patient's age  history of hypertension  high cholesterol  and long-term smoking habit  along with his current symptoms  an abdominal aortic aneurysm could be the possible cause of his abdominal and back pain  warranting immediate attention and thorough investigation  such as a computed tomography (CT) scan. Additionally  other differential diagnoses that must be ruled out include renal colic  diverticulosis  and acute pancreatitis.  Through this case  medical students should recognize the importance of obtaining a thorough history and performing a detailed physical examination  which are crucial steps in diagnosing acute abdominal conditions like an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Students should also understand the importance of recognizing the risk factors and clinical presentations for an abdominal aortic aneurysm  which can be a life-threatening condition if not treated promptly.
10,10,94,diagnosis10-prompt10-trial94,Patient Information:   Gender: Male Age: 65 years old Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Construction Worker  Past Medical History:   The patient has a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol  for which he takes medication regularly. He is a former smoker  who quit 15 years ago after a 30-year  one pack/day habit. His father died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture at the age of 75.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presents to the outpatient department with a 3-day history of intermittent  dull abdominal pain. He reports the pain to be 6/10 on the pain scale  which seems to be concentrated in the central and lower abdomen and not associated with food intake. There is no radiation of the pain. He denies any back pain  change in bowel or urinary habits  but has noted vague discomfort in his lower abdomen. He has not noticed any pulsating masses in his abdomen. He has also experienced random episodes of lightheadedness and fatigue.  This case could lead on to teaching points on the risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). For instance  hypertension  high cholesterol  family history  smoking  and increased age  all of which the patient has. It should be explained that AAA often presents with nonspecific or no symptoms. However  symptomatic aneurysms might present with abdominal or back pain. An incidental finding of a pulsatile abdominal mass on examination or using diagnostic ultrasound imaging fortifies the potential AAA diagnosis.   The management of AAA depends on the size and rate of growth  and could include watchful waiting  medical management to slow the growth  or surgical intervention which can be minimally invasive (endovascular) or open surgery. Emphasis should be on the potential fatal complication of AAA rupture that underlines the importance of early identification and management of the condition.
