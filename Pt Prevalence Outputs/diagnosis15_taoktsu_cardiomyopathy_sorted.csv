15,1,3,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial3,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  named Mrs. Smith  who presented at the emergency department with acute chest pain radiating to her left arm  reminiscent of her earlier myocardial infarction three years ago. The symptoms began suddenly a couple of hours after she received an unexpected distressing phone call from her recently estranged daughter. Associated symptoms include diaphoresis  nausea  and dyspnea  but she denies symptoms related to fevers  chills  cough  or palpitations.  Mrs. Smith's past medical history involves Stage III ovarian cancer diagnosed five years ago but has been in remission post-chemotherapy and surgery. She also has a history of hypertension and had a myocardial infarction three years ago  which was managed conservatively. She has been compliant with her atenolol and lisinopril regimens for hypertension and aspirin and statins for heart disease. Post her myocardial infarction  she had asymptomatic stable angina on exertion  which is being currently managed with a nitroglycerin patch. She did not report non-compliance or changes to these medications.   She is a retired school teacher  now living with her husband  who is supportive. She quit smoking after her heart disease diagnosis three years ago and has no known drug allergies. She admits to occasional social alcohol use and has no history of recreational drug use.  In summary  this aging Caucasian female with a history of hypertension  ischemic heart disease  and ovarian cancer is now presenting with an acute-onset chest pain after a shocking emotional event. Given her symptoms and history  it seems like a case of acute coronary syndrome. However  considering her recent emotional stress  potential Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) should also be considered. Regardless of the final diagnosis  prompt evaluation and management are key to prevent morbidity or potential mortality.
15,1,4,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial4,"Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographic Information:  Name: Ms. Smith Age: 66 Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher  Past Medical History:  Ms. Smith has a past medical history significant for well-controlled hypertension for which she takes daily medication. She has no history of surgical admissions. She is non-diabetic and non-asthmatic. There is no history of chronic heart failure  coronary artery disease  or other significant cardiac conditions. She was treated for breast cancer ten years ago and has been in remission since finishing treatment. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally in a social setting. She exercises regularly and maintains a balanced diet  and there is no known history of drug abuse. She lives alone and has no known allergies. There is a family history of cardiac disease  with her father dying from heart disease at the age of 70.  Recent Medical Issue:  Ms. Smith presented at the emergency department with severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations. Her symptoms started suddenly after she was exposed to an intense emotional stressor. Despite the symptoms and primary observation indicative of an acute myocardial infarction  the coronary angiography was clear. There was  however  significant left ventricular dysfunction. Additionally  her EKG showed ST-segment elevation  but her troponin level was only slightly above normal. After proper medical investigation  including echocardiography  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""".  Management:  Immediate treatment would parallel that of an acute coronary syndrome until this can be ruled out. Once diagnosed  her management is based largely on expert consensus and experience. The plan for care includes relieving the emotional stress  monitoring vital parameters  and prescribing beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. As takotsubo cardiomyopathy is usually reversible  the expectation is that Ms. Smith's heart will recover its normal function within a few weeks  requiring close follow-ups and monitoring to ensure progression towards recovery.  Conclusion:  Stress cardiomyopathy or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a temporary heart condition that is often brought on by stressful situations  like the death of a loved one. It's critical to thoroughly evaluate such patients  as early identification and treatment can significantly improve patient prognosis. "
15,1,5,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial5,Patient Presentation:  Today we are discussing the case of Mrs. E  a 68-year-old African-American female with a past medical history significant for hypertension  well controlled on lisinopril for the past 10 years  and hypothyroidism  treated with levothyroxine. She is a non-smoker  drinks alcohol occasionally and denies any illicit drug use. She was recently widowed six months ago and reports a past history of anxiety disorder but chose not to take regular medication.   Presenting Symptoms:  Mrs. E presented to the emergency room with chest pain  described as severe 'crushing' sensation  accompanied by shortness of breath that started a few hours prior to presentation. She also reports feeling lightheaded on occasion. The symptoms did not subside with rest.   Clinical Examination:  On examination  Mrs. E appeared distressed. Her blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg  pulse was 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation level was 95% on room air. Chest auscultation revealed normal breath sounds bilaterally  and her heart sound revealed a regular rhythm but tachycardic. No audible murmurs  rubs  or gallops were noted.   Provisional Diagnosis:  Given her symptoms and physical exam findings  the circumstantial stressful life event  and EKG changes  suggested of ST elevation in the precordial leads  a provisional diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome'  was made.  This condition typically presents with symptoms mirroring those of an acute myocardial infarction  but without associated coronary artery occlusion. It is frequently associated with acute emotional or physical stress. In the case of Mrs. E  this may be linked to the recent loss of her spouse.   The patient was admitted for further management including echocardiogram and possibly cardiac catheterization to confirm the diagnosis. Overall  prognosis is often positive with the right medical management and stress control  but it takes time for the heart to fully recover.
15,1,6,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial6,"Patient Presentation   The patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian female named Mrs. Julia Brown. She works as a retired teacher living with her daughter  son-in-law  and grandson. Mrs. Brown's past medical history is significant for hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and type-2 diabetes mellitus; all of which are well-controlled with medication. She has a 20-pack-year smoking history and quit smoking 15 years ago. She has a family history of cardiovascular disease; her father had a myocardial infarction at age 65.  Mrs. Brown presents to the emergency room with severe central chest pain described as a heavy crushing feeling associated with shortness of breath. The pain started suddenly this morning and has remained persistent since. It worsens with activity and partially relieves with rest.  Over the last month  her life has been stressful. She lost her elder sister to cancer and has been managing the majority of the funeral affairs. She had a previous episode of chest discomfort a year ago  during a very stressful time at work  which disappeared after her retirement  thus was not investigated further.  Given her symptoms  medical history  and recent emotional stress  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" is under consideration. Further investigations including ECG  cardiac enzymes  and echo-cardiogram are ongoing to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of her cardiac dysfunction."
15,1,7,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial7,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Maria Gonzalez  a 64-year-old Hispanic female  presents today with acute onset chest pain  shortness of breath and fatigue. She is a retired school teacher  a non-smoker with an occasional alcohol consumption. She questioned whether these symptoms are related to stress  as her husband passed away just four weeks prior.   Past medical history reveals she is hypertensive  diagnosed at the age of 48 years  well controlled on Amlodipine 5mg daily. She has no other cardiac history  normal lipid profile  and no known family history of heart disease. Both her parents are alive and well in their late 80s.   Upon physical examination  she seems visibly distressed  with a blood pressure of 142/86 mmHg  heart rate 105 beats/minute  and respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute. She has slightly elevated jugular venous pressure. Auscultation reveals normal breath sounds and no abnormal heart sounds. Her neurological examination is unremarkable.  An EKG shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads and cardiac enzymes are elevated. Based on these clinical findings  and taking into account her recent emotional trauma  a possible diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or “broken heart syndrome”  was considered.   Further diagnostic tests including echocardiography and coronary angiography are arranged to confirm our diagnosis  while she is being managed with conservative measures in the cardiac care unit.   This case demonstrates the intriguing entity of stress cardiomyopathy  a transient left ventricular dysfunction mimicking an acute coronary syndrome  in a patient facing acute emotional stress.
15,1,8,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial8,Patient Profile:  Demographics: Name: Mrs. Helen Johnson Age: 63  Gender: Female Occupation: Retired school teacher Nationality: Caucasian American Address: 456 Hilltop Street  Bronx  New York City  USA Marital Status: Widowed No. of Children: 3 (all adults)  Medical History: Mrs. Johnson has a previously recorded history of hypertension  that was diagnosed approximately 10 years ago  which is fairly well-controlled with medication. She has no personal or family history of heart disease or diabetes. In addition  she had her menopause at 51 years old. She recently underwent total knee arthroplasty owing to severe arthritic pain. Mrs. Johnson is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol. Her sexual history is non-promiscuous; she had been together with her husband for the past 40 years until his demise 3 months ago.   Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Johnson was brought to the emergency department with acute chest pain that started a few hours back. She reported that the pain initiated suddenly and has been persistent since. No relation with physical exercise or meals. Accompanying symptoms included shortness of breath  light-headedness  and profuse perspiration.   On further probing  it was found that Mrs. Johnson had been under enormous stress due to her husband’s recent death  suggesting an emotional trigger for the current episode. Especially her symptoms were similar to myocardial infarction. These raised the suspicion for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which was confirmed by subsequent diagnostic tests including electrocardiogram (ECG)  echocardiogram  and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).   Treatment plan and post-discharge follow-up have been scheduled for her  with the prognosis being generally positive since complete recovery is generally expected in takotsubo cardiomyopathy  but close monitoring and emotional support are advised for her condition.
15,1,9,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial9,"Patient Profile: Our patient is a 63-year-old  Caucasian woman named Sarah  who presents to our office with symptoms suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   History of Present Illness: Sarah recently experienced a severe emotional stress event - the unexpected death of her husband. She began experiencing symptoms such as severe chest pain and shortness of breath approximately 48 hours following the tragic incident. The symptoms are consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" a sudden and acute form of heart failure.  Past Medical History: Sarah has been relatively healthy throughout her life. She has a known history of hypertension which is managed through diet and exercise  and a brief bout with depression 15 years ago. She does not smoke  drink alcohol  or have any known drug allergies. Sarah is not on any regular medications but occasionally takes over-the-counter pain relief for osteoarthritis. Her mother had a cardiovascular disease history - ischemic heart disease  and her father was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.  Family History:  A family history of heart disease is present on the maternal side of Sarah's family. Her mother's cardiovascular disease suggests a possible familial risk. Her father had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.  Social History: Sarah is a retired teacher  a widow who lives with her adult son. She has never smoked or taken illicit drugs and is a social drinker with alcohol consumption limited to 2-3 glasses of red wine per week.  Clinical Presentation: Sarah's symptoms are indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and would warrant further investigations such as ECG  echocardiogram  blood tests to assess cardiac enzymes  and possibly a coronary angiogram. This would be necessary to differentiate the condition from a heart attack and support the primary diagnosis. Management of her condition would involve addressing the acute symptoms  along with a referral for psychological support to help her cope with the emotional stress of her husband's death.   In summary  Sarah is undergoing a significant emotional event  and her symptomatology is supporting the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. With her past medical history and recent emotional stress  she is presenting a typical case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy."

15,1,11,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial11,Patient Presentation  Name: Mrs. E. Smith Age: 65-year-old Gender: Female  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired school teacher  Chief complaint: Chest discomfort and shortness of breath.  Patient Mrs. E. Smith  presents with a sudden onset of chest pain and difficulty breathing over the last few hours. She states that the chest pain is severe and is mimicking the symptoms of a heart attack like tightness  heaviness  and radiating pain to her left arm. She describes her fatigue and palpitations as overwhelming and occurring out of nowhere.  Historical information reveals that Mrs. E. Smith has been under considerable emotional stress since her husband passed away three months ago. She has no previous history of heart disease  diabetes  hypertension  or any other chronic illness. She does not smoke  drink alcohol  or use recreational drugs.  A few weeks prior  she was seen in the office for anxiety and insomnia  at which time a basic physical exam and routine blood work were normal. Family history is significant for stroke in her mother  but no known heart diseases.  Given the severe chest pain  elevated cardiac enzymes  and ST-segment elevation on the ECG  along with her recent severe emotional stress  a presumptive diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or “broken heart syndrome ” is made.   The patient was immediately admitted to the Cardiology ward for further management and monitoring. Thanks for sharing this case. It is a good reminder that extreme emotional stress can lead to significant physical health problems  such as takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
15,1,12,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial12,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Information:  Mrs. Maria Gonzalez  a 65-year-old Hispanic female  presents with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome.   Past Medical History:  Mrs. Gonzalez has a past medical history that includes moderate hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been well-controlled with medication. Mrs. Gonzalez leads a fairly sedentary lifestyle due to her retired status and she mentions occasional sessions of light yoga. She also has an extensive history of tobacco use with a quit date 10 years ago. She has no known allergies. Family history is significant for cardiovascular disease in multiple first-degree relatives.   Presenting Symptoms and Diagnosis: Mrs. Gonzalez recently experienced the sudden death of her husband  following which she developed chest pain and shortness of breath  prompting her to seek medical assessment. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation consistent with myocardial infarction. However  a subsequent coronary angiogram found no significant blockages  ruling out coronary artery disease.  On further examination  an echocardiogram showed reduced ejection fraction and an abnormal motion of the left ventricle  with ballooning and poor contraction of the ventricular apex. These findings  along with transient left ventricular dysfunction  are suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress.  Treatment Plan: The treatment plan comprises the management of symptoms and the underlying stressor. Heart failure medications including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors were started. Given the significant emotional stressor  bereavement counseling and potential psychological therapy were also recommended to help manage emotional stress contributing to her condition.   Follow-up plans include regular monitoring with echocardiograms to assess restoration of normal cardiac function and adjustment of her therapeutic regimen to ensure optimal response.   In conclusion  Mrs. Gonzalez's case highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis when patients present with symptoms mimicking a heart attack  particularly post-menopausal women with a recent history of severe emotional stress.
15,1,13,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial13,"Title: Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Middle-aged Female  Patient Presentation:  The patient we are studying today is a 58-year-old Caucasian female  Mrs. Jane Smith. She has presented with chest pain and shortness of breath that started suddenly yesterday evening. She reports experiencing a severe emotional stress: her husband of 30 years passed away four days ago. According to the history provided  she doesn't have any known drug allergies  and her family history is non-contributory.   Past Medical History:  Mrs. Smith's past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension for which she has been taking Amlodipine (5mg) for around three years. She also has a history of moderate  episodic major depressive disorder for which she has been getting psychiatric help and medication (Fluoxetine) for the past decade.  Current Presentation:  Now  Mrs. Smith presents with acute symptoms resembling myocardial infarction  including chest pains and shortness of breath. However  upon further testing  preliminary blood tests and ECG findings were found inconsistent with myocardial infarction. Gold-standard coronary angiography and left ventriculogram revealed the characteristic apical ballooning appearance with hyperkinesis of the basal walls of the heart  in absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.  Diagnosis:  These findings supported the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or stress-induced cardiomyopathy. This condition often occurs in post-menopausal women following a significant physical or emotional stress event and is characterised by transient systolic dysfunction of the apical and/or mid segments of the left ventricle. This creates a """"takotsubo"""" appearance - a term derived from the Japanese word for """"octopus pot """" referencing the distinctive shape.  This case underscores the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chest pain  particularly in the context of significant emotional stress and in absence of classic coronary artery disease risk factors or inconsistency in clinical and investigational findings for acute coronary syndrome."
15,1,14,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial14,Subject: Patient Presentation - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:   - Name: Ms. Suzanne Harris - Age: 67  - Sex: Female - Race: Caucasian - Marital Status: Divorced - Occupation: Retired School Teacher  Chief Complaint:   Ms. Harris presents with a sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain is described as severe and radiates to the back  lasting for around two hours.  Medical History:   - Hypertension: Diagnosed 10 years ago  on Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) - Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed 5 years ago  on statin therapy - Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 3 years ago  controlled with metformin - No previous history of cardiac diseases - No known allergies  Lifestyle Factors:   - Non-smoker - Moderate alcohol consumption - Sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity  Socioeconomic Factors:  Ms. Harris lives alone and has recently been dealing with the death of her pet  which she discloses has left her feeling extremely stressed and upset.  Presenting Illness:  Upon examination  Ms. Harris showed classic signs of acute myocardial infarction. However  subsequent tests including ECG and blood tests showed no evidence of coronary artery disease  which typically causes myocardial infarction. After further investigation  including coronary angiogram and echocardiogram  it was found that Ms. Harris had apical ballooning  a distinctive form of left ventricular dysfunction  suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  typically presents like a heart attack. Emotional stress could be a trigger  as might be the case with Ms. Harris. It's crucial to manage her stress level  given that it can potentially exacerbate the condition. The working diagnosis for Ms. Harris  considering her symptoms and test results  is takotsubo cardiomyopathy. A psychiatry consult may also be warranted to support her mental health.   The next step in management will include beta blockers and follow-up echocardiograms to evaluate the progress of her heart function. Additionally  a lifestyle modification plan which includes regular physical activity and dietary changes may help manage her other health conditions.   Finally  acknowledging Ms. Harris's grief over her pet's death is vital  as takotsubo cardiomyopathy often stems from intense emotional stress. Psychological and emotional therapy  in addition to medication  can play a significant role in recovery.
15,1,15,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial15,"Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: Mrs. Linda Johnson  a 72-year-old caucasian female.  Chief Complaint: She presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started abruptly following a heated argument with a family member this morning.  Past Medical History: She has a history of Hypertension for the past 10 years  is under medication with Lisinopril. She's got excellent blood pressure control. She is non-diabetic and does not smoke. She has no known drug allergies but has a documented history of penicillin allergy.  Recent History: The patient recently underwent significant life stressors. She lost her husband six months ago and since then she has been living alone  with occasional visits from family members. She has been experiencing episodes of anxiety and mood swings  but never sought any treatment for the same.  Presentation: On examination  she appeared acutely distressed  sweaty  and pale. Her blood pressure was elevated at 170/100mmHg. She described her chest pain analogous to """"an elephant sitting on her chest"""".   Investigations: ECG showed ST-segment elevation without any previous ECG for comparison. Blood tests indicated a slightly elevated troponin level. An echocardiogram revealed left ventricular apical ballooning with a preserved basal function  consistent with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or stress-induced cardiomyopathy.  In short  Mrs. Johnson is a 72 year old female with a history of controlled hypertension  presenting with chest pain and elevated troponin levels  with the clinical image of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Due to the stressful triggers and the clinical presentation  the diagnosis points towards Takotsubo (stress-induced) Cardiomyopathy also known as """"broken heart syndrome."""" Our primary focus will be on containing her symptoms  trying to manage her hypertension  and addressing her underlying causes of stress which seems to be the precipitating factor."
15,1,16,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial16,Subject: Patient Presentation - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  I. Introduction Today  we present a case of a 63-year-old African-American female patient currently diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as Broken heart syndrome. The patient was admitted complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath.  II. Demographics The patient is a retired schoolteacher living in Boston  Massachusetts. She is a widow with two adult children and three grandchildren. She is non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. No known drug allergies have been reported.   III. Past Medical History The patient's medical history is remarkable with controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which she is on a long-term medicinal regimen. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a decade ago  which has been under control through dietary measures and medication.   IV. Recent History The patient’s husband passed away two years ago  she mentioned suffering from bouts of intense anxiety and emotional stress since his passing. The weeks leading up to her admission were notably stressful due to the first death anniversary of her husband.   V. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Diagnosis The patient presented with severe chest pain and shortness of breath  resembling symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction. However  after laboratory tests and imaging procedures including ECG  blood tests  and coronary angiogram  the initial suspicion of a heart attack was ruled out. Her left ventriculogram showed a classic apical ballooning indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   VI. Conclusion The patient is currently stable and responding well to heart failure medications. She will continue with her hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes medications. Given the suspected emotional triggers of her condition  she has been referred for grief counseling to help cope with her emotional stressors and potentially mitigate the chances of a recurrence. This case emphasizes the potential heart impacts of severe emotional stress  particularly in individuals with existing cardiovascular risk factors.
15,1,17,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial17,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female named Mrs. Millie Walker. She is a retired high school principal and currently living alone in Florida. Her health history includes controlled hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  both of which are managed through medications. She presents to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain accompanied by difficulty in breathing.  The chest pain was first experienced this morning when she heard the news of her son being involved in a car accident. The pain was described as “crushing” and was not related to any physical activity. Thankfully  her son is now in stable condition  but she states that she has not been able to overcome the stress.   Mrs. Walker is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She denies any illicit drug use. The only known allergies she has listed are Penicillins that give her hives. She is adherent to her treatment regimen for hypertension and diabetes which includes Lisinopril and Metformin respectively.   On initial assessment  her vital signs are stable except for mild tachycardia. On physical examination there is no evident peripheral edema  jugular venous distension or abnormal lung sounds. The ECG done reveals ST-segment elevation  which is usually seen in patients with an acute myocardial infarction  but her troponin level  though elevated  appears lower than typically seen in myocardial infarction patients.  On further performing echocardiography and coronary angiogram  the classical pattern of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (resembling the shape of an octopus trap) is observed with apical ballooning and hyperkinesis of the basal walls. The angiogram shows no significant coronary artery disease that would explain the regional wall motion abnormalities seen on the echocardiogram.   Given her recent severe emotional stress  the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as Broken Heart Syndrome) is made.   This presentation aligns with the typical demographic of patients who develop takotsubo cardiomyopathy -- postmenopausal women who have recently experienced severe emotional stress. The case will be important for therapeutic stress management and cardiovascular support.
15,1,18,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial18,"Patient Presentation:  We have Ms. Miyazaki  a 68-year-old Japanese female. She is a retired school educator with an unremarkable medical history  who was relatively active and healthy prior to the current episode. She is a nonsmoker with no known drug allergies. She denies alcohol or substance abuse. There is no known family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Three days ago  Ms. Miyazaki experienced the sudden death of her husband. Shortly after  she was brought to emergency care presenting with severe chest pain accompanied by shortness of breath  palpitations  and profuse sweating. The symptoms were initially interpreted as those of acute myocardial infarction due to their presentation.  Clinical evaluation revealed slightly raised troponin levels  with other cardiac enzyme studies being within normal limits. An EKG exhibited ST-segment elevation. However  a coronary angiography was suggestive of non-obstructive coronary arteries  ruling out the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction.  The ventriculogram showed apical ballooning with preserved basal function  leading to the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This was later confirmed through an echocardiogram.   Ms. Miyazaki's emotional stress due to the loss of her husband  along with her presenting symptoms  classic ventricular changes  and absence of obstructive coronary disease  are all suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (or """"broken heart syndrome"""").  In conclusion  I present a case of stress-inducible (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy in a post-menopausal woman with no significant past medical history  precipitated by intense emotional stress from bereavement. This case highlights the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in post-menopausal women presenting with symptoms mimicking an acute coronary syndrome  especially under stress."

Recent History:  A week ago  Mrs. Sanchez’s husband was diagnosed with lung cancer. Her own symptoms started abruptly this morning after a particularly stressful discussion about her husband’s illness  its prognosis and the potential burdens of extensive chemotherapy.   On examination  she has an elevated heart rate  but her blood pressure is well-controlled. Her ECG shows abnormalities that mimic those seen in acute myocardial infarction. However  preliminary lab studies reveal negative cardiac markers.  After more extensive testing  she is diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken-heart"""" syndrome. This condition commonly follows severe emotional stress and was likely precipitated by the recent emotional discussions regarding her husband’s new cancer diagnosis.   She will require close observation and management  including supportive measures and probably beta-blocker therapy. She would also benefit from emotional and psychological support to help her cope with the stressful circumstances that appear to have precipitated this condition."
15,1,20,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial20,Patient Presentation:  Today  I would like to present Mrs. Garcia  a 57-year-old Hispanic female who presents with symptoms suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome.   Mrs. Garcia was born and raised in Texas  where she currently resides. She is a retired middle school teacher and lives alone ever since her husband passed away last month unexpectedly. Her substantial emotional stress since her husband's death may have precipitated her present condition.  Her past medical history is significant for obesity  and she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus approximately 10 years ago  which is moderately controlled with metformin. She also has hyperlipidemia managed with statins. She underwent a cholecystectomy about 5 years ago. There is no documented history of hypertension  coronary artery disease  or any other cardiovascular diseases. She has no known allergies and she does not smoke  drink alcohol  or use illicit drugs.   She has come to consult today due to a recent episode of chest pain  sweating  and difficulty in breathing. The symptoms were seemingly sudden  mimicking a heart attack  however  upon further investigation  there were no blockages observed in her coronary arteries. An EKG suggested a ventricular function consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Understanding her recent loss and the significant stress it has imposed  we believe these factors triggered Mrs. Garcia's current symptoms and are treating her condition accordingly. Psychotherapy and bereavement counseling along with standard heart failure therapies have been advised until the resolution of the ventricular dysfunction alongside her regular diabetes management.   This case demonstrates the classic link between emotional stress and the onset of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. For Mrs. Garcia  a holistic approach to her care beyond just pharmacological treatment would be important for a thorough recovery.
15,1,21,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial21,"Patient Presentation:  Patient Name: Ms. Sandra Thompson Age: 62-year-old Sex: Female Ethnicity: African-American Occupation: Retired School Teacher  Mr. Thompson presents to the emergency department with symptoms of chest pain and difficulty in breathing. She describes the chest pain as heavy  similar to a weight placed on her chest. The pain began suddenly earlier in the day and has been persistent. Accompanying the chest pain is a shortness of breath that seems to be growing progressively worse along with mild confusion.  In terms of past medical history  Ms. Thompson has been diagnosed with hypertension for which she is on daily medication. Apart from hypertension  she has a history of depression and anxiety disorder and has been under considerable stress following the recent death of her son in a car accident. She has had no surgeries or other significant medical issues in the past.  Given the acute cardiac symptoms coupled with her recent emotional stress  the differential diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was considered. As this condition  also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  is often precipitated by severe emotional distress and can mimic symptoms of a heart attack  it seems a reasonable suspicion given Ms. Thompson's presenting symptoms and recent bereavement.  Laboratory tests  chest X-ray  EKG  troponin levels  and likely an echocardiogram or cardiac MRI will be ordered to further evaluate her condition. Treatment will be initiated immediately with heart medications to lower blood pressure and slow heart rate until the test results come in and further decisions can be made.  Patient seems anxious  and reassurances are given that all necessary steps are being taken to care for her. Efforts are made to contact her daughter who lives nearby  as Ms. Thompson is currently living alone."
15,1,22,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial22,Title: A Case Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  I. Patient Identification  Our patient  Mrs. Y.F  is a 68-year-old Caucasian female. She is a retired elementary school teacher  living with her husband. She is pre-diabetic and has been managing her condition with diet and lifestyle changes.  II. Present Illness  Mrs. Y.F. was brought to the emergency department with intense chest pain  on the left side of her chest radiating to the arm  accompanied by shortness of breath. The sudden onset of these symptoms occurred after she received news that her only son was in a car accident. She has no previous history of ischemic heart disease.  III. Past Medical History  The patient has a history of pre-diabetes controlled with lifestyle changes. Additionally  she's been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and is on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Her family history includes cardiovascular diseases  her father  and paternal grandfather had a myocardial infarction. She has no history of smoking and consumes alcohol socially.   IV. Examination and Investigation  Upon examination  Mrs. Y.F. appeared anxious and in pain. ECG revealed ST-segment elevation. Troponin levels in her blood sample were found to be elevated. Further diagnostic workup  including echocardiography  showed a typical pattern of apical ballooning  consistent with a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   V. Conclusion  Mrs. Y.F suffering from takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as “broken heart syndrome”  likely triggered by severe emotional stress due to her son’s accident. The history of anxiety disorder might have contributed to her vulnerability to stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Given her pre-diabetic state and family history of cardiovascular diseases  she is at higher risk for complications  warranting careful monitoring and overall cardiovascular risk management.   This case is a good reminder of the importance of attending to not just physical but also the psychological well-being of older adults. Furthermore  it highlights how significant life stressors can trigger serious physical conditions such as takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
15,1,23,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial23,"Patient Presentation:  This is a case of Mrs. Patricia Douglas  a 65-year-old Caucasian female from Los Angeles  California  who was presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath for the past 3 hours. She reported experiencing severe emotional distress earlier in the day due to the sudden death of her husband.   Mrs. Douglas’s relevant past medical history includes well-managed hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She has no history of illicit drug use  smoking  or alcohol consumption. She has no personal or family history of coronary artery disease  arrhythmias  or any other cardiovascular diseases  and no history of psychiatric illness. Her regular medications include hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.  Upon examination  her blood pressure was elevated at 160/90 mmHg and EKG revealed ST-segment elevation  which initially raised suspicion for an acute myocardial infarction. However  cardiac enzyme tests showed only mildly elevated troponin levels  not in keeping with a full-blown heart attack.   Subsequent echocardiogram and coronary angiography revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with no significant coronary artery occlusion  supportive of a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". This presentation  along with her recent intense emotional stress  is consistent with the classic presentation of this transient heart condition.   Mrs. Douglas was admitted to the cardiology ward for further monitoring and management. She was started on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and was recommended for counselling to help cope with her emotional distress. This case underscores the close relationship between psychological stress and acute heart disease  and the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy when a patient presents with suspected acute coronary syndrome but without significant coronary artery disease."
15,1,24,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial24,"Patient Presentation:  I would like to discuss a case of a 60-year-old Hispanic female patient  Ms. Rosa Martinez  who presented with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The patient is originally from El Paso  Texas  and currently resides in Houston. She is a widow with three grown-up children and five grandchildren. She has been retired for five years and has previously worked as a school secretary. Her primary language is Spanish but she also speaks fluent English.  Her relevant past medical history includes diagnosis of hypertension  which was diagnosed around 7 years ago and is currently being controlled through medications. She has no history of diabetes mellitus or hyperlidemia. Her mother had died from heart disease at an early age  suggesting a potential genetic predisposition.   She reported that she has been under significant psychological stress due to family issues  with the recent loss of her elder sister further escalating her anxiety and depression.  Ms. Martinez has been a non-smoker all her life. She consumes alcohol occasionally and has never reported any drug abuse. Her diet is reasonably balanced and regular  but her physical activities are limited.   About one week ago  she was admitted to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain  similar to angina  with shortness of breath. The ECG was not typical for myocardial infarction but there was slight ST-segment elevation. However  subsequent angiography showed no significant blockage  which typically indicates Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  or """"broken heart syndrome.""""  The patient was immediately administered treatment for her symptoms and her condition is being closely monitored. Initial treatment includes ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics. She was also referred for psychological counseling to help manage her stress  anxiety  and depression.   Currently  her prognosis is fair  but she will require ongoing monitoring to manage her condition. She will also need to continue her medicines and might require some interventions to manage her psychological stress. She can potentially have a good quality of life with proper medical care and improvements in her lifestyle and stress management."
15,1,25,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial25,Patient Presentation:  Patient identifier: Mrs. K.C.  Sex: Female  Age: 68 years  Ethnicity: Hispanic  Occupation: Retired Primary School Teacher  Insurance: Medicare  Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  History of Present Illness: Mrs. K.C. presents to the emergency department complaining of a severe chest pain that started suddenly a few hours ago. She describes it as a crushing pain  localized at the center of her chest. The pain radiates to her left shoulder and arm. She also reports shortness of breath  and mild lightheadedness. Her symptoms began right after she received news about her older brother’s sudden death.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. K.C. has a history of hypertension that is well-controlled with losartan. She has no history of coronary artery disease  myocardial infarction  diabetes  or other cardiovascular diseases. No previous episodes of similar chest pain were reported. She was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder ten years ago  for which she takes escitalopram.  Family History: Her father died of a myocardial infarction in his 60’s. Her mother died of a stroke in her late 70’s.   Social History:  Mrs. K.C. is a non-smoker and non-drinker. She lives alone since her husband died of cancer two years ago.   Possible Diagnosis:  Given the patient's history and the acute onset of her symptoms  primarily stress-induced following the death of her brother  a potential diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (or broken-heart syndrome) is highly considered. This disease often mimics acute coronary syndrome such as myocardial infarction in postmenopausal women and is frequently associated with emotional stressors. However  a full evaluation including an electrocardiogram  blood tests  and possibly an echocardiogram is necessary to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of her chest pain such as acute MI  pericarditis  or aortic dissection.
15,1,26,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial26,Patient Presentation:  We are discussing Mrs. D  a 67-year-old Caucasian female. She is widowed and has recently undergone a considerable amount of stress due to the loss of her husband six months ago. She retired about five years ago after serving as a teacher for over 30 years. She lives alone and is relatively sedentary. She does not smoke and has quit drinking. She had occasional alcohol intakes until one year ago.  Her past medical history includes hypertension which was diagnosed five years ago and has been well managed with medication. She also has a history of hyperlipidemia treated with statins  and osteoarthritis mostly affecting her knees. There are no known allergies or previous surgeries. With regards to her family history  her father died at 65 due to a myocardial infarction  and her mother passed away at 68 with Alzheimer's disease.  Her current medication regimen includes the antihypertensive drug  Lisinopril 5mg daily  and the statin  Atorvastatin  20mg daily to manage her hyperlipidemia. She occasionally takes over-the-counter NSAIDs for her joint discomfort.  At present  Mrs. D presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain resembling angina which came on suddenly a few hours ago. There are no other associated symptoms like fever  cough  dizziness  or palpitations. She however notes having constant feelings of anxiety and sadness ever since her husband passed. Her EKG shows ST-segment elevation which could point towards an Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)  but given her recent psychological stress and lack of significant coronary artery disease risk factors  one should consider the possibility of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Preliminary blood tests  specifically for cardiac enzymes and echocardiogram  are being executed to confirm the diagnosis.
15,1,27,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial27,"Patient Presentation   Demographics:  Our patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian female. Occupation: Retired school teacher. Residence: Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania. Marital Status: Widowed. Number of Dependents: Two grown-up children  both independent.   Past Medical History:  Overall  the patient had been in relatively good health until a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. There is significant history of hypertension  controlled with medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily). The patient had a surgical history of a total right knee replacement 6 years ago. She quit smoking around 10 years ago and reports moderate alcohol use.   Patient does not have any documented history of heart disease  and there is no family history of sudden cardiac deaths. However  her father had a myocardial infarction in his late seventies.   Physical Examination and Presentation: The patient presented with complaints of sudden onset  severe chest pain radiating to her left arm which was started following the news of her sister's sudden demise. The pain was associated with shortness of breath  sweating and a sense of impending doom. On admission  her Blood Pressure was 160/100 mmHg  Pulse Rate was 110 bpm  and Respiratory Rate was 22 breaths per minute. She was afebrile. Physical examination was unremarkable apart from tachycardia.  Diagnostic Evaluation:  The EKG showed ST elevations in anterior leads. Troponin levels were elevated. An echocardiogram displayed left ventricular (LV) hypokinesis with apical ballooning  consistent with the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her coronary angiogram did not demonstrate any significant blockages  ruling out acute myocardial infarction.  Conclusion:  The diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken-heart syndrome"""" was made based on her clinical presentation  characteristic echocardiogram findings and the absence of significant coronary artery disease on angiography. The emotional stress of her sister's death was considered the likely trigger. Later  the patient responded well to ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers and supportive therapy. A follow-up echocardiogram showed improvement in LV function."
15,1,28,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial28,Slide 1: Introduction Today  we will discuss a case involving Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Slide 2: Demographics The patient  Mrs. M.F  is a 68-year-old Asian female  retired English teacher  residing in San Francisco  California. She affirms to be a non-smoker  moderate social drinker  and she doesn’t partake in any illicit substances.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mrs. M.F has a history of well-controlled hypertension  for which she takes Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg once daily.

15,1,30,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial30,Patient Presentation  I would like to discuss a case about a 67-year-old Caucasian female known by the name of Mrs. Sarah Thompson. She is retired  has no alcohol or tobacco history  and leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle characterized by minimal physical exertion. Her diet mainly consists of high-fat  high sodium foods with minimal fruits and vegetables.   Mrs. Thompson has a past medical history including type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and elevated cholesterol levels. She had a family history of cardiovascular disease with her father dying of myocardial infarction at 72. She has been prescribed Metformin for the diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Simvastatin for high cholesterol for years.   For the past 2 weeks  she has been complaining of acute chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain has been described to be sharp and is exacerbated with physical exertion. Initially  she thought it was attributed to her old age and neglected it. Although the intensity and frequency have risen dramatically  she also experienced an episode of dizziness and collapsing.   Given her symptoms and history  she was suspected of having a heart attack. Further testing revealed a surprising diagnosis: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome. This was confirmed by ventriculogram showing apical ballooning  characteristic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  In analyzing factors that could have triggered this development  Mrs. Thompson revealed that she lost her elder son to a car accident recently. She had been through a period of extreme stress and grief  which doctors believe could have led to her current condition.   This case reiterates that although Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is relatively rare  it should be considered as a differential diagnosis especially in postmenopausal women presenting with acute chest pain  especially in the context of recent physical or emotional stressors.
15,1,31,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial31,Title: Case Presentation: A Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient’s Profile: Name: Mrs. Alice Hardy Age: 63 years old  Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Provenance: Boston  Massachusetts Marital status: Widowed Occupation: Retired school teacher  Medical History:  Mrs. Hardy presented to the hospital with acute chest pain and shortness of breath. The symptoms had appeared suddenly earlier in the day and got worsened over a few hours. The patient suffered from intense emotional stress due to the recent passing of her husband.  Her past medical history reveals controlled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type-2 diabetes mellitus. She has been on medication for these illnesses for the past 15 years and has been quite consistent with her medication regimen  which includes Metformin  Lipitor  and Losartan. Additionally  she had menopause at the age of 51. She has no known history of heart diseases in her family. She does not smoke  drink  or use any illicit substances.  On physical examination  the patient seemed anxious and in pain. Her blood pressure was noted to be 153/85 mmHg and her heart rate was 110 beats/min. Her oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Cardiac auscultation revealed a rapid heartbeat but no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  Preliminary blood examinations showed elevated cardiac enzymes  which along with her symptoms raised a suspicion of acute coronary syndrome. However  the ECG was atypical for myocardial infarction  showing ST-segment elevations along with deep T-wave inversions. Further  an echocardiogram revealed left ventricular apical ballooning with preserved basal function  which is indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Hence  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress-induced or broken heart syndrome) was established. This condition is often triggered by severe emotional distress and is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction. Understanding the patient’s grave emotional stress due to bereavement  her presentation  and investigative reports  this closely fits the clinical picture of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Mrs. Hardy has been admitted to the hospital for monitoring and further evaluation to confirm the diagnosis  and commence appropriate treatment. 
15,1,32,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial32,Patient Presentation  Mrs. Donna Evans  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presents today with a chief complaint of recent-onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and occasional episodes of faintness over the last two days. Mrs. Evans is semiretired and works part-time as a receptionist at a local primary school. She is a widow and lives alone  however  she is currently socially supported by her two adult children who reside in the same city.   Past Medical History  Regarding her past medical history  Mrs. Evans has a known condition of hypertension for the last ten years which she manages with Lisinopril. She was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years ago and is on Atorvastatin for the same. Furthermore  Mrs. Evans has faced significant physical and psychological stress in recent months due to the sudden loss of her husband and a burglary incident at her home.  She admits to a history of moderate smoking earlier in life but managed to quit 15 years ago. She also admits to moderate alcohol use  up to two drinks per week. Mrs. Evans also reports experiencing several periods of intense anxiety in recent weeks  particularly surrounding the night time due to safety concerns after the burglary incident. She denies any illicit drug usage or family history of premature cardiac disease.  The patient's symptoms  coupled with her recent history of significant stress events  create a clinical suspicion of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or 'Broken Heart Syndrome'  where her heart's structure may have temporary changes due to sudden emotional or physical stress. Further evaluation is thus recommended.
15,1,33,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial33,"Presentation of Patient  Patient's Name: Mrs. Lisa Johnson Age: 63 years Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Marital Status: Widow Location: Los Angeles  California Occupation: Retired School Teacher  Medical History:  Mrs. Johnson comes with a chief complaint of experiencing severe chest pain and difficulty in breathing. Upon further inquiry  she states that the symptoms occurred suddenly just after she received news about her son's car accident. Importantly it is noted that Mrs. Johnson recently lost her husband to cancer and her anxiety level has been high for a few months.  Her past medical history indicates that she has been prehypertensive for past 5 years and is routinely taking antihypertensive medications. However  she does not have any history of established ischemic heart disease  diabetes or high cholesterol. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She has never had a surgical procedure done.  Based on the timing of her symptoms  the emotional triggers  and her hemodynamic profile  the clinical suspicion is towards Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". The disease process is thought to be linked with intense emotional or physical stress leading to severe left ventricular dysfunction.  This is an uncommon and usually temporary heart condition that is often brought about by stressful situations. The symptoms often mock those of a heart attack. Given her age  gender and recent emotional stressors  Mrs. Johnson is very representative of the patients most frequently diagnosed with this condition  post-menopausal women who've recently undergone sever emotional stress.  Further tests including electrocardiogram  blood tests  coronary angiogram  and echocardiogram will be taken immediately to confirm the diagnosis and rule out a heart attack. She will also need close monitoring since Takotsubo cardiomyopathy could potentially lead to serious complications such as heart failure  low blood pressure  heart rhythm disorders  and stroke.   Plans for ongoing supportive treatment  including medications like ACE inhibitors  beta blockers  and diuretics to reduce the load on the heart and allow it to recover will also be discussed with the patient. She will also be referred to a psychologist for an assessment and management of her persistent anxiety and emotional stress following recent life events."
15,1,34,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial34,Slide 1: Introduction ----------------------------- Subject: Presentation of a patient presenting with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 2: Demographic Information ------------------------------------------- Name: Mrs. Alice Williams Age: 68 years old Sex: Female Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired elementary school teacher Marital Status: Widowed  Residence: Lives alone in a suburban area  Slide 3: Past Medical History -------------------------------------- Mrs. Williams has a history of hypertension  for which she takes hydrochlorothiazide. She also has hyperlipidemia  controlled by atorvastatin. There is no history of smoking  alcohol abuse  drug use  or diabetes. She maintains a moderately active lifestyle.  Slide 4: Family Medical History ---------------------------------------- She has a family history of coronary artery disease as her father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65.  Slide 5: Presenting Complaint ------------------------------------ Mrs. Williams presented in the emergency department with acute chest pain and shortness of breath that started after hearing the news of her daughter's car accident.  Slide 6: Examination & Diagnosis ------------------------------------- On examination  she appeared distressed  had tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations suggesting an acute coronary syndrome. However  her coronary angiography showed no significant blockages. Given the pattern of wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography and negative coronary angiogram  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her blood tests showed a modest increase in cardiac enzymes.  Slide 7: Treatment & Prognosis ------------------------------------ Mrs. Williams was treated with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. She recovered well during hospitalization and was discharged home with a follow-up in the cardiology clinic. She was counseled about stress management and referred to a psychologist for further support.   Slide 8: Summary  ------------------------- Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or 'broken-heart syndrome ' primarily affects older women and is often triggered by severe emotional stress. The prognosis is generally good with appropriate management  but supportive care and stress management are integral to prevent possible recurrence.                    
15,1,35,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial35,"Title: Case Study - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: Name: Mrs. Jane Thompson Age: 65 years old  Gender: Female  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired school teacher Residential History: Born and raised in Chicago  Illinois. Lived in Florida since retirement five years ago.   Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Thompson was admitted to the ER with principal complaints of severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations for the last two hours after receiving distressful news of her brother's death. These are symptoms not dissimilar to a heart attack.   Medical History: Patient has a history of hyperthyroidism diagnosed 10 years ago  but her thyroid hormone levels have been well controlled with medication since then. She has also been diagnosed and managed for Type II Diabetes for the last five years with good control of her blood glucose levels. She does not smoke  drinks occasionally and maintains an active lifestyle. Mrs. Thompson has no known history of cardiac conditions and her EKGs in the past were normal.  Family History: There is family history of cardiovascular diseases. Her father passed away due to a stroke and her older sister developed myocardial infarction at the age of 72. However  no family history of any other specific cardiac conditions  like the Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  has been identified.   Current Medication: 1. Methimazole for hyperthyroidism 2. Metformin for Type II Diabetes   Tentative Diagnosis:  Considering the acute emotional distress the patient experienced directly prior to symptom onset and in the absence of significant risk factors for coronary artery disease  we are looking into the possibility of the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome."""" This condition typically mimics symptoms of a heart attack and is often precipitated by severe stress or emotional trauma. However  it will need to be confirmed through various diagnostic tests such as echocardiogram or coronary angiogram.  This case highlights the relationship between strong emotional triggers and cardiac complications. Careful and comprehensive evaluation of the patient's condition  risk factors and an individualized  holistic treatment plan are important to promote recovery."
15,1,36,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial36,"Title: A Presentation On An Elderly Female Patient With Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Hello team   I would like to present a case of an elderly female patient who has been recently diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""".  Details: Name: Mrs. X Age: 78 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Address: She presently lives alone in the suburbs of Mississippi after the demise of her husband five years ago. Her only son lives in New York and her two grandchildren visit her on holidays.  Presenting Symptoms: Mrs. X was brought to the emergency department experiencing acute chest pain  palpitations  and shortness of breath typical of heart attack symptoms. These symptoms started shortly after she received news of a relative's sudden death.  Past Medical History: Mrs. X leads a relatively healthy life with no history of smoking or drinking. She had been treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past 8 years  maintained on medications. She also has a history of osteoporosis for which she has been receiving treatment. About six months ago  Mrs. X was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder due to ongoing feelings of worry and fear  for which she had been consulting a psychiatrist. She has no known allergies.   On examination: Her blood pressure was slightly elevated  heart rate slightly increased  her cardiac sounds were normal and lungs were clear on auscultation.   Investigations: Mrs. X's electrocardiogram (ECG) showed changes similar to those seen in a heart attack. However  blood tests did not show significant elevation of cardiac enzymes usually seen in heart attacks. Echocardiogram and coronary angiogram revealed apical ballooning syndrome and absence of significant coronary artery disease typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Impression: These findings  along with her presentation  led to the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition often triggered by severe emotional stress. We believe that the news of her relative's death  alongside her underlying anxiety disorder  incited this acute event.  Plan: Mrs. X is now stable and is being monitored closely in the hospital. Her medication regimen for hypertension and hyperlipidemia has been continued  and additional heart medications have been added to manage her Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  The next course of action involves ensuring adequate cardiac recovery  relieving her symptoms  and addressing her underlying psychiatric issue regarding the anxiety disorder through appropriate referral.  Thank you for your attention. Please feel free to share any thoughts or suggestions regarding further management of Mrs. X's condition.  End of presentation."
15,1,37,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial37,Slide 1: Introduction  We are presenting the case of a 62-year-old Caucasian female who is suspected of having Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The patient  Mrs. Elizabeth James  is recently widowed and retired.  Slide 2: Demographics The patient is a nonsmoker and non-alcoholic. She is a resident of Chicago  Illinois  living with her daughter and grandchildren. She has a family history of heart disease with her late father having died of a heart attack at the age of 65.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mrs. James has a past medical history of hypertension which is managed with a low dose of Lisinopril. About six months ago  she had a minor episode of depression following the death of her husband  for which she received counseling and treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). She has no known drug allergies.   Slide 4: Pure Reason for Visit Mrs. James presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain that started suddenly while she was quarreling with a neighbor. The pain was described as a crushing-like sensation in the chest  radiating to the left arm.   Slide 5: Vital Signs and Physical Examination Upon examination  her blood pressure was 165/95  heart rate 110 bpm  respiratory rate 25 /min  and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia and an S4 gallop  but no murmurs.   Slide 6: Assessment and Plan The sudden-onset chest pain and elevated blood pressure suggest a stress-related cardiovascular event. Due to the unique features of the presentation  the possibility of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is strongly considered. We plan to admit the patient to the cardiology unit for further investigation  which will include EKG  cardiac biomarkers  echocardiography  and possibly a coronary angiogram.   Slide 7: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Overview Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy – also known as stress cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome' – is a temporary condition where the heart muscle suddenly weakens and balloons. It is generally triggered by severe stress  both physical and emotional. Its presentation closely mimics a heart attack  and hence  careful differential diagnosis is crucial.   Slide 8: Lesson from the case  This case serves as a reminder to consider Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy as a possible diagnosis in patients  particularly postmenopausal women  presenting with acute chest pain in the context of recent significant emotional stress. Prompt diagnosis and management are crucial to prevent complications and promote recovery.   Slide 9: Summary  In conclusion  the patient's recent stressful event  clinical symptoms  and family history align with a possible diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Further investigations are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment.   Slide 10: References The presentation concludes with citations from the latest research and medical case studies used for this case presentation.

15,1,38,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial38,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Profile: The patient is Ms. Jane  a 65-year-old Caucasian female who is divorced and lives alone. She is originally from Alaska but currently resides in California. Jane is retired  previously working as a high school English teacher.   Presenting Issue:   Jane presented at the EMU with chest pain and difficulty in breathing. The onset of symptoms was sudden and acute  approximately a few hours prior to admit. The chest pain is described as severe and radiating to the left arm. She has no history of chronic lung disease that could explain this symptom.   Past Medical History:   Jane is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. She maintains a healthy weight (BMI: 23) and does not have any chronic medical conditions such as diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or hypertension. She has no known heart disease or prior instances of angina or myocardial infarction.   She had experienced significant emotional stress several times in the past few months due to the death of a close friend and issues relating to her retirement.   Recent investigations conducted a year and a half ago had shown no significant abnormalities. She was not on any long-term medications.   On examination  her pulse is regular but tachycardic; blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg. The chest is clear on auscultation and heart sounds S1 and S2 are normally heard with no additional murmurs or rubs.   Conclusion: Based on clinical symptoms and precipitating stressors  a provisional diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is suspected in Jane. To confirm the condition  a coronary angiogram and Echocardiogram would be performed. Appropriate treatment and lifestyle modifications will be initiated based on the results. The stressors leading up to the presentation of this condition underline the need for comprehensive management  including psychological interventions to prevent recurrence.
15,1,39,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial39,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  recently widowed. She has been a non-smoker all her life and leads an active lifestyle with a healthy diet. She has no known allergies and has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with her father suffering from myocardial infarction at age 75 and her mother from stroke at age 70.  Past Medical History:  She has been diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia 10 years ago  which have been well-controlled with medication (Amlodipine 5mg daily and Simvastatin 20mg nightly). She has also been diagnosed with osteoporosis and has been taking Calcium and Vitamin D supplements for it. She has no reported history of diabetes  cancer  and blood disorders.  Presenting Issue:  The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  similar to that of a heart attack  which started an hour ago after receiving news of a friend passing away. Her vitals on initial assessment in the emergency department were: BP 160/100 mmHg  Pulse - 100 bpm  Temp - 98.7°F  and Respiratory Rate - 20 breaths per minute.   On the basis of her symptoms  brief history  and initial investigations  including an elevated troponin I level and ECG changes  the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome) is suspected. This is further confirmed with an Echocardiogram showing apical ballooning and reduced ejection fraction.   In conclusion  the patient's acute stress event appears to have triggered Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  a condition in which intense emotional or physical stress causes rapid and severe heart muscle weakness.
15,1,40,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial40,"Patient Presentation:  Our patient today is Ms. Anna  a 69-year-old Caucasian female who presents with symptoms suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"Broken Heart Syndrome."""" Ms. Anna is a widow and has three adult children. She lives in suburban New Jersey and was previously employed as a high school teacher before retiring.   Reason for Admission:  Ms. Anna was brought into the Emergency Department after sudden onset of severe chest pain  dyspnea (shortness of breath)  and nausea  symptoms that might have been mistaken for an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). Her symptoms began approximately seven hours ago. She reports her pain as 8/10 on the visual analogue scale.   Past Medical History:  She has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which has been well controlled with medication. Apart from hypertension  she has no other significant cardiac history until now. She has no diagnosis of diabetes  hypercholesterolemia or prior cerebrovascular accidents. She quit smoking over 10 years ago and admits she was a social drinker in her younger years but now only has an occasional glass of wine with dinner.   Psychosocial History:  Significant recent stressors in Ms. Anna's life include her husband's passing away six months ago and the death of her close childhood friend a week ago. Her current emotional state can be described as distressed and tearful  which she attributes to her recent losses.   Family History:  Her father had a heart attack at 65 years old  and her mother had arthritis. She has two brothers  one of whom has diabetes.  Physical Examination:  The physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  a heart rate of 98 bpm  and a regular rhythm. Lung auscultation is normal. Chest discomfort is reproduced by palpation  which is unlikely in heart diseases.  Further Testing:  As per standard protocol  Ms. Anna is undergoing further testing to confirm the suspected diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her initial EKG revealed ST segment elevations which is indicative of a potential heart issue. Her cardiac biomarkers have been drawn and we are awaiting results. If suspicion remains high  she may also need coronary angiography or cardiac MRI.   In conclusion  with her recent emotional stress  the absence of significant atherosclerotic disease risk factors  and clinical and EKG findings  we suspect Ms. Anna is experiencing takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She will require immediate and careful management as her condition could lead to serious complications like heart failure or even sudden death."
15,1,41,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial41,Patient Presentation:  Good afternoon  colleagues. Today  I'm here to present to you a 72-year-old Caucasian female patient with a recent diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome.'  Our patient is a widowed lady  retired school teacher and non-smoker from rural Ohio. She arrived in our emergency department following an episode of severe chest pain and shortness of breath following an exceedingly strenuous and emotional altercation with a family member. She has no history of illicit drug use or alcohol abuse.  Her past medical history includes controlled Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia but is otherwise unremarkable; she has no history of Cardiomyopathy  ischemic or valvular heart disease. Her medications include Lisinopril and Simvastatin. Until her current symptoms  she was leading an active lifestyle with regular exercise and no restrictions on her activities.  Her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with her father having succumbed to stroke at the age of 78 and her brother diagnosed with Myocardial infarction in his late 60s.   On presentation  her ECG and cardiac biomarker levels were suggestive of acute coronary syndrome but with no coronary disease observed in the left coronary angiography. Her left ventriculography  however  indicated a classic apical ballooning pattern  with reduced ejection fraction  highly suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  In sum  this lady represents a classic case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy originating from emotional stress  with a typical clinical presentation  electrocardiographic characteristics  biomarker profile  and imaging features. Comprehensive management and closely tailored follow-up are warranted.
15,1,42,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial42,"Subject: Patient Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Introduction:   We are discussing a 67-year-old  African-American female patient  whom we will call """"Patient X"""". She was born and raised in upper Manhattan  New York City  where she has lived for her entire life. She is a widow and retired school teacher  living alone.   Medical History:   Patient X has a history of well-controlled hypertension and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. She was diagnosed with both conditions 15 years ago. She is on Metformin 500 mg twice daily and Lisinopril 10 mg once daily. She has a BMI of 29 suggesting she is in the overweight category. The patient has occasional bouts of anxiety for which she has been prescribed alprazolam. She has never smoked and drinks alcohol socially.  Current Presentation:   She presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain resembling a heart attack. She also complained of difficulty in breathing  profuse sweating  and anxiety symptoms. Upon further questioning  the patient revealed she has been under considerable emotional stress lately due to the recent sudden death of her adult son.  Initial Examination & Investigations:  On examination  she had an elevated heart rate (tachycardia) and high blood pressure. Electrocardiogram showed ST-T wave changes but no signs of a blockage in the coronary arteries. Blood tests revealed slightly raised troponin levels but no other abnormalities.  Provisional Diagnosis:   Given the associated emotional stress  classic chest pain  suggestive ECG changes  and absence of coronary artery disease  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""" is suspected. This diagnosis is further supported by echocardiography demonstrating the classic """"apical ballooning"""" pattern with basal hyperkinesis and apical hypokinesis of the left ventricle.  In the context of the recent emotional stressor  the symptoms  clinical findings  and echo results point to a likely diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient is being monitored and managed conservatively with supportive therapy and expectant management for her heart to recover  along with an increased emphasis on stress and anxiety management."
15,1,43,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial43,"Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 68-year-old African American woman presenting with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient reports her symptoms began suddenly while she was at a family gathering where she received some unexpected stressful news. Her medical history reveals she is a widow with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are currently managed with medication. She has no history of tobacco or alcohol abuse  and she maintains an active lifestyle.  Vital signs show a heart rate of 110 bpm  blood pressure of 150/85 mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and SPO2 of 95% on room air.  The EKG shows ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads V2-V6  simulating an anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  lab results show only moderately elevated troponin levels and absence of significant coronary artery disease on angiography  which is atypical for a myocardial infarction.   Her echocardiogram reveals a characteristic finding of apical ballooning and basilar hypercontractility  which is consistent with a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome."""" This syndrome is a form of transient ventricular dysfunction that is often triggered by acute emotional stress.  In conclusion  despite having controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  this patient's sudden stressful event appears to have triggered takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her symptoms  EKG findings  modest troponin elevation  echocardiogram results  and the fact that her coronary angiography ruled out significant coronary artery disease  all support this diagnosis."
15,1,44,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial44,Presentation of Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: Name: Maria Rodriguez Age: 65  Gender: Female Race: Hispanic Occupation: Retired School Teacher First Language: Spanish  Fluent English Place of Residence: Reno  Nevada  Medical History: Patient has previously been diagnosed with hypertension  managed with a combination of hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. She has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which is controlled with Metformin. She also has Hypothyroidism  controlled with Levothyroxine. Her BMI is 27  placing her in the overweight category. She has a history of smoking  having quit 10 years ago  with a total of a 20 pack-year history. She drinks alcohol occasionally. There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases  her father died of a Myocardial Infarction at age 72.  Present Illness: Mrs. Rodriguez presented to the emergency room with sharp  severe chest pain  and shortness of breath beginning suddenly while attending her grandson's little league baseball game. She mentions feeling a deep emotional stress due to a personal family dispute and had experienced a panic attack just before the onset of the symptoms which she describes as ‘feeling like a heart attack’. On examination  she is slightly tachycardic and diaphoretic but hemodynamically stable. The EKG showed ST-segment elevation in precordial leads and troponin levels were moderately elevated.   Echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction (~35%)  with basal segments showing hypercontraction- all consistent with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often termed as the ‘broken heart syndrome’.   Further workup revealed no significant coronary artery disease on coronary angiography. She has been advised to stay in hospital under observation.   In conclusion  this is a presentation of a case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a post-menopausal woman with a significant history of hypertension  diabetes  and emotional stress  placing her at a higher risk for the development of this relatively rare form of cardiomyopathy. Her management will involve supportive care and stress management strategies in addition to her routine medical treatment. The prognosis for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally good with appropriate management  and we will monitor Mrs. Rodriguez closely to ensure her condition improves.
15,1,45,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial45,Title: Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 65-year-old Caucasian Female   Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female who resides in a suburban community. She is a retired teacher  a widow  and has two adult children. She is a nonsmoker  does not consume alcohol  and has no history of drug abuse. Her BMI classifies her as overweight.  Past Medical History: The patient has a notable history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which she takes medication. She had a hysterectomy due to uterine fibroids 10 years ago  but has no known allergies  no history of malignancies  and no history of connective tissue disease. She has no family history of cardiac disease.  Prior to her current presentation  the patient had been managing her hypertension and hyperlipidemia with lifestyle modifications and medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively)  with good compliance and control of her symptoms.  Patient Presentation: The patient presents with acute onset chest pain typically associated with a heart attack. The chest pain started about three hours ago and is described as sudden and severe  with a crushing quality. It is located at the center of the chest  radiating to the left arm and jaw. Accompanying symptoms include nausea  shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and a sense of impending doom.  Furthermore  the patient reports having experienced severe emotional stress following the sudden death of a close friend two days ago. She states that she had been feeling anxious and depressed since then.  Given the patient's symptoms  her significant recent emotional stressor  and corresponding EKG changes suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  she was admitted for further investigation and management.  In conclusion  this patient presents classic symptoms indicative of TTC  also known as 'broken heart syndrome ' which is often triggered by severe emotional stress. This condition mimics myocardial infarction  though in the case of TTC  routine coronary angiography typically does not show obstructions in the coronary arteries. Optimal management will involve a multidisciplinary team approach with acute symptom management  addressing the psychosocial stressors  and planning for long-term follow-up.   It's important to note the necessity of differentiating Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from acute coronary syndrome  as therapies for the two may vastly differ  with potential for harm if incorrectly diagnosed and treated.
15,1,46,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial46,"Title: Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 70-year-old Female Patient   Patient's Profile and Background:  The patient under consideration for this case study is a 70-year-old Caucasian woman named Mrs. X. She lives in the urban setup of San Francisco  California  retired  and resides with her husband. Patient weighs about 80 kilograms  stands 5'6"""" tall  and lives a rather sedentary lifestyle. She has no history of smoking or alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History:   Mrs. X has a known case of controlled hypertension and has been on medication for about a decade for the same. She also suffers from type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is on oral hypoglycemics  and she maintains an average HbA1c of around 6.5%. She was diagnosed with osteoarthritis five years ago and takes over the counter pain medication as needed.   There is no history of any cardiac disease in the family. Mrs. X has been compliant with her medications and regular follow-ups with her primary healthcare provider. She has routine lab results for hematological and biochemical parameters  which are within normal limits for her age and sex.   The case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy:  Recently  Mrs. X has presented with severe chest pain and difficulty in breathing. Initial ECG revealed an ST-segment elevation  which led to the suspicion of acute coronary syndrome. However  coronary angiography has shown no significant obstructive coronary disease.  Further investigations led to the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome. The patient reported a significant psychological stress event a few days before the onset of symptoms  the sudden demise of her older sister  which might have triggered the condition.   Echo showed hypokinesis of the mid-segments with hypercontractile apical segments  typical of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  usually transient and reversible in nature.   Mrs. X is currently receiving supportive therapy  including beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  with a focus on stress management to prevent further complications.   In conclusion:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction with symptoms mimicking acute coronary syndrome. It is predominantly observed in post-menopausal women and often triggered by psychological stress. The timely diagnosis and appropriate management can lead to complete reversal of the condition in most cases."
15,1,47,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial47,"Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female presenting with symptoms indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress or """"broken heart"""" Syndrome. She was admitted to the emergency department complaining of chest pain  shortness of breath  and general weakness which started shortly after hearing about her husband's unexpected death.  She has been living in Shaker Heights  Ohio for 40 years  is widowed  and currently lives alone. She retired 5 years ago and used to work as a primary school teacher. The patient doesn't smoke or consume alcohol but has a history of stress-related disorders  specifically  she was diagnosed with panic disorder and PTSD in the past. She is currently under medication and seeing a psychiatrist for her mental health issues.  She has no history of coronary heart disease  high blood pressure or diabetes. However  she has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia  on statin medication for the same. Her mother died in her early 70s due to myocardial infarction and her elder sister has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.  On examination  her blood pressure  pulse rate  and oxygen saturation were within normal limits. An ECG revealed ST-segment elevation  which is typically observed in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However  further tests including angiogram did not show any blockages in the coronary arteries. An echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle  supporting a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  The next steps are to manage her acute symptoms  and once stabilized  provide mental health support. Prognosis in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally good  although it may take weeks to months for the heart to fully recover. There may be a need to adjust her medications given her new diagnosis  and following her acute management  she might benefit from the introduction of a beta-blocker."
15,1,48,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial48,"Patient Presentation  Today we're discussing Mrs. Regina Morgan  a 65-year-old African-American female who presents with symptoms suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Demographic Information:  Mrs. Regina hails from Charlotte  North Carolina. She worked as a school teacher for 40 years before retiring five years ago. She is a widow with 2 grown-up children living in different states. Up until recently  she lived independently and was actively involved in her local community church.  Medical History: Past records indicate that Mrs. Regina is a non-smoker. She has a history of hypertension for the past ten years  which has been managed reasonably well with Angiotensin II receptor blockers. She also has a history of hyperlipidemia for the last five years and is on low-dose statins. Additionally  she was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus three years ago.  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Regina has been experiencing episodic chest pain radiating to her left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath  nausea  and episodes of profuse sweating over the past three days. The symptoms have been worsening  prompting her visit to the hospital. According to her  she has been under significant stress because of her elder brother's recent demise  which she has been struggling to cope with.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  Mrs. Regina appeared anxious. Vital signs were stable except for marginal blood pressure elevation (systolic 150mmHg). On cardiac examination  no significant murmurs were detected  but an S3 gallop rhythm was noted. There were no signs of congestive heart failure. Her ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  while her Troponin I levels were slightly elevated.   In light of her acute chest pain episodes and ECG changes  Mrs. Regina was hospitalized and further investigated. An echocardiogram showed apical ballooning and basal hypercontractility  indicating Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Discussion: Also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome """" Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is seen predominantly in post-menopausal women  often following a significant emotional or physical stress event. It resembles acute myocardial infarction clinically but is characterized by transient left ventricular apical ballooning in the absence of coronary artery occlusion. Despite the dramatic presentation  most patients have a good prognosis and recover within weeks.   This case exemplifies the severe impact emotional stress can have on heart health  particularly in susceptible individuals with preexisting hypertension and diabetic status  underscoring the importance of comprehensive and empathetic patient care. Further treatment will be discussed in the consulting team."

She presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and breathing difficulty. Mrs. V is a widow with two adult children and lives alone. She is retired and is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She had reported a recent episode of significant emotional stress after the sudden loss of a loved one.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. V's past medical history is significant for hypertension  controlled with medication  and mild osteoporosis. She is also on low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Her family history is positive for cardiac diseases with her father passing away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 75 and her brother surviving a stroke at 68.   She has not been previously diagnosed with any cardiac conditions but has had intermittently elevated blood pressures at previous medical visits which led to her being prescribed a low dose of an antihypertensive drug. She is compliant with her medications and attends yearly checkups and screenings.  She reports she is generally in good health and usually engages in mild physical activity in the form of morning walks. However  due to her recent incident  she has been experiencing severe chest pains  radiating to the left arm  which are accompanied by shortness of breath and occasional fainting spells.  Her presentation is characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or stress cardiomyopathy  a condition often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress leading to rapid and severe heart muscle weakness  chest pain  and shortness of breath. It is also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""" matching the emotional stress she recently experienced. This condition often affects postmenopausal women and is not often associated with blocked coronary arteries.   Further workup is warranted including an EKG  chest x-ray  and cardiac enzymes. Timely treatment can prevent complications and  in most cases  the heart muscle recovers completely within one to several weeks."

Her family history reveals that her father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and her mother passed due to ovarian cancer. Ms. Linda has no known drug allergies; she takes daily doses of Lisinopril 20mg and simvastatin 20mg.   Two weeks ago  she had a traumatic experience when she was involved in a car accident  which shocked her significantly. Emotional stress makes her a candidate for takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome. Further examinations and tests are recommended to confirm this diagnosis and to know the best treatment approach for her case. It's imperative for Ms. Linda to monitor her symptoms and look for ways to manage stress in the future.
15,1,51,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial51,Subject: Patient Case Presentation: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy   Patient Information: The patient is a 72-year-old  Caucasian female named Ms. Marie Smith.   Demographics: She is recently widowed and lives alone. Ms. Smith is a retired schoolteacher who has lived in the Midwest for her entire life. She is non-smoker and alcohol consumption is limited to occasional social drinking. Besides experiencing recent significant emotional stress due to the loss of her spouse  she has no known history of illicit drug use.  Past Medical History:  She has a notable history of hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. There is no known history of coronary artery disease  myocardial infarction  or any other form of heart disease. However  she has been moderately controlled on ACE inhibitors and statins for the past ten years. She also has well controlled hypothyroidism on L-thyroxine replacement.  Presenting Complaint: Ms. Smith presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain  radiating to her left shoulder and dyspnea that started suddenly over the past several hours. The pain was worse when she took deep breaths  and it was not relieved by rest. She also described palpitations and diaphoresis.   Physical Examination: Upon examination  she was found to be in evident distress. Height and weight were within normal range and vitals were stable except for sinus tachycardia. Auscultation revealed no murmurs  rubs  or gallops and lungs were clear.  Pre-Sumptive Diagnoses: Considering the patient's symptoms and the recent extreme emotional stress  a working diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is suspected. Myocardial injury due to potential acute coronary syndrome or myocarditis has not been excluded yet.   The patient has been admitted for monitoring  and further diagnostic investigations have been planned including EKG  cardiac enzymes  and echocardiogram. Psychiatric support has been engaged to help manage her mental stress and grief as well due to the potential role in the development of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Ms. Smith’s case is a classic presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which primarily presents in post-menopausal women  triggered by a significant emotional event. The syndrome mimics acute coronary syndrome  but most patients don't have obstructive coronary artery disease  which aligns with Ms. Smith’s medical history.  Please discuss any suggestions or recommendations for her treatment plan.
15,1,52,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial52,Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Introduction: Here we present the case of a 67 year-old Caucasian female  Mrs. Jane  who presents with acute onset Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The patient lives independently and her primary language is English. She admits to occasional alcohol consumption but not to any illicit substance use or smoking.   Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Jane presented herself to the hospital after experiencing sudden penultimate chest pains while in the midst of an intense disagreement with her neighbor. She reported a sensation of “crushing” chest pain which persisted for a couple of hours  accompanied by shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: Upon reviewing Mrs. Jane’s medical history  she was diagnosed previously with hypertension 10 years ago  which is well controlled with medication. She also has well-managed hypothyroidism. There is no history of heart disease  diabetes  or other conditions that could potentially cause or likely exacerbate coronary artery disease.   Family History: Her mother suffered from coronary artery disease in her 80s but there is no family history of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac deaths in the family.   Lifestyle: The patient is generally active with light routine physical activity and a balanced diet. She has experienced notable stress due to the recent death of her husband and ongoing conflicts with her neighbor. She lives alone  is independent and socially active in her community.   Conclusion: This case demonstrates an incidence of acute Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  or ‘broken heart syndrome’  potentially triggered by intense psychological stress  in a patient with a relatively low cardiovascular risk profile. It draws attention to the significance of social  emotional  and psychological factors in cardiac health.   Plan:  Physician should thoroughly evaluate her overall status through ECG  echocardiogram  blood tests  and coronary angiography. Offer appropriate intervention such as medications for temporary heart function improvement. Collaboration with a mental health professional could be of benefit to help Mrs. Jane cope with her emotional distress.
15,1,53,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial53,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian female  Mrs. Jane Smith  who has presented with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She is a retired teacher  lives with her husband  is a non-smoker  and drinks alcohol socially. Her past medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  which are well-managed with medication.  Mrs. Smith reports the occurrence of her symptoms started suddenly while she was having a heated argument with a neighbor. The level of pain she's experiencing is 8 out of 10  which was not relieved by a 325 mg oral dose of aspirin at home.   She has a family history of ischemic heart diseases; her mother had myocardial infarction at the age of 68 and her eldest brother suffered from angina. Mrs. Smith has no known allergies or intolerances to medications.  Upon examination  Mrs. Smith appears stressed  and is in obvious discomfort while talking. Her vitals on arrival are: Blood Pressure - 150/90 mmHg  Heart Rate - 110 beats/min  Temp - 98.6 F  Resp - 20 breaths/min  O2 Saturation - 94% on room air. Pathological Q waves are observed in the anterolateral leads on her 12-lead electrocardiograph (ECG) strip. Cardiac biomarkers (Troponins) are elevated.  The patient's symptoms  ECG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest acute coronary syndrome. However  due to lack of any significant coronary artery disease in coronary angiogram and left ventricular apical ballooning in echocardiogram  the provisional diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome was made.   The most probable triggering factor in this case is intense emotional stress. The patient should be closely monitored in the Intensive Care Unit  and once stable  would benefit from cardiac rehabilitation and psychological therapies to help manage stress levels.  In summary  Mrs. Smith is a 70-year-old female with a past history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  presenting with symptoms and signs suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  triggered by acute emotional stress.
15,1,54,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial54,Patient Presentation:  We are discussing a 72-year-old female patient  Mrs. L  who hails from a Hispanic background and lives alone in Boston  Massachusetts. She lives independently and has a history of chronic anxiety and mild depression. The patient is widowed and has three adult children. According to her medical documentation  she is a non-smoker  and does not consume alcohol either. She is not known to suffer from any allergies.   Past Medical History:  She has a documented history of hypertension  which is well-controlled with Amlodipine. She has no prior cardiac history. Furthermore  alongside her anxiety and depression  Mrs. L has been struggling with insomnia for the past couple of years. She is currently on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiety and depression and a standard dose of Zolpidem for insomnia.   Presentation with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy:  Mrs. L presented to the emergency department with complaints of acute chest pain and difficulty in breathing. The symptoms started suddenly when she was informed about the sudden death of her close friend. The chest pain was squeezing in quality and the severity was 8 on a scale of 10  with 10 being the most severe pain. Her ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads.   Further examination recorded hypotension and mild tachycardia. The initial diagnosis was an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However  further examination through coronary angiography didn’t show any significant obstructive coronary artery disease. Instead  the imaging found a significant reduction of the left ventricular function with apical ballooning  and basal hyper contractility  compatible with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   This diagnosis represents a classic case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome) that typically presents following a severe emotional stressor. In Mrs. L's case  it was the sudden death of her close friend. Moving forward  the plan is to manage Mrs. L's condition with supportive therapy  which includes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics.   In conclusion  this case underscores the significant impact of severe emotional stress in patients predisposed to anxiety and its potential to manifest as serious physical illness like Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It also emphasizes the importance of recognizing this syndrome as a potential differential in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.
15,1,55,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial55,Subject: Comprehensive Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:  Name: Mrs. Jane Miller Age: 65  Sex: Female  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Complaint: Mrs. Miller presents with acute chest pain and shortness of breath  symptoms mimicking a heart attack.  Medical History:   Mrs. Miller has a documented history of hypertension over the past ten years  which is managed by a combination of dietary adjustments and prescription medication. She has no history of coronary artery disease or other serious cardiac conditions. She has occasional episodes of atrial fibrillation but is generally well-managed with beta-blockers. She is also a former smoker  having quit approximately 20 years ago. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease with both her father and her older brother experiencing heart attacks in their late 50s.  Recent Events:  Mrs. Miller recently experienced a highly stressful life event with the sudden passing of her husband of 40 years. Following this event  she presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain and was admitted for suspected myocardial infarction (heart attack).  Clinical Findings:  Upon admission  electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation and blood tests revealed slightly elevated cardiac enzyme levels. However  upon carrying out an angiogram  no coronary artery blockage was detected. Echocardiography and cardiac MRI showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction  indicative of stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy.  Impression:   In light of the patient's recent emotional trauma  presentation of symptoms and the findings from cardiac imaging  a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made  also often referred to as broken heart syndrome. This temporary heart condition often occurs in response to severe stress  where the heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or stunned  causing the left ventricle of the heart to change shape. Expected recovery is within weeks or months with appropriate treatment and reduction of stress.  Next steps:  The patient will be managed with heart failure medications including ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. Treatment will also include counselling and recommending stress management techniques to help her handle stress more effectively. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to assess recovery and to adjust the medication regimen as needed.
15,1,56,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial56,"Patient Presentation:  Good morning/afternoon team   Our patient is Mrs. Gomez  a 68-year-old Hispanic female  who presents with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. She had sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath that started a few hours ago. This started after she received news about the sudden death of her son  which was a very stressful event for her.  She has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which is well controlled with hydrochlorothiazide  and aged-related hyperlipidemia that is managed with atorvastatin. She underwent a total knee replacement surgery six months ago and has been in good health since her last postoperative check.   She had an episode of severe emotional stress just before the onset of her current symptoms  hence the suspicion of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy has arisen also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". However  routine non-invasive diagnostic tests to confirm this are currently pending.  She has no previous history of heart diseases  no family history of early coronary artery disease  and she does not smoke or drink alcohol.   That ends our brief discussion about Mrs. Gomez. Please feel free to ask any questions or make suggestions for the next step in her management."
15,1,57,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial57,"Title: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  The patient under consideration  Mrs. Sara Thompson is a 65-year-old Caucasian female with an active lifestyle who recently retired from her management position. She arrived at our medical facility presenting symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Mrs. Thompson has a past medical history of anxiety disorder and hypertension managed by psychotherapy and medications  respectively  and is otherwise generally healthy. Her daily medications consist of prescribed anti-hypertensive and anti-anxiety drugs which she claims she takes consistently. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol moderately. Additionally  family history discloses her mother had a myocardial infarction at an early age of 60.  Three days ago  Mrs. Thompson experienced a significantly distressing bereavement - the sudden loss of her husband. Following this  she noted the sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath which have been persistent. The chest pain  as she describes  """"feels like a heavy weight placed on her chest"""".  Upon physical examination  Mrs. Thompson appears acutely distressed due to pain. Her blood pressure readings are elevated and EKG findings are suggestive of ST-segment elevation. Troponin levels  markers for heart muscle damage  are also increased  which may misinterpret her condition as an acute myocardial infarction.  Nevertheless  the absence of coronary artery disease and her recent exposure to severe emotional stress are strongly indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  frequently referred to as 'broken heart syndrome'.  The aforementioned constellation of symptoms  clinical findings  and patient history brings up the differential diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Further tests including echocardiogram and cardiac MRI are warranted to confirm the diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis and proper management are crucial in such cases as the condition usually mimics acute coronary syndrome and may lead to severe  potentially fatal complications such as heart failure  arrhythmias  and cardiogenic shock if not treated promptly."
15,1,58,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial58,"Title: Case Presentation for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:  The patient is a 66-year-old Caucasian female  named Mrs. T. She is a retired teacher and lives with her husband in the suburbs. She is a non-smoker with minimal alcohol intake. She has two children and three grandchildren who live nearby.   Past Medical History:  Mrs. T has a known history of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from a car accident twenty years ago. She does not have a history of hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or other chronic diseases. She previously underwent cholecystectomy and hysterectomy.   Presenting Complaint: Mrs. T was brought to the emergency department by her husband following an episode of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started an hour ago. She described the pain as similar to """"an elephant sitting on the chest."""" These symptoms developed shortly after hearing the sudden news of her brother's unexpected passing.   Physical Examination: On examination  she was diaphoretic with a blood pressure of 155/85 mmHg  pulse 110 bpm  respiratory rate 22 per minute  and SpO2 of 96% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia  but there were no murmurs  rubs  or gallops on auscultation. Pulmonary and abdominal examinations were unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Blood investigations revealed significantly elevated troponin levels. However  a coronary angiography did not demonstrate any significant stenosis or occlusion. Given her symptoms  together with the ECG and angiographic findings and particularly her recent emotional stress  a presumptive diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (or broken heart syndrome) was made.   During her hospital stay  she underwent Transthoracic echocardiography which confirmed the diagnosis  showing apical ballooning and systolic dysfunction characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  with preserved function at the base of the heart.  Plan: Mrs. T was managed with supportive care  including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. She was reassured and counseled about the condition. We also emphasized the importance of stress management  therapy for her PTSD  and a regular follow-up. The prognosis for her condition is generally good  with most patients experiencing a full recovery of left ventricular function within weeks to months."
15,1,59,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial59,Slide 1: Introduction Patient Identification: Mrs. Tracy Gibson  a 72-year-old Caucasian female  Slide 2: Chief Complaint Mrs. Gibson presented in the emergency room with acute onset chest pain  extreme fatigue  palpitations  and breathlessness  symptoms resembling a heart attack.  Slide 3: Medical History Patient has a 10-year history of hypertension  well-controlled with medication. She has no troubling family health history or any history of personal substance abuse.   Slide 4: Recent Life Events Mrs. Gibson recently became a widow when she lost her beloved husband of 50 years to cancer just two weeks ago.  Slide 5: Diagnosis Given the patient’s recent extreme emotional stress coupled with the symptoms that mimic those of a heart attack  a presumed diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or broken heart syndrome  has been made.  Slide 6: Test Results Cardiac enzyme levels were found to be normal  and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation  which initially suggested myocardial infarction. However  a subsequent coronary angiogram was surprisingly normal and an echocardiogram demonstrated reduced left ventricular function with the apex of the heart being unresponsive.  Slide 7: Management and Prognosis Mrs. Gibson responded well to heart failure medication  including ACE inhibitors and beta blockers. Her symptoms abated and ventricular function improved over the subsequent weeks. Given the transient nature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the patient’s otherwise general good health  she has a good prognosis and is expected to make a complete recovery. However  she has been referred to a psychologist to help her cope with her bereavement  given its likely contribution to her physical health.
15,1,60,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial60,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Lenora Jones is a 68-year-old Caucasian retiree who presented to the emergency department following an episode of acute chest pain. The symptoms started suddenly during a major argument with her neighbor. She experienced a severe midsternal chest pain radiating to her left arm  associated with shortness of breath and dizziness. Her vital signs on admission were a blood pressure of 140/70 mmHg  pulse rate 100/min  and respiratory rate 20/min.   Demographic Information:   Ms. Lenora Jones lives independently in a small town and has a history of mild hypertension  well controlled on daily medication. She was widowed three years ago and has managed to stay healthy and active  enjoying walks and gardening. She has not been hospitalized before  has no allergy history  does not smoke  drink or use illicit drugs. She also has no family history of ischemic heart disease.   Past Medical History:   Ms. Jones has been under the treatment of her primary care physician  Dr. Mitchell  for hypertension for the past five years. She has been taking amlodipine 5mg daily  to which her blood pressure has well responded. She denies having any episodes of chest pain in the past. She also has osteoporosis for which she is on regular vitamin D and calcium supplements. Laboratory results show that her cholesterol  fasting sugar levels and thyroid function tests are within the normal range. A previous ECG taken two years back was normal.   To summarize  Ms. Jones is a hypertensive patient who experienced an episode of acute chest pain under severe emotional stress. Similar to most patients diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  she is an elderly woman with a relatively low cardiovascular risk profile other than hypertension.
15,1,61,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial61,"Slide 1: Presentation Overview  This presentation discusses a patient diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'. TTC is a temporary heart condition often triggered by stressful situations  mimicking symptoms of a heart attack.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian female; she is a retired school teacher and a widow for 5 years. She resides in a suburban community and lives alone. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially. She has two adult children living out of state.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms  The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath  which started after news of an unexpected death of a close friend. The pain was described as intense  crushing  and radiating to the left arm  similar to a classic heart attack symptom.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  Patient has a history of hypertension controlled with medication and managed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. She has no known allergies. Previous health conditions include normal cholesterol levels and no prior history of heart-related issues or stroke. She also has a history of mild depression following her husband's death.  Slide 5: Differential Diagnosis  Diagnosis revealed no blockages in the coronary arteries  a common indication of a heart attack. Her EKG abnormalities and blood tests showed elevated cardiac enzymes  initially pointing towards a possible myocardial infarction. However  cardiac MRI and echocardiography revealed a characteristic """"Takotsubo"""" or """"octopus pot"""" shape of the left ventricle  indicative of TTC.  Slide 6: Summary  The current presentation and testing suggest a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  triggered as a response to acute emotional stress. Clinical management is primarily supportive care  with the prognosis being generally good  as the heart often recovers fully in days or weeks. However  given the patient's age and pre-existing conditions  recurrent episodes could present a substantial risk for heart failure. Psychological support and stress management strategies will be a crucial part of her long-term therapeutic management."
15,1,62,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial62,Patient Presentation:  Patient Initials: M.R  Age: 67 years old  Gender: Female  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Past Medical History:   1. Hypertension 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 3. Major depressive disorder 4. No known history of coronary artery disease or previous heart conditions  Presenting Complaint:  Mrs. M.R was brought into the emergency department following an episode of intense emotional stress during which she experienced severe chest pain and shortness of breath.   Clinical Assessment and Suspected Diagnosis:  Based on physical examination and presenting symptoms  severe emotional stress  and no prior history of underlying cardiovascular diseases  the suspected diagnosis is takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome).  EKG shows ST-segment elevation consistent with acute myocardial infarction. However  as the patient has no previous history of cardiac issues  the more likely diagnosis is takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Troponin levels are slightly elevated  which is also consistent with this diagnosis  although these findings can also be seen in myocardial infarction.   Echocardiogram revealed akinesis of the mid-left ventricle and apical segments with basal hyperkinesis  which is consistent with the typical appearance of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiogram  which was performed due to initial concern for myocardial infarction  came back with no significant coronary artery disease.  These findings further support the indication of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is characterized by transient regional systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle  mimicking myocardial infarction  but in the absence of angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture.  In conclusion  considering the clinical and investigative findings  Mrs. M.R is diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy triggered by emotional stress. The management plan will be medical therapy  psychological support  and regular cardiology follow-up.
15,1,63,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial63,Patient Presentation   Mrs. L is a 63-year-old Caucasian female from Southern England who presents with chest pain and dyspnea  symptom durations extending over a span of 24 hours. She lives alone and was recently widowed  after a 45-year marriage. She also retired early from work due to the death of her husband.  In terms of past medical history  Mrs. L does not have any significant illnesses. No history of coronary artery disease  hypertension  diabetes  or any other cardiovascular diseases was reported other than sporadic migraines and occasional episodes of vertigo. She has an allergy to penicillin  which causes skin rash. She denies alcohol or tobacco use and her family history is notable for a father who died from a stroke at age 70 and a mother who had no significant illness and died at age 89 of unknown cause. No history of sudden death or cardiomyopathies in the family was reported.  On examination  her general condition is good but there’s clear distress due to the chest pain. Her vitals include: blood pressure: 140/90 mmHg in both arms  pulse: 112 bpm and regular  respiration: 22 cycles per minute  temperature: 37.8˚c oral  and oxygen saturation: 96% on room air. The cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia  no murmurs  rubs or gallops  and the lungs are clear bilaterally.  Due to the patient's presentation and sudden onset of severe symptoms corresponding to emotional stress  a differential diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart syndrome) is being considered  and a series of diagnostic tests including an electrocardiogram  echocardiogram  blood tests  coronary angiogram  and cardiac MRI are suggested to confirm the diagnosis.
15,1,64,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial64,Subject: 65-year-old Caucasian female  Presenting Complaints: Acute chest pain and shortness of breath   Medical History: Former smoker with a history of hypertension; Patient has a history of major depressive disorder and anxiety managed by a psychiatrist. She reports no personal or family history of ischemic heart disease or cardiomyopathies.  Vital Signs: BP 155/95 mmHg  HR 88 beats/minute  RR 20 breaths/minute  temp 37.1°C  O2 Sat 96% room air  Physical examination: Patient appears distressed. Cardiac examination reveals tachycardia without murmurs  rubs  or gallops; her lungs are clear to auscultation; the remainder of her physical exam is unremarkable.  Based on clinical history  presentation  and early investigations  the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'  is suspected. This condition often mimics myocardial infarction and is triggered by severe stress  both physical and emotional. ECG suggests significant ST-segment elevation in precordial leads (V2–V6) and inferior leads II  III  and aVF; no previous ECG is available for comparison.   Laboratory studies show modest elevation in cardiac troponin I levels  which peaked at 6.3 ng/mL (reference range  0–0.04 ng/mL)  but normal Creatine Kinase-MB (CK-MB) level. The patient's remaining blood workup including complete blood count  basic metabolic panel  coagulation studies  thyroid function tests  and lipid profile are all within normal limits.  Following cardiology consultation  bedside echocardiography shows hypokinesis of apical and midsegments and hypercontraction of the basal segments of the left ventricle (LV)  a typical finding in Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The patient will be admitted to the cardiology unit for further management and monitoring.   Further management would include discontinuation of any possible precipitating medications  initiation of a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor in the acute phase along with supportive care (e.g.  treating triggering stressors). Our mental health team will also be involved due to her history of depression and anxiety which could have potentially triggered this event.  Please remember: in patients  especially post-menopausal women  presenting with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome but without typical risk factors or past history  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy should be considered as a differential diagnosis. Stressful events  both physical or emotional  can prelude symptoms. 
15,1,65,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial65,Presentation of Patient Case  The subject is Ms. Rebecca Thompson  a 65-year old  Caucasian woman from Denver  Colorado who was primarily referred by her general practitioner. She is a retired school teacher  lives alone and has two grown-up children living out-of-state. The patient’s main complaints include chest pain and shortness of breath which has been occurring for the past two days.   Past history reveals that she doesn’t have any chronic diseases like hypertension  diabetes mellitus  or atherosclerotic heart disease. She is a non-smoker and doesn't indulge in alcohol consumption. She has not had any surgical interventions in the past. She had regular mammograms done which were normal  and no significant family history of heart disease or cancer is detected. She is moderately active  doing yoga and light walks regularly.  Recently  the patient had experienced a highly emotional traumatic incident – her only sibling passed away following a long struggle with cancer. She admits having immense stress handling her grief which got exacerbated due to social isolation during COVID times. She is also suffering from sleep irregularity and occasional anxiety disorder. This history was considered significant as intense emotional or physical stress leading to acute heart failure is the classic feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Although her initial ECG and troponin levels hinted towards acute myocardial infarction  the subsequent angiogram revealed no significant blockages in the coronary arteries which is a key factor in diagnosing takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction with the classical apical ballooning  further supporting our suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  To summarize  the onset of the patient’s symptoms can be linked to her recent emotional trauma supported by the imaging findings  making takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) a likely diagnosis. Moving forward  we will be focusing on supportive management  arranging appropriate psychiatric intervention to address her emotional stress  and close follow-up to monitor her cardiac function.

Mrs. X has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and anxiety disorder. She denied previous cardiac diseases and any known heart defects.   History of Present Illness:  Mrs. X reported that her symptoms started abruptly two hours previously while she was dealing with a stressful domestic event. She indicated that the pain was severe  radiating  and associated with an abrupt shortness of breath. No associated symptoms such as sweating  fainting  or nausea were reported. There was no history of recent trauma  viral illnesses or illicit drug intake.  Demographical Information:  Mrs. X lives with her husband in a suburban neighborhood; she’s a retired teacher  doesn’t smoke or drink alcohol and no known drug allergies.   Past Medical History:  Mrs. X has been diagnosed with hypertension for 10 years now  for which she is taking Lisinopril 10mg once daily. Also  has hyperlipidemia for which she takes 20mg of Atorvastatin daily. She has an anxiety disorder and is under treatment with Citalopram 20mg once daily for the last five years. She is routinely followed up by her family physician for these issues. Her immunizations are up to date.   Family History:  Positive for cardiovascular disease. Her father died from myocardial infarction at the age of 75 and her mother has a history of stroke.   Clinical Assessment:  On examination  the patient was anxious and diaphoretic with stable vital signs; Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg  heart rate 80 beats per minute regular  respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.   Preliminary Diagnosis:  Given the acute onset of symptoms following physical stress  takotsubo cardiomyopathy is strongly suspected. Further investigations including cardiac enzyme evaluation  EKG  echocardiogram  and possibly coronary angiogram will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of her symptoms including acute coronary syndrome.   Treatment Plan:  The therapeutic approach will depend on the results of her investigations. If confirmed  her treatment will primarily focus on supportive care  and management of the heart failure symptoms. Additionally  she may be treated with medications to reduce her body's response to stress and improve heart function. Long term management will include stress management and treating her co-existing medical conditions.
15,1,68,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial68,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension and episodes of major depressive disorder. She is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol. She's been relatively healthy all her life and has maintained an active lifestyle  including regular walking and gardening.   Recent History and Symptoms:  She recently presented at the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to the left shoulder  associated with shortness of breath and light-headedness. These symptoms were initially mistaken for a myocardial infarction. The episode occurred suddenly during a stressful family conflict. Upon arrival at the emergency department  an electrocardiogram was performed showing no signs of ST-segment elevation—typically seen in myocardial infarction cases.  Diagnosis Summary:  Given the symptoms  age  sex  and situation of emotional stress that triggered the events  along with the ECG findings  a possible diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  was suspected. Echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis showing typical findings of """"apical ballooning""""  a condition in which the apex of the heart enlarges while the base functions normally  mimicking a tako-tsubo  a Japanese octopus trapping pot.  Management Plan:  Currently  the patient is under careful observation and provided symptomatic treatment  focusing on the management of chest pain and breathlessness. The goal is to support her heart function with medication and minimize emotional stress. She is recommended to follow-up closely with the cardiology clinic  and psychological support is also suggested to mitigate her depressive symptoms and the impact of stress on her heart condition in the future."
15,1,69,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial69,Patient Profile:  Patient Name: Mrs. Lydia Thompson Age: 62 Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher Residential Area: Urban Marital Status: Widowed Smoking History: Non-smoker  Presenting Issue: Mrs. Thompson presented at the ER with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG results showed abnormalities  and blood tests disclosed elevated cardiac enzymes. Notably  she had recently experienced her husband's unexpected death  a significantly stressful life event.  Past Medical History:   History details indicate that she has been relatively healthy; her previous medical history doesn't suggest chronic diseases such as diabetes  hypertension  or hyperlipidemia. She found herself in menopause at the age of 50.  She has a family history of myocardial infarction in both her father (at the age of 66) and her older brother (at the age of 60). However  she hasn't been previously hospitalized or diagnosed with any cardiac diseases.  Psychological History: Mrs. Thompson has not been previously treated for any mental health conditions. The recent loss of her husband was a significant emotional hardship  though  and the stress may have triggered her current condition. She doesn't have a history of alcohol or substance abuse. She has a well-maintained social life and is active within her community.  Summary: With the atypical chest pain  ECG changes  and the release of cardiac enzymes  along with the absence of coronary artery disease  Mrs. Thompson was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as “broken heart syndrome”). In consideration of her past medical history and the recent emotional event  the diagnosis aligns with the typical precipitating factors and demographic most often affected by this type of heart failure.
15,1,70,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial70,Subject: Presentation of Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information: Name: Ms. Jane Doe Age: 58 years  Sex: Female    Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired school teacher  Residence: Urban area  Medical Background: Chief Complaint: Chest Pain Ms. Jane Doe presents to the emergency department with severe  acute chest pain with a precipitating stressor - the sudden death of a close family member. The pain started one hour ago and has been persistent since then.   Past Medical History:  Ms. Jane Doe has a past history of controlled hypertension and general anxiety disorder. She had been on medications for both. She has no history of drug allergies  and there is no family history of early heart disease. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. She has been moderately physically active  maintaining a balanced diet but with a BMI of 27.1 suggesting overweight.  Exam Findings: On physical examination  she is found distressed with clear evidence of acute pain. Vital signs show tachycardia and mildly increased blood pressure. Heart auscultation reveals no murmurs  rubs or gallops. Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrates ST segment elevation  mimicking myocardial infarction. The blood tests show minimal elevation of cardiac enzymes.   Diagnosis: Taking into concern her presentation of acute chest pain  ECG changes and the extreme emotional stressor  she was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome'.   Plan: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) for further investigation and management. She was placed on appropriate medications to manage her acute symptoms  including beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. She was also referred to a psychologist for management of her generalized anxiety disorder in light of the acute stressor.   As part of her discharge planning and long-term management  she would have follow-up appointments with her cardiologist and psychologist with an emphasis on stress management  maintaining physical activity and managing her weight.   Consultations: -Cardiologist -Psychologist -Nutritionist/Dietitian for weight management.  In Conclusion: Ms. Jane Doe  a 58-year old female with a background of hypertension and generalized anxiety disorder  presented with takotsubo cardiomyopathy probably precipitated by a severe emotional stressor. She was managed in the CCU and will have ongoing follow-up to continue her care and prevent recurrent episodes. As part of her holistic care  psychological support and weight management alongside her cardiac care remain an essential part of her management plan.

Past Medical History ==================== In terms of cardiovascular history  she has been on amlodipine and atorvastatin for hypertensive heart disease and hypercholesterolemia  respectively. Both have been fairly well controlled with regular monitoring. She also has a past medical history suggestive of psychosocial stresses  including anxiety and depression  for which she has been attending psychotherapy sessions. There are no drug allergies or other remarkable personal or familial disease history.  Current Presentation ==================== She experienced an acute episode of severe chest pain during a stressful event (passing of her pet)  associated with shortness of breath  nausea  and diaphoresis. Initially suspected to be an acute myocardial infarction due to her age  past medical history  and current presentation  she was immediately rushed to the emergency department. Subsequent investigation showed a paradoxical presentation: her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed ST-elevation  but her cardiac enzymes were only moderately elevated.   An urgent echocardiogram indicated a reversible dysfunction of the left ventricle  predominantly at the apex  giving the left ventricle a distinctive shape known as ‘apical ballooning’. Coronary angiography showed no blockages in the coronary arteries that could explain these findings.   These symptoms and some further tests confirmed a working diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" which generally presents in postmenopausal women with a precipitating severe emotional or physical stressor. Her severe emotional stress due to the passing of her pet seemed to precipitate this syndrome.  Plan of Care ============= Management included supportive measures  optimization of cardiac output  and monitoring for complications. Psychotherapy sessions were intensified. The plan includes follow-up with cardiology after discharge for modification in long-term management  and regular monitoring of her heart function in outpatient service."
15,1,72,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial72,"Presentation of Patient:  Good Morning/Afternoon   Today  I present to you the case of Mrs. Susan Thompson  a 65-year-old African-American female who came to our emergency department yesterday evening  with chief complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath which started about 1.5 hour prior to her presentation.  Mrs. Thompson is a retired school teacher  lives alone  and her son visits her twice a week. She denies any alcohol or drug use but is known to be a pack-a-day smoker for the past 40 years. She is known to have a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes for which she takes Amlodipine 5mg daily and Metformin 500mg twice daily  respectively.  On thorough clinical examination  at presentation  her blood pressure was 170/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and afebrile with temperature 36.7 Degree Celsius. Her body mass index is within the normal range (23 kg/m2) and oxygen saturation is 95% while on room air. There is moderate distress visible related to her chest pain.  She has no family history of cardiovascular disease but does have a significant personal history of chronic stress related to her husband's sudden death a year ago  and is currently undergoing behavioral therapy for grief-related symptoms.  Given her clinical presentation  EKG showing ST elevations and initial cardiac enzymes that are slightly elevated (TnI 0.19 ng/mL)  acute coronary syndrome is considered as one of the differential diagnosis. However  the presentation of her symptoms in the setting of severe emotional stress  lack of significant coronary artery disease on subsequent angiography and peculiar left ventricular dysfunction with ballooning of the apex (seen on echocardiography)  suggests a strong likelihood of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"stress cardiomyopathy"""".  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a relatively rare heart condition often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. Diagnosis demands a high index of clinical suspicion given that it can mimic acute coronary syndrome. This presentation should alert healthcare professionals to consider stress cardiomyopathy in similar clinical scenarios.   Her current treatment is focused on supportive therapy to manage and ultimately alleviate her symptoms. We are also in close collaboration with her family and a multi-disciplinary approach is in process  involving cardiology  internal medicine  and psychiatry team to plan a comprehensive long-term management for Mrs. Thompson."
15,1,73,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial73,Patient Presentation: Ms. Marie Santos  Demographic Information: Ms. Marie Santos  a 65-year-old Filipino woman  retired teacher  single  currently living alone  and non-smoker  residing in San Francisco  California. She has been living a relatively healthy life and exercises regularly. Ms. Santos reports no known allergies.  Medical History: Ms. Santos has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both managed through medical intervention for the past 10 years. Her mother died of myocardial infarction aged 75  and her father had a history of diabetes and stroke. There are no previous records of disability or other major illnesses in Ms. Santos's history. She was recently hospitalized due to the sudden onset of severe chest pain following the death of her brother two weeks ago.  Present Condition: EKG record shows ST-segment elevation consistent with an acute coronary syndrome. However  a detailed examination  including diagnostic angiogram  revealed no coronary artery disease. Instead  a ventriculogram showed the classic 'takotsubo' pattern  with apical ballooning and hypercontraction of the basal segments. The heart's overall systolic function was significantly reduced.   It was determined that Ms. Santos's condition was likely due to 'Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy'  often known as 'Broken Heart Syndrome.' This syndrome often affects postmenopausal women and is usually precipitated by severe emotional stress  as was the case with Ms. Santos's recent loss.   Plan for Management: Ms. Santos will be admitted for cardiac monitoring and commenced on an ACE inhibitor  beta-blocker  and diuretic for the management of the reduced cardiac output. A repeat echocardiogram will be performed in one month to assess for recovery of the left ventricular function. Psychological support will also be offered to help manage her emotional stress  considering the implications it has on her current state of health. With early detection and appropriate medical management  her prognosis is generally favorable.   Additionally  adhering to a balanced diet and regular check-ups for hypertension and hyperlipidemia cannot be emphasized enough  considering that it might have triggered an exaggerated stress response. Lastly  counseling for a stress management program or therapy might serve beneficial for Ms. Santos to handle stress more effectively in the future.
15,1,74,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial74,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who presents with intense chest pain radiating to the left arm  associated with severe shortness of breath and intense fatigue. She describes the pain as severe  pressure-like  and unrelenting  akin to the sensations associated with severe episodes of heartburn. Over the past 72 hours  she reports increased anxiety due to the passing of her spouse.   Demographics: The patient lives alone in a suburban neighborhood and is a retired teacher. She does not smoke tobacco  use illicit drugs  or consume much barbiturate. She drinks socially. The patient has two children  both of whom live out of state.  Past Medical History: The patient's medical history includes well-controlled hypertension for ten years and early-stage breast cancer diagnosed five years ago and in remission. Relevant family history includes a father who died of myocardial infarction at age 70 and a sister with type 2 diabetes.   Current Medications: The patient is currently on Lisinopril for hypertension  and she takes a daily multivitamin.   Physical Examination: On physical exam  the patient appears anxious but in no acute distress. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 155/95 mmHg  a pulse rate of 112 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. On auscultation  her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally  and her heart sounds indicate a regular rhythm without any murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  The presentation of chest pain  history of hypertension  recent severe emotional stress  and elevated blood pressure on physical examination point towards the possible diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy also known as Broken Heart Syndrome. Comprehensive cardiovascular assessment  lab work  and echocardiography are required to confirm this and to rule out acute coronary syndrome.
15,1,75,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial75,Subject: Presentation of a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:   Mrs. Maria Thompson is a 75-year-old Caucasian female with a primary complaint of chest pain. She resides in the suburb of Springfield  is a nonsmoker  and is of low socioeconomic status. She was a secondary school teacher until retiring 10 years ago. Now she enjoys gardening  playing bridge with friends  and doting on her grandchildren. Mrs. Thompson is a widow with two adult children. She experienced the sudden death of her husband six months ago  and since then  has been under substantial emotional strain.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Thompson has a history of hypertension  diagnosed 15 years ago  which is managed with amlodipine 5mg daily. She also has osteoarthritis  managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. Mrs Thompson has no known allergies  no previous surgeries or hospitalisations  and no history of cardiac or thyroid diseases. She suffered from depression shortly after her husband’s death and has been on escitalopram 5mg once daily for the past five months.  Complaint and Symptoms:  Mrs. Thompson presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. Additionally  she also experienced breathlessness and palpitations. The patient reports that these symptoms were precipitated by an argument earlier in the day with a neighbor  which caused her significant distress. She denies any symptoms of a recent infection  such as cough or fever. However  she admits to having intermittent episodes of similar  milder chest pain and emotional stress over the past month.  Given Mrs. Thompson's symptoms  history of hypertension  recent severe emotional stress  and the absence of significant coronary artery disease  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (broken-heart syndrome) should be strongly considered. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy  typically provoked by intense emotional or physical stress  where the heart muscle weakens and subsequently leads to left ventricular dysfunction.  Mrs. Thompson fits the typical demographic for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  namely postmenopausal women with a recent history of severe emotional stress. Further investigations  such as troponin levels  Electrocardiogram  and echocardiography  will be essential to confirm the diagnosis and rule out acute coronary syndrome.
15,1,76,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial76,"Patient Presentation  Patient Information: Ms. Daisy Clark  a 60-year-old Caucasian female  presents to our facility.  Chief Complaint: She reports an abrupt onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm and jaw  accompanied by shortness of breath and a feeling of impending doom.   Past Medical History: Patient has a history of hypertension  managed by ACE inhibitors  and type II diabetes mellitus controlled via oral antidiabetic medication. She additionally suffers from hypercholesterolaemia and is on statins. There is no history of previous cardiovascular diseases  including myocardial infarction or congestive cardiac failure. Ms. Clark is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. The patient has been under significant emotional stress  due to the recent loss of her husband.   Current Medication: Lisinopril 20mg daily  Metformin 1000 mg twice a day  and Atorvastatin 40 mg at bed time.   Family History: Her mother had a myocardial infarction in her 60's and her father had a stroke at the age of 70.  Physical Examination: On examination  Ms. Clark is diaphoretic and in distress. She has a blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg  a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Heart sounds are regular without murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Chest auscultation reveals clear lung fields bilaterally. Rest of the physical examination is noncontributory.   Preliminary Diagnosis: The symptoms suggest possible acute coronary syndrome  but the sudden onset following a stressful event and her typical demographics suggests the possibility of a takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced or """"broken heart"""" syndrome. Further diagnostic tests including cardiac biomarkers and echocardiogram will be ordered to substantiate the diagnosis. The patient will be admitted for observation and further management in light of her presenting symptoms."
15,1,77,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial77,"Subject: 66-Year-Old Caucasian Female with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Presentation: The patient is a 66-year-old Caucasian female. She is a retired school teacher who lives alone  though she is regularly visited by her daughter who lives in the same city. The patient is 5'5"""" and weighs approximately 145 lbs.   The patient reports having been fairly active and in generally good health  although she does have a history of hypertension and high cholesterol for which she takes daily medication - lisinopril 10mg and atorvastatin 20mg respectively. The patient has never smoked and drinks alcohol casually.   Recent Medical History: The patient's medical history was unremarkable until two weeks ago  when she was subjected to a major emotional stress – sudden loss of her brother. Since then  she has experienced severe chest pain and shortness of breath.  Her physician has performed an EKG  chest x-ray  a CT scan  and blood tests  all of which were normal except there were minor changes in the EKG  pointing towards Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""").   Symptoms & Diagnosis: The patient's persistence of chest pain  along with transient apical ballooning on the echocardiogram  led to the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Additionally  the patient's symptoms were unlikely to be related to coronary artery disease given her relatively low-risk profile.   The patient provides a classic case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  presenting with acute onset of chest pain following severe emotional stress  physical signs consistent with heart failure  and the absence of significant coronary artery disease to explain her symptoms.  Treatment & Follow-up: Acute management of the patient included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors) and beta-blockers. The patient will be required to attend regular follow-up appointments for physiologic assessment and to verify the complete resolution of left ventricular dysfunction. It will also be recommended that she seeks counseling or support to manage her emotional stress.   Prevention strategies should be focused on controlling risk factors  including her hypertension and cholesterol  through medication and lifestyle alterations such as regular exercise and a healthier diet. Also  future avoidance of intense emotional stress can help prevent recurrence of this condition.   Conclusion: This patient embodies a typical presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which predominantly affects postmenopausal women and is often triggered by intense physical or emotional stress. Though often self-resolving  the condition may require ongoing management to prevent a recurrence. Studies have shown excellent prognosis if adequately recognized and managed."
15,1,78,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial78,Patient Presentation  I am presenting Mrs. Eileen Nolan  a 64-year-old Caucasian female with a primary diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also commonly known as “broken heart syndrome.” She lives in Albany  New York with her husband of 43 years and was recently retired from her job as a schoolteacher.  Mrs. Nolan has a past medical history that is fairly significant and indicative of chronic stress and anxiety. She was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) a decade ago  and has been on regular medication since then. She was additionally diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago  which has been fairly well managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.  Most recently  Mrs. Nolan experienced the sudden death of her eldest son in a car accident 3 weeks ago  which has served as a significant stressor. After his funeral  she reported symptoms of severe chest pain and shortness of breath  following which she was rushed to the hospital and subsequently diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Mrs. Nolan is a non-smoker but admits to being a moderate drinker over the course of many years. She does not have any reported drug allergies. There is also no known family history of coronary artery disease  heart failure  or sudden cardiac deaths.  In conclusion  with the high-stress event of her son's passing  her medical history of anxiety and hypertension  we suspect that these factors triggered the onset of Mrs. Nolan’s takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The plan moving forward includes both management of her new condition and assistance in managing her emotional and mental health.
15,1,79,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial79,Slide 1: Introduction Our patient today is a 65-year old Caucasian female previously enjoying good health  but recently experienced an extremely stressful life event.   Slide 2: Health History The patient has no past medical history of heart disease  diabetes  or high blood pressure. She is a non-smoker and only consumes alcohol occasionally. Family history reveals her mother has hypertension  but there are no reports of any familial heart diseases.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms A week after her husband’s sudden death  the patient presented with alarming symptoms similar to a heart attack  including severe chest pain and breathlessness. She also reported feelings of extreme anxiety and depression due to her recent bereavement.  Slide 4: Clinical Presentation Physical exam defines her blood pressure at 160/90  heart rate at 90 beats per minute  and O2 saturation at 93% on room air. Her EKG revealed ST-segment changes and her Troponin levels were slightly elevated. However  her coronary angiogram did not exhibit any obstructive coronary disease.  Slide 5: Diagnosis Given the patient's intense emotional stress  symptomatology mimicking myocardial infarction  absence of significant coronary artery disease  and transient wall-motion abnormalities involving the left ventricular apex on echocardiography  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome.  Slide 6: Treatment & Prognosis The initial treatment comprised of relieving the patient's heart failure symptoms with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors  coupled with psychological support for her bereavement. The prognosis for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is generally good  and complete recovery is expected in weeks to months with appropriate medical management and psychological support.  Slide 7: Conclusion This case exemplifies the significant impact of emotional stress on myocardial function  presenting as Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. This condition  although rare  can be life-threatening  thus requiring early recognition and appropriate management.  Slide 8: Q&A Let's take any questions or discussions.
15,1,80,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial80,"Patient Presentation:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 68 year old Caucasian female with a past medical history of hypertension  well-controlled type 2 diabetes  and is post-menopausal.  Clinical Presentation: She presented to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath occurring for 3-4 hours. The chest pain was severe  radiating to her left arm and was associated with profuse sweating.  Relevant Medical History: Her hypertension is controlled with daily medication (Lisinopril) and she has adherence to Metformin for her Type 2 diabetes. She has a 10-year history of smoking but quit 15 years back. She reports no familial history of heart disease.  Recent Stressors: The patient experienced a major emotional stressor one day ago: the sudden passing of her husband. She had been under severe emotional stress since then and admits to difficulty sleeping  lack of appetite and frequent crying spells. The stressor coincided with the timing of her chest pain.  Clinical Examination: She exhibited tachycardia and high blood pressure upon admission. Initial ECG showed ST segment elevation suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. Troponin level was considerably raised. Echo cardiogram showed contractile dysfunction  mainly in the apex of the left ventricle  consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Further Management: After stabilization  she was admitted to the cardiology ward for further management and observation. Cardiac catheterization revealed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease  which further points to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   This clinical picture was suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly known as """"broken heart syndrome """" induced by severe emotional distress."
15,1,81,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial81,Patient Presentation:  Patient Identity: Ms. Barbara Snow Age: 65 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Country of residence: United States Occupation: Retired school teacher Marital Status: Widowed  Presenting Condition: Ms. Snow presents with signs and symptoms suggesting takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   History of presenting condition:   Ms. Snow's symptoms started a week ago with chest pain  breathlessness  palpitation  and excessive fatigue. She recalls experiencing acute emotional stress contributing to her husband's death two months ago. There are no similar episodes in the past. Her chest pain lasting for a few minutes is generally located in the middle of the chest  exertional  and relieved by rest.   Past medical history:  Ms. Snow was in good health until her recent bereavement. She has a past history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which were well-controlled with medication. She does not have a history of ischemic heart disease. She denies any major surgical procedures and has no known allergies.  Family history:   No history of premature cardiovascular disease and sudden cardiac death. However  her mother had type 2 DM and HTN  and her father had died of old-age-related diseases.  Social History:  Ms. Snow is a non-smoker and has no history of substance or alcohol abuse. She was physically active and maintained a balanced diet before her husband's passing. Recently  however  she has been relatively inactive due to emotional distress.  Currently  Ms. Snow lives alone  and reports having a strong emotional and logistical support network  including her daughter's family living nearby and her circle of friends.  Summary:  Ms. Barbara Snow  a 65-year-old retired schoolteacher widow with a history of hypertension and diabetic  has recently presented with chest pain  breathlessness  palpitation  and excessive fatigue following a major emotional stressor  pointing to a potential incident of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. 
15,1,82,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial82,"Patient Presentation  Patient's Demographics: We present the case of Mrs. J  a 68-year-old Caucasian female from rural Nebraska. She is retired  a widow  and lives alone. She does not smoke  with a body mass index (BMI) of 27  denoting that she is slightly overweight.   Medical History: Mrs. J has a past medical history significant for hypertension (HTN) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) for the past ten years  managed with hydrochlorothiazide and diazepam respectively. She also has osteoarthritis with occasional pain relief medications but no history of diabetes  dyslipidemia  or any known cardiovascular disease in the past. She reported no known drug allergies during previous consultations.  Present Illness: Her grandson found her at home  in acute distress with a complaint of sudden  severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. The pain started approximately two hours earlier after she received the news about her sister's unexpected death. Given her age and symptoms  myocardial infarction was initially suspected  and she was transported to the Emergency Department.  On arrival  her vitals were as follow: BP 155/90 mmHg  Pulse rate 110/min  respiratory rate 22/min  temperature 98.6 ˚F  and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed unusual ST-segment elevations  and lab tests showed mildly elevated cardiac troponins. No significant occlusion was found on coronary angiography. Echocardiography showed typical apical ballooning with reduced ejection fraction  suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TC). She was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit  where her symptoms were managed conservatively.  In Conclusion: Mrs. J's case is consistent with TC  often triggered by emotional stress and presenting similarly to an acute coronary syndrome. TC or """"broken heart syndrome"""" predominantly affects postmenopausal women  as exemplified in Mrs. J's case. Her major risk factors include her postmenopausal status  history of GAD  and the acute emotional stress of her sister's death. Prompt recognition and supportive treatment are key to a positive prognosis."

15,1,84,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial84,Patient Presentation:  Good day ladies and gentlemen  today we have a case of Mrs. Kimura  a 68-year-old Japanese woman who presented with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. She is a widow  has two grown children and lives alone. She is retired and has been living a socially isolated life.  Past Medical History:  She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. She doesn't have a personal past medical history of hypertension  diabetes mellitus  dyslipidemia  heart disease  or other cardiovascular risk factors. Family history is unremarkable for early heart disease or sudden death.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mrs. Kimura experienced an abrupt episode of severe chest pain and shortness of breath after receiving the news of her only brother's sudden death. She was brought into the emergency department of our hospital with these complaints. She showed signs of distress  emotional upset and anxiety.  Clinical Examination:  Her vital signs upon arrival were Blood Pressure: 130/85mmHg  Heart Rate: 110 beats/minute  Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths/minute and SpO2: 98% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed normal S1 and S2 without any added sounds. Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.  Given the clinical presentation and her recent emotional stress  we suspected a case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'. To confirm this  we decided to further investigate with additional laboratory tests and imaging studies. Moving forward  we will need to closely monitor Mrs. Kimura and provide her with the necessary emotional and medical support.

She has no major surgeries and no known allergies. However  her family history reveals cardiac disease on her mother's side with both her maternal grandparents and mother experiencing heart-related conditions. Her only regimen is a daily multivitamin  and she is not currently on any prescription medications. She is moderately active and her diet is generally healthy with a focus on whole grains  vegetables  and lean proteins.  Presenting Condition:  Mrs. Henry presents with acute onset chest discomfort combined with shortness of breath  which began suddenly after receiving the news of her elder brother’s sudden passing. She had a resting blood pressure of 140/95 mmHg and a heart rate of 90 bpm. It was noted that she showed signs of mild anxiety and distress.   After swift admittance to the ER  EKG results revealed ST-segment elevations  while lab results revealed increased cardiac enzymes. The immediate suspicion was Myocardial Infarction. However  an emergency coronary angiogram revealed no evidence of coronary obstruction  suggesting a different diagnosis.  Based on her recent emotional trauma  her symptomatic presentation  and the results from the angiogram  Mrs. Henry was ultimately diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""". This condition  often induced by extreme stress  presents like a heart attack  but is the result of a temporary disruption in the heart's pumping function while the remainder of the heart continues to function normally or with even more forceful contractions.   To summarize  this presentation described a case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy that offers a clear demonstration of the ways in which intense emotional stress can result in significant cardiac symptoms and the importance of a thorough patient history and diagnostic imaging in formulating a precise diagnosis.  This also provided a potent reminder that despite being previously healthy  acute emotional stress could potentially present severe physiological responses  particularly concerning the cardiovascular system."
15,1,86,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial86,Patient Presentation:  I am presenting a case of a 65-year-old Caucasian female  who has been diagnosed with a medical condition named Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome'. She is a retired principal  widowed for 3 years  and lives with her daughter and grandchildren. She has been previously diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and she is a nonsmoker. She quit drinking alcohol 5 years ago. There is a family history of coronary artery disease; her father had a myocardial infarction at age 64 and mother had chronic heart failure.  Her presenting complaint is severe  acute chest pain which she rated as 10 on a scale of 0-10  along with mild shortness of breath after receiving sudden  shocking news about the death of a very close friend  which she found extremely distressing. She states that the pain radiates to the left upper limb and neck region  which mimics the symptoms of a heart attack. However  there is no actual heart damage or changes usually associated with a heart attack. Her blood pressure was elevated at 180/100 mmHg  heart rate was 110 beats per minute and blood tests revealed slightly elevated cardiac enzymes. An EKG showed T-wave inversion but no ST-segment elevation.  After these initial findings  further cardiac testing was ordered. Echocardiography and ventriculography confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  revealing apical ballooning and contraction abnormalities implicating a stress cardiomyopathy  and a lack of coronary artery obstruction which effectively ruled out a heart attack.   Her past medical history which includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  along with her acute emotional stress could have potentially contributed to this condition. To conclude  her physical examination  lab tests  and imaging studies confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Her treatment is being planned accordingly  but she will need careful long-term management with a focus on stress management and treating her pre-existing conditions. 
15,1,87,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial87,Patient Presentation:   Patient is a 66-year-old female  who presented to the emergency room with acute complaint of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm. The pain started suddenly two days ago and was perceived as a heavy  squeezing sensation. She describes the episode as related to intense psychological stress due to the recent death of her husband.  Demographic Information:  The patient is a Hispanic female  born and raised in Texas. She's retired and was a school teacher. She is a widow and lives alone  but close to her two daughters. She is a non-smoker  a social drinker and is not involved in any substance abuse. Her diet consists of home-cooked meals and she exercises moderately  typically going for a brisk walk every day.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension  controlled through medication  diagnosed about 10 years ago. She also has hyperlipidemia and is on a low-dose statin. She has no prior cardiac history and no family history of cardiovascular disease. She is on oral medication for type 2 diabetes and has suffered from moderate anxiety disorder. She had a hysterectomy about 20 years ago due to fibroids. She reports no allergies to medications nor any prior surgeries other than the hysterectomy.   Current medications: Lisinopril for hypertension  Metformin for type 2 diabetes  and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.   Based on her symptoms  EKG changes  elevated cardiac enzymes  and the presence of left ventricular ballooning on echocardiography  she was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Given her recent bereavement  this may have been the trigger for this stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Patient was stabilized and managed conservatively with medications and was advised to undergo a supervised cardiac rehabilitation program.

Current Clinical Presentation:  The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  which began earlier the same day. The pain was described as a heaviness in the center of her chest. Upon questioning  she reported that the pain did not radiate and was not associated with physical exertion or meals. Further  the patient mentioned she was feeling unusually stressed due to a recent family bereavement.   The initial electrocardiogram revealed non-specific ST-segment changes and her troponin levels were elevated  indicative of acute myocardial injury. The patient was admitted to the hospital for monitoring and further diagnostic evaluation.  Her subsequent echocardiogram showed a classic signs of apical ballooning and relatively preserved basal function  characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. We ruled out an acute coronary syndrome as her coronary angiography was normal  confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Management comprises of supportive care while regular follow-up appointments have been arranged to monitor her recovery and to adjust her medications. Referral to a psychologist has also been placed due to the precipitant seeming to be emotional stress."
15,1,89,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial89,Patient Presentation:  The patient we're discussing today is Ms. Donna Craig  a 65-year-old Caucasian female who resides at 1978 Fairview Avenue. She is a retired primary school teacher  living alone following her husband's passing 8 years ago. She is non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She has a BMI of 22 indicating a healthy weight range. She is fluent in English and has no disability.   Her past medical history includes: 1. Type-II Diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago  well controlled via oral hypoglycemics. 2. Hypertension for the past 8 years  managed with lifestyle modification and medication. 3. She successfully underwent right knee arthroscopy 5 years ago and made a complete recovery. 4. Menopause at 54 years old  occasionally takes hormone replacement therapy. 5. Currently she has no known drug allergies.  Recently  Ms. Craig presented with chest pain and dyspnea following a high-stress event. On evaluation  her EKG showed ST-elevations  and her troponin levels were elevated  all indicative of an acute coronary syndrome. However  a coronary angiogram was done which showed no significant obstruction. But the left ventriculogram demonstrated an unusual pattern suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome)  with apical ballooning and preserved basal function.  Initial diagnosis is supported by a lack of angiographic evidence of acute plaque rupture. Further  disproportionally modest increase in cardiac troponin alongside her recent emotional stress also strengthen the early diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   Further diagnostics and appropriate treatment plan is being proposed to the patient to help manage her condition.
15,1,90,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial90,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mrs. Beatrice Clark Age: 75 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian  Mrs. Beatrice Clark is a 75-year-old Caucasian woman  retired school teacher  and a non-smoker  who initially presented to our medical center with intense chest pain following an emotionally stressful event involving the death of her spouse.   Past Medical History:   Mrs. Clark has a known history of hypertension  which has been managed with lisinopril 20 mg daily for the last 10 years. She also has a history of hyperlipidemia  controlled well with 40 mg of atorvastatin daily. Mrs. Clark has a presence of osteoarthritis and is occasionally taking ibuprofen as needed. She has a notable absence of diabetes mellitus and any known heart diseases in her medical past.   In addition  she was screened for breast cancer annually and was negative to date. She has no known allergies to any medications. Mrs. Clark is moderately active  takes daily walks and does garden work at her home. Her alcohol intake is limited to occasional glasses of wine during social events  and she has a balanced diet.  Based on the recent onset of the symptoms following a significant emotional event and an absence of coronary artery disease  she has been diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome. Her emotional stress may have been a trigger leading to changes in heart muscle cells or coronary blood vessels  or both. The pattern of left ventricular dysfunction seen on echocardiogram is consistent with this diagnosis. Efforts will be taken to manage her symptoms and underlying emotional stress  and to prevent any complications like heart failure or serious arrhythmias.   In conclusion  early identification of this condition is crucial as most patients recover fully within days to weeks if provided with appropriate care and management. 
15,1,91,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial91,"Patient Presentation  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who presents with symptoms similar to an acute myocardial infarction. The symptoms came on suddenly immediately following the unexpected death of her husband. She reported feelings of severe chest pain and shortness of breath and her EKG suggested acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. However  the cardiac biomarkers were only moderately elevated showing a discordant EKG/Marcum ratio prompting a further evaluation leading to diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""".  The patient has a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She also exhibited intermittent asthmatic symptoms  which are managed through a combination of rescue and maintenance inhalers. She follows a healthy eating plan  does light physical exercise on a regular basis  and has a moderate alcohol intake. She has never smoked and there is no family history of heart disease.  Upon further investigation  the patient admitted she had been experiencing heightened stress and anxiety due to her husband's illness and subsequent sudden passing. She has two adult children and lives in a suburban neighborhood. She retired five years ago from a managerial position in a well-known corporation. She has a strong community and familial support system.  Further echocardiography confirmed the expected findings of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  with apical ballooning of the left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction. The patient was treated accordingly  with Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors  and is being closely monitored in the hospital till the condition stabilizes.   Additionally  we will arrange for counseling and support to help her manage the recent emotional stress. Such supportive therapies  in conjunction with medical treatments  have been shown to improve outcomes and reduce future recurrence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy."

Pain started abruptly a couple of hours ago. She is a non-smoker and maintains a healthy diet.   Medical History: Ms. Miller has been generally healthy throughout her life  with only a primary history of hypertension controlled with medication. She reports being under an extreme amount of stress lately due to a recent personal loss - her husband's death two months ago. She states she has been experiencing occasional palpitations but did not seek medical attention as she attributed them to her stress and grief.  Clinical Manifestations: Upon admission  Ms. Miller is in apparent discomfort. She describes her chest pain as severe  left-sided  and crushing in nature. The pain is positional and does not decrease with rest. Additional symptoms include shortness of breath  weakness  and profuse sweating.   Mental Health: Further exploration of the patient's emotional health reveals she is experiencing severe psychological stress  suffering from significant anxiety and panic attacks  all symptoms of acute stress disorder following her loss.  Summary: The above symptoms and the patient's sudden onset of chest pain amidst high levels of emotional stress  point towards the possible diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome."""" This condition often mimics symptoms of a heart attack and is known to occur as a result of severe stress or emotional trauma. It will be crucial to rule out coronary artery disease with further testing such as an electrocardiogram  echo  and cardiac enzymes. The patient will also benefit from a psychological consultation considering the levels of stress and anxiety reported."
15,1,93,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial93,"Patient Presentation  We are discussing the case of Mrs. Verona  a 69-year-old female of Asian descent  who is presenting with clinical signs consistent with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She is a retired school teacher  has been widowed for two years  and currently lives alone.   From her medical history  it should be noted that Mrs. Verona has a known history of anxiety disorder and hypertension  for which she takes prescribed medications. This includes amlodipine 5mg daily and an as-needed hydroxyzine prescription. No known allergies to medications are documented. Her past surgical history is notable for a cholecystectomy 15 years ago. Mrs. Verona quit smoking 20 years ago. Additionally  there is no recorded history or familial history of heart disease.   Prior to this hospitalization  Mrs. Verona was last seen by her primary care physician 6 months ago for a routine check-up. At that time  her hypertension was well-controlled and she was up-to-date on all recommended health screenings for her age.   Mrs. Verona presents today with symptoms onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath  initially suspected as acute coronary syndrome. However  upon further investigation  her EKG and cardiac catheterization findings show abnormalities more consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""".   In conclusion  the sudden intense stress and emotional trauma of losing her husband  her previous anxiety disorder  coupled with her sex and age  are likely contributory factors to her present condition of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
15,1,94,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial94,Patient Presentation  Name: Iris Thompson Age: 64 Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Presenting Complaint:  Ms. Thompson presents with sudden  severe chest pain that started immediately after receiving devastating news about the passing of a loved friend. She explains that the chest pain felt like a blunt force assurance on the center of her chest and radiated towards her left arm  resembling symptoms she generally associates with a heart attack  despite never experiencing one. She also reports feeling light-headed  short of breath  and experiencing a sensation of impending doom. The pain did not alleviate when she rested but eventually eased later in the day.  Past Medical History:  Ms. Thompson has a history of hypertension for which she takes Metoprolol and has a BMI within the overweight range  but otherwise has no other significant health issues. She is a former smoker but quit 10 years back. There is a history of coronary heart disease on her father's side. Her blood pressure and cholesterol levels are usually well-controlled with medication. She has no personal history of angina  myocardial infarction  or any other heart diseases.  Emergency response:  Given her clinical manifestation  an acute myocardial infarction was initially suspected  but further testing including EKG and cardiac biochemical markers suggested irregularities in her left ventricle without severe coronary artery disease – a classic presentation for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  commonly known as 'broken heart syndrome'.  Conclusion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a temporary heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations  like the death of a loved one. Although Ms. Thompson's clinical presentation initially indicated a possible heart attack  her history of recent severe emotional stress and specific diagnostic inconsistencies pointed towards Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Further treatment and management of Ms. Thompson's condition will aim to manage her symptoms and mitigate the effects of her disease.

15,1,97,diagnosis15-prompt1-trial97,Patient Presentation:  I present to you a 72-year-old female patient named Mrs. Sullivan. She is a Caucasian from Austin  Texas. She has been living an active lifestyle all her life  currently residing with her spouse and enjoying a post-retirement life. She is a non-smoker and refrains from alcohol consumption.   Her past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which have been controlled with medication for the last ten years. She also has a history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes.  Today  she presents with a sudden onset of severe chest pain that started an hour ago. She describes it as a crushing sensation which radiates to her left arm. She also reports feelings of nausea and light-headedness. This episode came during a period of intense emotional stress due to the recent passing of her sister.   Given the clinical features and her recent emotional stress  she has been provisionally diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  often referred to as 'broken heart syndrome'. This is a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in which there is a sudden temporary weakening of the muscular portion of the heart  leading to heart failure with symptoms similar to a heart attack.   Current treatment plan aims at relieving her symptoms and preventing complications using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta blockers  and diuretics while assessing for any possible psychosocial interventions to manage her emotional stress.  In conclusion  with appropriate treatment and stress management strategies  the prognosis for Mrs. Sullivan is expected to be generally good as recovery is usually complete within a few weeks to months.

She has been experiencing these symptoms since morning  which she initially brushed off as a consequence of her active lifestyle and attributed to the recent death of her husband  considering its emotional impact.  History: She has a known medical history of controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past ten years. She reports that she quit smoking fifteen years back and drinks alcohol occasionally. She is currently on antihypertensive (Lisinopril) and cholesterol-lowering medications (Atorvastatin).   The patient also has a history of severe anxiety disorder and has been under treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Escitalopram) for more than eight years. This is her first encounter with such intense chest pain.  Diagnostic Imaging and EKG: An echocardiogram revealed akinesis of the mid-ventricular and apical segments with preserved function at the base  commonly known as """"apical ballooning""""  suggesting a potential diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. EKG shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads concerning for acute coronary syndrome.  Given her recent emotional trauma  coupled with severe anxiety  her symptoms and the diagnostic findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Ms. Morgan's case is an example of how mental health conditions and excessive stress can present themselves with the symptoms of a heart attack. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing and managing emotional stress and anxiety  alongside hypertension and hyperlipidemia  as significant factors in cardiovascular health.  The patient will need further evaluation to confirm this diagnosis.

Other than these  she has no history of any cardiovascular diseases  diabetes  or any major surgeries. Her records show no history of smoking or alcohol abuse. With a low-daily-activity lifestyle  she is moderately physically inactive.  The characteristic symptom of heart attack-like chest pain rose abruptly after she got the news of her eldest son's tragic sudden demise yesterday evening  which created a tremendous emotional stress and shock. She was hasty to visiting the emergency services considering the severity of the pain.  On admission  a rapid EKG was performed which revealed ST-segment elevation suggestive of a heart attack. An urgent coronary angiogram was done which showed that her coronary arteries were free of blockages. Ultrasound of her heart revealed an abnormal movement in the mid and apical segments of the left ventricle  creating a balloon-like appearance.   Following these results  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or """"Broken Heart Syndrome""""  a temporary cardiac condition often caused by intense emotional or physical stress. Mrs. Garcia has been admitted for further monitoring and supportive care including medications to manage her pain and vitals.

The onset of these symptoms occurred abruptly this morning  after she received news of her sister's sudden death. She rates her chest pain as an 8 on a scale of 10  describing it as a crushing sensation radiating to her left arm and jaw  similar to her past myocardial infarction.  Demographic Information:  Mrs. Smith is a retired primary school teacher. She lives with her husband in their private house  and they have two adult children who live out of town. She has a 20-pack-year smoking history but quit about ten years ago. She consumes alcohol occasionally and denies any illicit drug use. She reports an active lifestyle  with daily morning walks and light yoga exercises.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Smith had a Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) five years ago  for which she underwent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) and was started on Aspirin  Beta-blockers  Statins  and ACE inhibitors  which she is taking regularly.   She also has well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes diagnosed ten years ago and currently controlled with metformin. Mrs. Smith has no known allergies. Her family history is significant with her father and a brother dying of myocardial infarction at the ages of 68 and 62  respectively.   The patient’s symptoms  combined with her previous history of coronary artery disease  initially suggest acute coronary syndrome. However  the sudden emotional stress she experienced this morning and her demographic profile raise the suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  given that it commonly presents in postmenopausal women following severe physical or emotional stress. Early recognition and supportive treatment for this transient  non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy are critical to a positive prognosis.

The pain surfaced this morning  extreme enough that it woke her from sleep  and has been persistent since then. She also reports a feeling of impending doom.  History of Present Illness:   Mrs. Bloomfield lost her husband of nearly 40 years about a month ago. She has been dealing with severe emotional distress since then.   Vitals:   Blood Pressure: 150/90 mm Hg Pulse: 110 bpm (irregular) Respiration: 24 breaths/minute Temperature: 98.2 F  Clinical Finding:   On examination  mild pedal edema is noticed. Heart sounds reveal an early systolic murmur.  Investigation and Diagnosis:  Her initial EKG shows ST elevation in the precordial leads. Bloodworks reveal slightly raised Troponin I level. Considering her ongoing stress  along with her presenting symptoms and findings  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as 'Broken Heart Syndrome') after confirming with an echocardiogram showing apical ballooning of the left ventricle.  Treatment:   A plan is made to manage her hypertension better along with the provision of supportive care and regular follow-ups. A referral is also made for a grief counselor to help her cope with the emotional distress.

Symptoms:  She reports the symptoms began suddenly during her husband's funeral two days ago and persisted since. The chest pain is central  heavy in nature  radiating towards her left arm. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea have also been reported  and she has been increasingly fatigued since the symptoms began.  Past Medical History:  Ms. Johnson's medical history consists of well-controlled hypertension  treated with Lisinopril  and a depressive disorder managed with sertraline. She has no personal or family history of heart diseases. She does not drink  smoke  or use any recreational drugs.   Physical Findings:  On physical examination  she has a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rhythm with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Pulmonary examination is significant for bilateral crackles halfway up both lung fields.   Investigations:  Preliminary blood tests are positive for elevated troponin levels  and an EKG shows ST-elevation in the anterior leads consistent with an anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  subsequent coronary angiogram is negative for coronary artery disease. Echocardiogram  however  shows apical ballooning and contraction abnormalities suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Patient is admitted to the cardiac care unit and is managed supportively for heart failure symptoms. A follow-up appointment is made for a repeat echocardiogram in 2 months to evaluate the resolution of her myocardial dysfunction.
15,2,43,diagnosis15-prompt2-trial43,A 68-year-old widowed Caucasian female with a history of chronic generalized anxiety disorder and hypothyroidism presents to the emergency room. Her chief complaints are sudden onset of intense chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations that began a few hours following the news of her daughter's fatal car accident.  Her symptoms began acutely and she reported severe  crushing chest pain that radiated to her left arm. She denied any dizziness  syncope  or fatigue.  Her current medications include levothyroxine 50 mcg once daily for hypothyroidism and escitalopram 10 mg daily for anxiety. She has no known drug allergies. She is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol.  Family history is significant for cardiovascular disease in her father and brother.  On examination  she appears visibly distressed and diaphoretic. Vitals include a blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats/minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute  oxygen saturation of 94% on room air  and a temperature of 37.1 °C (98.8 °F).  Given her clinical presentation with a significant psychological stressor and her symptomatic presentation highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was suspected. EKG  cardiac enzymes  and an echocardiogram were ordered. Her EKG results revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  raising suspicion for myocardial infarction  but her cardiac enzyme levels were found to be only mildly elevated. The echocardiogram showed a typical pattern for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  with the characteristic apical ballooning and hyperkinesia of the basal segments.  Further diagnostic tests include coronary angiogram  which ruled out significant coronary artery disease  thus supporting the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She was admitted to the hospital for management and monitoring.
15,2,44,diagnosis15-prompt2-trial44,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath that started 1 hour ago. The pain is described as a heavy sensation in the middle of her chest which made her feel uncomfortable. She rates the pain as 8/10 on the pain scale. The patient also reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing nausea. She mentions these symptoms began suddenly after she received news of her husband's unexpected passing yesterday evening.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension for ten years controlled with lisinopril. She has no previous history of cardiac disease  lipid disorders  or diabetes. She does not smoke  drink alcohol  or use recreational drugs but has a high-stress job as a company executive. She reports rare exercise due to her busy lifestyle.   Family History: She reports a family history of ischemic heart disease. Her father had a myocardial infarction at 55 years of age  and her mother had angina  but no known congenital heart diseases in the family.  Current Medications:  Lisinopril 10mg once daily for hypertension. No known drug allergies.   Social History: The patient is a widow as of yesterday  has 2 children  lives alone  and is retired from a high-stress job.   This patient presentation raises the suspicion of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced (Broken heart syndrome) cardiomyopathy. Given the patient's recent significant emotional stressor  plus her reported symptoms consistent with a heart-related event align with a potential diagnosis of this condition. Further diagnostic studies such as EKG  cardiac enzyme tests  and potentially an echo-cardiogram may be needed to confirm.

She revealed that the chest pain started abruptly during an intense argument with her neighbor. She described the pain as a heavy pressure  rated it as 8 on a scale of 1 to 10  and noted it worsened with deep breathing.   The patient has been single  living alone  just retired from her job as a high school teacher. She admitted to having a history of major depressive disorder and anxiety. She has been generally in good health  was a non-smoker  and did not drink alcohol excessively. With no known allergies to drugs  she was only taking an SSRI for her psychiatric condition. Her mother had a history of heart disease in her later stage of life but there was no other relevant family heart history.  Physical examination found her to be in visible discomfort. Cardiac auscultation revealed tachycardia with no murmur; lung sounds were clear.   This presentation and sequence of events suggest a stress-induced tachycardia  commonly known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""".

The pain started a couple of hours ago and hasn't abated since.  She recently suffered the sudden loss of her husband and reported feeling excessively stressed and overwhelmed since the incident. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and she has been on medication for both. She denies any history of coronary artery disease  diabetes  or smoking.  Vital signs show a rise in the blood pressure and heart rate remarkably. Though her BMI falls within prescribed normal limits  the EKG performed in the emergency department is showing ST-segment elevation. There were no noticeable troponin levels suggesting no myocardial infarction.  The stress echocardiography test showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved function at the base  indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome.  She has no known drug allergies and is compliant with her daily antihypertensive and cholesterol medications. She maintains a well-balanced diet and performs regular exercise. The sudden emotional stress she has been under appears to be the leading cause culminating in this critical cardiac condition.
15,2,50,diagnosis15-prompt2-trial50,Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. She describes the pain as severe  pressure-like  radiating to her left arm and jaw  and it has become progressively worse over the last hour. She further reports episodes of light-headedness and palpitations along with an overall feeling of being unwell. The pain began while she was attending her husband's funeral. She has no known allergies and denies any use of alcohol or illicit drugs.

15,2,80,diagnosis15-prompt2-trial80,Subject is a 68-year-old postmenopausal white female who presents to the emergency department with complaints of a sudden onset of severe retrosternal chest pain radiating to the left upper arm that occurred following the sudden death of her spouse two days ago. Patient characterizes the pain as “crushing” in nature and rating it 8/10 in intensity. Associated symptoms include lightheadedness  diaphoresis  and a feeling of impending doom.   The patient has no history suggestive of ischemic heart disease or diabetes. She has a former smoking history but quit 20 years ago. She has been regularly taking anti-hypertensive medication [lisinopril] and a statin for her hypertension and hypercholesterolemia respectively. She has an allergy to sulfa antibiotics and has had no surgeries in the past. No history of recreational drug use  denies alcohol intake.  Patient is visibly anxious and upset. On physical examination  she has elevated blood pressure of 150/100mmHg and a heart rate of 110 beats per minute - suggestive of some stress. Cardiovascular exam reveals a faint systolic murmur  lungs are clear  and no dyspnea is noted.  ECG and Troponin T results suggest acute coronary syndrome but coronary angiography is not suggestive of significant coronary artery disease. Left ventriculography reveals an apical ballooning pattern with basal hypermobility suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

15,2,81,diagnosis15-prompt2-trial81,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Johnson is a 72-year-old Caucasian female presenting with severe chest pain that radiates to the jaw and left arm. She describes the pain as a heavy pressure  rating it 7 out of 10 on the pain scale. She reports increasing severity of symptoms over the past few hours. The patient also describes shortness of breath  lightheadedness  and nausea.  The patient is a widow and a retired teacher living alone with her pet dog. She lost her husband 5 months ago and has been under immense psychological stress since then. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both of which are well-controlled with medication. She denies smoking and alcohol use but admits to a relatively sedentary lifestyle.  Ms. Johnson’s vitals upon arrival are as follows: BP 165/95 mmHg  pulse of 110 bpm  and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Physical examination shows mild jugular venous distension  cold extremities  and slightly irregular heart sounds.  Initial EKG shows ST elevations in leads II  III  and aVF and troponin I levels are elevated at 0.8 ng/mL. These findings strongly suggest an acute myocardial infarction. However  given the presence of severe ongoing stress  absence of significant coronary artery disease history  and the slightly atypical nature of her EKG  the clinical suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is high.  Confirmation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy will require further evaluation with an echocardiogram  showing characteristic left ventricular apical ballooning  and potentially a cardiac catheterization to rule out critical coronary artery disease.

15,3,2,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial2,Slide 1: Introduction  Today  we will be discussing a case about a unique cardiac disorder  known as Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also colloquially referred to as Broken Heart Syndrome.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics   Our patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian female named Mary  who was recently widowed following her husband's sudden demise.  Slide 3: Medical History  Prior to her current situation  Mary possessed a relatively clear medical history. She had well-controlled type-II diabetes and mild hypertension but had no known cardiac-related issues or family history of heart disease.  Slide 4: Presentation  Mary complained of chest pain  shortness of breath  nausea  and was rushed to the ER  as these symptoms mimicked those of an acute coronary syndrome (heart attack).   Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings  After conducting an electrocardiogram (ECG)  mild ST-segment elevation was detected. However  subsequent coronary angiography reflected no obstructive coronary disease (a common finding in classical heart attacks).   Slide 6: Final Diagnosis   Given Mary’s recent bereavement and the diagnostic findings  stress-induced TTC was the most likely diagnosis. Her physical symptoms are believed to be a bodily reaction to the severe emotional distress she's been experiencing.  Slide 7: Treatment and Prognosis   Mary was admitted for monitoring and heart failure management. She was prescribed beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and diuretics. The prognosis of TTC is generally good  with most patients making a complete recovery within weeks to months.  Slide 8: Summary  In this case  it's vital to highlight the importance of understanding the patient's social and personal circumstances  as they may directly influence their physical health  just as it happened through 'Broken Heart Syndrome' in our patient  Mary.   Slide 9: Conclusion   In conclusion  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is an interesting cardiac presentation that may mimic more common cardiac issues. A thorough understanding of the condition and its triggers can help guide accurate diagnosis and treatment. This case illustrates that thorough medical histories  including psychosocial factors  are imperative in diagnosis and treatment.
15,3,3,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial3,Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TC)  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a transient heart condition often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress. Here  we discuss a representative case to deepen our understanding.  Slide 2: Demographics The patient is a 63-year-old  Caucasian female  recent retiree  living with her husband in a suburban setting.   Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient comes with a significant past medical history that includes hypertension  type II diabetes  and depression. She has been managing her conditions with medications and lifestyle modifications.   Slide 4: Presenting Complaints The patient was brought to the emergency room experiencing severe chest pain and shortness of breath. These symptoms began suddenly after she received news of her brother's untimely death.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Tests and Findings An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment elevation  but a subsequent cardiac catheterization ruled out occlusive coronary disease. The left ventriculography revealed apical ballooning with strong contraction of the base that is typical of TC. The troponin levels were disproportionately low for the degree of wall motion abnormalities on the echocardiogram.  Slide 6: Diagnosis Based on presenting symptoms  diagnostic results  and subsequent findings  the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Management and Outcome The patient was managed with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and supportive care. She was also advised to start counseling sessions to help her cope with her extreme emotional stress. With this treatment regimen  her symptoms subsided  and ventricular function normalized within six weeks  indicating recovery.  Slide 8: Discussion This case underlines that extreme emotional experiences can result in TC even without previously diagnosed heart disease. Thus  comprehensive medical histories and prompt  comprehensive diagnostic measures are fundamental when patients present with acute chest pain and breathing difficulties.  Slide 9: Conclusion TC  while usually reversible  demands critical diagnosis and intervention. It emphasizes the intricate connection between emotional well-being and physical health  highlighting the importance of psychological care in managing medical conditions.

15,3,6,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial6,"Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction  - Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also referred to as """"broken heart syndrome """" is a disease characterized by acute  transient  and severe heart dysfunction triggered by severe emotional or physical stress.    Slide 2: Patient Demographics  - Our patient today is a 65-year-old postmenopausal woman presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain following the sudden death of her husband.    Slide 3: Past Medical History   - Aside from slightly elevated blood pressure and cholesterol levels diagnosed two years prior  the patient's medical history was relatively unremarkable  with no instances of heart disease in her family. She doesn't smoke or consume excess alcohol and follows a balanced diet.  Slide 4: Summary of Present Illness  - The patient described her chest pain as sharp  localized in the central and left regions  induced by stress  with no radiation. ECG exhibited ST-segment elevation  but blood tests revealed modest elevation of cardiac troponin due to microvascular spasm  suggesting myocardial injury behind her chest pain.   Slide 5: Clinical Findings   - Echocardiography revealed significant hypokinesis in the mid-segments and hyperkinesis in the apical and basal segments of the left ventricle. Coronary angiography exhibited no significant stenosis or plaque rupture. The left ventriculogram demonstrated apical ballooning and the classic takotsubo or 'octopus trap' shape.   Slide 6: Diagnosis and Course of Illness  - Based on her symptoms  examination findings  and the severe emotional stress she experienced  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her symptoms and ventricular dysfunction improved dramatically with supportive care within a few days  confirming the diagnosis.  Slide 7: Conclusion  - This case highlights the critical role of emotional stress in inducing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the importance of considering this diagnosis in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome-like symptoms following a stressful event. Medical therapy and reassurance are the mainstay treatment  and the prognosis is usually excellent with appropriate care.   Slide 8: Discussion   - Emphasize the need for healthcare providers to recognize this condition as a differential diagnosis for acute coronary syndrome  especially in postmenopausal women under severe emotional stress. This discussion promotes the understanding and management of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."

15,3,15,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial15,Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TC)  also known as “Broken Heart Syndrome ” is a transient syndrome that mimics acute coronary syndrome and it characterized by acute left ventricular dysfunction.  Slide 2: Patient Description  Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  recently retired school teacher. Lives by herself after the recent passing of her husband.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms  The patient presented to emergency with sudden onset of severe chest pain  which started after receiving news about a family relative's death. She also complains of shortness of breath.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  The patient was previously healthy  with only hypertension and high cholesterol  which were well controlled by medication. Non-smoker and has no history of drug or alcohol abuse.  Slide 5: Physical Examination  On examination  patient had tachycardia and was in mild distress. Examination of her cardiovascular system revealed elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Rest of her exam was normal.  Slide 6: Initial Investigations  Initial electrocardiograph revealed ST-elevation which raised a suspicion of an acute coronary syndrome  provoked an urgent coronary angiography. But instead of showing blocked arteries  the angiogram showed left ventricular apical ballooning - a hallmark of TC.  Slide 7: Diagnosis  Based on the clinical presentation  modifications to her biomarkers  and characteristic apical ballooning pattern on angiography  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 8: Treatment & Management  Treatment includes managing symptoms with heart failure medications  treating the underlying stressor  and regular follow-ups. She was started on ACE inhibitors  Beta Blockers and given counselling to manage the emotional stress.  Slide 9: Prognosis Generally  the dysfunction resolves over days to weeks. But in our patient's case  it took nearly 2 months to get back to her baseline cardiac function.  Slide 10: Lessons Learned This case has shown us that emotional stress can sometimes have a profound effect on the heart  leading to TC. It also reiterates the importance of considering alternative diagnoses when clinical features do not align with the preliminary diagnosis.   Slide 11: Conclusion Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  though temporary and reversible  can lead to serious complications if not recognized early. Management strategies should therefore focus on both physical and emotional well-being.   End of presentation.
15,3,16,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial16,Title: Case Presentation on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or ‘broken heart syndrome’  is a transient heart condition often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress. Despite its reversibility  it mimics symptoms of a heart attack and requires immediate medical attention.  Slide 2: Patient Profile Mr. John Doe  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  presents with acute onset crushing chest pain radiating to his left arm and jaw  accompanied by shortness of breath and fainting. He works as a high-stress corporate executive.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension  controlled with medication. Recently  he suffered an emotional trauma due to the sudden death of his wife. He has a smoking history of 10-pack years but quit smoking 15 years ago. He does not have any known allergies.  Slide 4: Current Symptoms On presenting to the emergency department  his symptoms resemble acute coronary syndrome. Preliminary differential diagnosis revolves around acute myocardial infarction  pulmonary embolism  or acute aortic dissection.   Slide 5: Clinical Examinations & Investigations Apart from elevated heart rate (92 bpm) and blood pressure (152/92 mmHg)  his examination is rather unremarkable. His ECG shows sinus tachycardia and T wave inversion in the precordial leads. Troponin I levels are raised  and echo-cardiogram reveals 'apical ballooning' of the ventricles  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6: Diagnosis Based on these findings  the final diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is affirmed. It is provoked by the synergistic effects of his emotional trauma and an established form of ineffective coping mechanism.  Slide 7: Management & Follow-up Mr. Doe’s plan involves medical management with supportive measures  such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers and diuretics. Owing to his recent emotional trauma  mental health intervention  lifestyle modification  and regular follow-ups are equally essential.  Slide 8: Conclusion Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  though reversible and non-obstructive  can lead to severe cardiac outcomes and requires prompt recognition for timely treatment. It is crucial to identify the potential triggers  including emotional stress  and address them as part of the comprehensive management plan  as seen in Mr. Doe’s case.

15,3,20,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial20,"Slide 1: Introduction Good day everyone  today we will be discussing a case of a patient diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as the """"broken heart syndrome"""".  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female. She is widowed and recently retired as a high school teacher.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She does not smoke nor drink alcohol. She has a family history of cardiovascular diseases.   Slide 4: Chief Complaints  The patient presented with symptoms similar to a heart attack - severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations. However  she had no history of angina. These symptoms started suddenly during a period of extreme emotional stress - she had just lost her only son in a car accident.  Slide 5: Clinical Findings  On examination  the blood pressure was 160/90mmHg  pulse rate was 110 beats per minute. There were pulmonary crackles and an audible S4 gallop. EKG showed ST-segment elevation but no pathological Q waves  mimicking acute myocardial infarction.  Slide 6: Diagnosis and Management An angiogram showed no obstructive coronary artery disease. An MRI revealed swelling and weakening of the left ventricle and “apical ballooning”  confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Treatment for our patient focused on symptom relief which includes ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and anti-anxiety medication.   Slide 7: Prognosis Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is usually reversible with appropriate treatment and psychological support  though it takes weeks to months for recovery.   Slide 8: Conclusion  This case stands as a testament to the strong influence of emotional stress on heart health and presents a unique challenge in the diagnosis being similar to acute myocardial infarction  despite distinct etiologies. Despite its serious initial presentation  the prognosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally excellent with appropriate care and stress management.  "
15,3,21,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial21,Presentation Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: A Case Review  Slide 1: Introduction  Demographics:  - Patient X is a 52-year-old female. - Ethnicity: Caucasian.  - Occupation: Accountant.    Slide 2: Patient's Past Medical History - Non-smoker  moderate weekly alcohol intake. - Family history of hypertension. - Past medical history of managed hypothyroidism and chronic depression. - No history of illicit drug use. - Regular medication: Sertraline  Levothyroxine.  Slide 3: Presenting Issue - Patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. - Pain described as “a heavy crushing sensation” and rated as 8/10. - No history of trauma  recent surgery  or prolonged immobilization.  Slide 4: Examination and Symptoms - On examination: Patient appeared anxious but vitals were stable. - Physical examination: Slight tachycardia but no signs of obvious distress. - ECG demonstrated ST-segment elevation but troponin levels were within the normal range.  Slide 5: Diagnosis - Based on symptoms and risk factors  a differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome was first considered. - However  a subsequent coronary angiogram revealed no obstructive coronary disease. - The specific pattern of left ventricular dysfunction (ballooning of left ventricle)  along with other test results led to the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Slide 6: Discussion - TCM or 'broken heart syndrome' is typically triggered by acute emotional stress and the patient reported a recent bereavement. - It is more commonly seen in post-menopausal women. - Despite similar presenting symptoms  TCM and acute coronary syndrome have different pathophysiological mechanisms.  Slide 7: Management and Prognosis - Patient was managed conservatively with an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker. - Psychotherapy was advised to manage stress levels. - The prognosis for TCM is generally good with most patients fully recovering left ventricular function within 6 weeks.  Slide 8: Conclusion - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is a critical differential in patients presenting with chest pain  especially if they recently experienced acute emotional stress. - Attention to the patient's mental health is crucial in managing and potentially preventing TCM.

She has a history of smoking  high stress  and a generally sedentary lifestyle.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Over the past few years  she has been complaining of fatigue and occasional chest pains  which she mostly attributed to stress  adding that she had undergone a particularly stressful period in her personal life. No previous cardiac disease history or family history of cardiovascular disease were reported.  Slide 4: Presenting Complaint Patient reported to the Emergency Department with acute chest pains  breathlessness  and feelings of impending doom  been persisting for several hours. Symptoms resembled an acute myocardial infarction.  Slide 5: Examination & Diagnosis On further examination via EKG  troponin levels  and echocardiography  these revealed ST-segment elevation  elevated cardiac enzymes  and a contractile dysfunction of the left ventricle indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Slide 6: Management of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Initially  she was managed as an acute coronary syndrome until Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy was confirmed. Stabilizing measures were applied and she was monitored in the Cardiac Care Unit. Patient was prescribed beta-blockers to control heart rate and reduce stress on the heart  as well as ACE inhibitors to decrease the heart's workload and improve its function.  Slide 7: Prognosis and Follow-Up With early and definitive management  prognosis for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is generally good. The patient’s significant stressors were identified and she was referred for professional psychological help. Subsequent follow-ups showed an improvement in her condition and a study of her myocardial functioning showed gradual normalization of the apical contraction abnormality.

15,3,31,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial31,"Title: Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 60-year-old Female  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" is a transient left ventricular dysfunction predominantly affecting postmenopausal women.   Slide 2: Patient Information   Our case involves a 60-year-old Caucasian woman  Mrs. Jane  with a past medical history of major depressive disorder and osteoporosis.   Slide 3: Presentation & Symptoms  Mrs. Jane presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset retrosternal chest pain radiating to her left arm. Accompanying symptoms included shortness of breath  nausea  and cold sweats.  Slide 4: Risk Factors Her history reveals a significant stressful event – the loss of her spouse six months prior. She doesn’t have a history of smoking  diabetes  or any other cardiovascular risk factors  but she is on medication for her depression and osteoporosis.  Slide 5: Clinical Findings On examination  she was hypotensive and tachycardic. An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in anterior leads. Lab results revealed elevated troponin levels.   Slide 6: Diagnosis After stabilizing the patient  a coronary angiogram was done that ruled out coronary artery disease. Left ventriculogram displayed a typical apical ballooning appearance seen in TCM with preserved basal function. These findings  in conjunction with her clinical presentation  led to the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Management Management was supportive  including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. The patient was closely monitored in the cardiology department until her symptoms subsided.  Slide 8: Prognosis & Follow-up With proper management  the patient's outlook is generally positive  as the heart often returns to normal within days to weeks. A follow-up echocardiogram 8 weeks later demonstrated normalization of left ventricular function.  Slide 9: Discussion & Peer Education This case emphasizes the importance of considering TCM in differential diagnoses for acute chest pain  particularly in postmenopausal women faced with significant emotional stressors. We underline the need for a comprehensive medical history review and thorough examination of all potential diagnoses before ruling out TCM.

15,3,34,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial34,Title: Case Review: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Senior Female Patient  Slide 1: Introduction Today  we will examine the case of a 73-year-old female patient diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as Broken Heart Syndrome.  Slide 2: Demographics  The patient is a 73-year-old African American woman  living in an urban environment. She lived alone and is a retired elementary school teacher. Her socio-economic status is mid-class.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient's previous medical history includes controlled hypertension and depression. There is no history of diabetes  cardiovascular diseases  or any other chronic diseases. She has been on a regimen of antihypertensives and antidepressants.  Slide 4: Presenting Problem The patient presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain and shortness of breath. The discomfort began while she was attending her son's wedding  a reportedly stressful event for her.   Slide 5: Diagnosis  Her electrocardiogram revealed ST-segment elevation  and the pattern of the elevation was significant. Initial suspicion was an acute myocardial infarction; however  subsequent blood tests reflected normal troponin levels. An echocardiogram showed apical ballooning and reduced left ventricle function  leading to a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6: Discussion  Our diagnosis was based on the Mayo Clinic criteria for takotsubo cardiomyopathy - transient hypokinesis  akinesis  or dyskinesis of the left ventricular mid segments with or without apical involvement; the absence of obstructive coronary disease or angiographic evidence of acute plaque rupture; new EKG abnormalities or modest troponin elevation; and absence of pheochromocytoma or myocarditis.  Slide 7: Treatment The patient was effectively managed with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and was closely monitored. Psychological counseling was advised to cope with the perceived stress.  Slide 8: Summary Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often incited by intense emotional or physical stress  presents similarly to a myocardial infarction. It’s important for clinicians to recognise the clinical features of this syndrome quickly to administer suitable treatment and prevent unnecessary procedures. The prognosis is typically excellent with appropriate medical management and stress reduction techniques.  Slide 9: Questions & Discussion  (Open floor for any questions or further discussion)
15,3,35,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial35,Slide 1: Introduction Title: Case Presentation - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Slide 2: Demographics Patient Information: Mrs. Elaine Brown  a 68-year-old Caucasian female.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mrs. Brown has a medical history which includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptom While on a call with her grandson  who lives overseas and whom she hadn't heard from in a while  Mrs. Brown experienced a sudden onset of severe chest pain  resembling a heart attack.  Slide 5: EMS Intervention On arrival  the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) found her vitals to be stable  but the severe chest pain persisted. An ECG was performed  it showed significant ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads suggestive of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.  Slide 6: At the Hospital In the Emergency Room  further evaluation and blood work were conducted. The cardiac enzymes  including Troponin I  were elevated.   Slide 7: Diagnosis An urgent coronary angiogram was performed  which surprisingly showed no significant coronary artery disease. The left ventriculogram displayed the typical apical ballooning with base hypercontractility – the classic feature of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as Broken Heart Syndrome).  Slide 8: Discussion Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. The exact cause isn’t known  but it’s thought that a surge of stress hormones  like adrenaline  might temporarily damage the hearts of some people. It was likely her emotional stress from the phone call that triggered her symptoms.  Slide 9: Treatment and Recovery Treatment was supportive  aimed at relieving her symptoms and managing her heart failure. With medical intervention  Mrs. Brown's heart function improved significantly over a few weeks.   Slide 10: Conclusion  In patients presenting with chest pain and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of a heart attack  it's crucial to consider Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis  particularly in postmenopausal women with a recent history of severe emotional or physical stress. Proper diagnosis and understanding of the condition is essential to provide appropriate treatment and improve patient outcomes.

15,3,37,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial37,Title: Case Study: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome is a temporary heart condition triggered frequently by stress or an extremely emotional event. Let's understand this with the help of a patient case study.  Slide 2: Patient Information Our patient is a 65-year-old Hispanic woman  Maria  a recently widowed retired school teacher. She comes in presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Maria has a history of controlled hypertension and was diagnosed with type II diabetes 5 years ago. She does not smoke  does light exercise  and has a balanced diet intake. No history of cardiac disease in the family.   Slide 4: Current Symptoms Two weeks following her husband's sudden demise  Maria began experiencing severe chest pain similar to a heart attack. Symptoms also included acute shortness of breath  palpitation  and mild dizziness.  Slide 5: Medical Examination Electrocardiography (ECG) displayed ST-segment elevation. Blood tests indicated a slight increase in cardiac troponin level. However  coronary angiography did not show any significant blockages that could account for a heart attack.  Slide 6: Diagnosis Based on her symptoms  elevated cardiac enzymes  and the lack of coronary artery blockage  Maria was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Treatment and Prognosis Maria was managed with supportive therapy  including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta blockers  and anticoagulation. She was also suggested to attend grief counselling. The prognosis for patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy is usually favourable with appropriate management.  Slide 8: Key Takeaways Emotional stress and trauma can trigger physical health issues including heart conditions like Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Adequate treatment and emotional support are crucial for patient recovery.  Slide 9: Conclusion This case exemplifies the intricate link between emotional stress and its impact on physical health. Proper identification and stress management as part of treatment paradigms for diseases like Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy are indispensable.

15,3,44,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial44,Title: A Case Presentation on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  I. Introduction  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced or broken heart syndrome  is a sudden and acute form of heart failure that can occur due to intense psychological or physical stress. Today  we present a case of a patient who was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  II. Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 60-year-old woman of Caucasian descent. She is recently widowed and retired from her job as an elementary school teacher. She is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol.   III. Past Medical History  The patient has a relatively unremarkable medical history. She was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago  which has been well-controlled with medication. Apart from that  she maintains a healthy lifestyle with a good diet and regular exercise.   IV. Recent Occurrences  A month ago  the patient tragically lost her husband in a sudden accident. Since then  she has been experiencing bouts of acute chest pain  shortness of breath  and occasional fainting spells. These symptoms persisted despite taking prescribed pain relief medications  leading her to seek medical attention.  V. Diagnostic Evaluation  A physical examination revealed tachycardia and slightly elevated blood pressure. Blood tests showed elevated troponin levels  indicating heart damage. An EKG showed significant ST-segment elevation.   A subsequent echocardiogram demonstrated hypokinesis of the mid-segment and apex of the left ventricle  resulting in a balloon-like appearance  a hallmark feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. An angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease  ruling out myocardial infarction.  VI. Diagnosis  Based on her symptoms  clinical findings  and test results  the final diagnosis was takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This case highlights the significance of emotional stress as a substantial risk factor for this condition.   VII. Management and Prognosis  The patient was treated with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and emotional support  showing improvement over several days. Rest and stress management were advised. Despite the severe initial presentation  patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy generally have good long-term prognosis with emotional counseling and proper medical management.  This case serves as a reminder of the profound effects of psychological stress on physical health and the importance of caring for mental health in patients facing significant life stressors.

15,3,49,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial49,Slide 1: Case Introduction & Demographics  Our patient is Mrs. A  a 67-year-old Japanese woman living in a suburban community. She is a retired school teacher and lives alone following her husband's recent death. She has three adult children regularly checking up on her.   Slide 2: Medical History  Mrs. A maintained regular health checkups with minimal concerns. Her previous diagnoses include hypertension and type II diabetes  both under control with medication. However  she is a non-smoker and has no family history of significant heart disease.   Slide 3: Recent Events  The patient has been in good health until yesterday when she experienced sudden  severe chest pain following an emotional distress – she was informed about her childhood friend's sudden demise.   Slide 4: Symptoms on Arrival & Initial Diagnosis  When she arrived at the Emergency Department  the symptoms were similar to a heart attack - she experienced chest pain  shortness of breath  palpitations  and nausea. Her preliminary EKG indicated abnormal readings  reflecting possible myocardial injury. High levels of cardiac enzymes also supported this.   Slide 5: Further Diagnosis  An echocardiogram revealed a unique contraction pattern. While her base contractive capability was normal  the midsection and the apex of her heart were contracting poorly. The pattern suggested Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or “Broken Heart Syndrome”.  Slide 6: Condition Overview  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is temporary heart dysfunction caused by extreme emotional or physical stress. The heart's main pumping chamber  the left ventricle  changes shape due to this. The condition mimics symptoms of a heart attack. However  there is no actual heart damage  and the patients recover fully over time.  Slide 7: Treatment Plan  Treatment for Takotsubo involves relieving the stress that triggered the event  managing the symptoms  and monitoring the patient's cardiac function. Mrs. A was prescribed Beta blockers and Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to reduce her heart’s workload  and anti-anxiety medications to help manage stress.  Slide 8: Prognosis  Homely and supportive care will help Mrs. A recover entirely within 4-8 weeks. Close follow-up after release is crucial to help her manage her emotions  monitor medication compliance  and ensure total cardiac functional recovery.   Slide 9: Conclusion  This case exhibits the significant impact emotional events can have on physical health  particularly cardiac health in older individuals. It serves as a reminder for clinicians to remain alert to the psychosomatic interplay while managing patients.

15,3,53,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial53,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: A Case Study  I. Introduction  Today  we will be examining an illustrative case of a patient diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a transient heart condition often triggered by severe stress.  II. Patient Demographics Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who resides in an urban setting.  III. Past Medical History The patient had a generally good health record with only minor cases of hypertension and moderate osteoarthritis  both managed by medication. She has no history of smoking  illicit drug use  or alcohol abuse. She was diagnosed with lifelong generalized anxiety disorder managed through psychotherapy and anxiety medications.   IV. Presenting Issue The patient presented with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath. The episode occurred shortly after receiving heartbreaking news about the death of her close friend  pointing towards an emotional trigger.  V. Diagnostic Approach On examination  she was pale and sweaty. Her Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation and her troponin levels were raised. However  subsequent angiography did not reveal obstructive coronary artery disease often associated with these symptoms. Instead  we noted the akinetic apical ballooning of the left ventricle with basal hyperkinesis  typical of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   VI. Final Diagnosis Given these findings  the absence of significant coronary artery disease  and the recent stressor  the patient was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   VII. Treatment She was managed conservatively with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The patient was also recommended for grief counseling to help address the emotional stress that may have contributed to the onset of the condition.   VIII. Prognosis and Follow-up Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is typically reversible and the patient's outlook was optimistic. She was followed for six months  during which her symptoms improved  and her ventricular function returned to normal.   This case clearly underlines the importance of recognizing the relationship and significance of acute emotional stressors as triggers for cardiovascular events like takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Thank you.

15,3,55,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial55,Title: A Case Study on a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1:  Introduction  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is also known as broken heart syndrome. It's a transient cardiac syndrome that features clinical symptoms similar to an acute coronary syndrome  but without the anatomical blockage typically associated with these symptoms.  Slide 2:  Patient Demographics  Our study focuses on a 58-year-old Caucasian female patient  a non-smoker with moderate alcohol use. Her BMI is 26 (falls within the overweight range). She is a post-menopausal woman with a sedentary lifestyle and is currently retired  living with her husband.  Slide 3:  Past Medical History  The patient has a history of hypertension controlled with medication (ACE inhibitors) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her diabetes is moderately controlled with metformin and lifestyle modifications. She was also diagnosed with major depressive disorder following the unexpected loss of her eldest son last year.  Slide 4:  Current Symptoms   Entered the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain  followed by shortness of breath. She also reported experiencing extreme fatigue and fainting spells over the past week.  Slide 5:  Diagnosis  Initial EKG and cardiac biomarkers suggested acute myocardial infarction. However  coronary angiography showed no obstructive coronary disease. Left ventriculography showed apical ballooning with hypercontraction of basal segments  which are typical signs of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her recent bereavement  together with her clinical presentation  suggested a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6:  Management and Prognosis   The patient was managed with heart failure medications  including β-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. As there is a potential connection between Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and stress  she was also referred to mental health professionals for management of her depression and bereavement.   Most patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy recover within weeks to months with appropriate management  though the condition can recur. Medication adherence and emotional support were crucial in her prognosis.  Slide 7: Conclusion  This case illustrates that while Takotsubo cardiomyopathy mimics the clinical presentation of an acute coronary syndrome  it requires a keen diagnostic approach  taking into account the patients' emotional and psychological history.

15,3,58,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial58,Title: A Complex Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: A Clinical Review   Slide 1: Introduction  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly known as broken heart syndrome  is a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy characterized by reversible left ventricular dysfunction. Usually triggered by severe physical or emotional stress  the condition mimics myocardial infarction in terms of symptoms  but notably lacks obstructive coronary disease typical of the latter.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics -Patient X is a 68-year-old Caucasian female. -Occupation: Retired librarian -Social History: Non-smoker  limited alcohol consumption  vegetarian  Slide 3: Past Medical History A closer look at Patient X's medical history indicates: -Previous diagnosis of hypertension for 10 years. -History of hypercholesterolemia -Managed anxiety disorders for 15 years -No family history of heart disease.  Slide 4: Recent Event / Stressor Recently  Patient X lost her spouse of 45 years to lung cancer. The acute emotional distress associated with this loss can potentially trigger Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 5: Presentation Patient X was brought into the ER with chest pain & shortness of breath  symptoms typically reminiscent of an acute coronary syndrome.   Slide 6: Diagnosis An ECG was performed showing ST-segment elevation in anterior leads. Coronary angiography  however  showed no significant stenosis or blockages - a marker of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. An echo showed apical ballooning of left ventricle  providing a visual confirmation for the diagnosis.  Slide 7: Treatment & Management Patient X was treated with supportive care  including ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers to manage the systolic dysfunction and the hypertension. Additionally  the patient is referred to a grief counseling service to help manage the emotional stressor likely responsible for triggering the event.  Slide 8: Prognosis and Follow Up Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is typified by its reversibility. Over the course of several weeks  Patient X's cardiac functions returned to normal. Routine follow up and emotional support therapy was advised to track her recovery and prevent future recurrence.  Slide 9: Conclusion  The case of Patient X serves as a comprehensive study to understand how acute stressors  both emotional and physical  could be potential risk factors for developing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This highlights the importance of integrating psychological care in managing comprehensive cardiovascular health.
15,3,59,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial59,Title: Case Presentation on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Slide 1: Introduction Presenting a case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome. This is a temporary heart condition often brought on by extreme emotional or physical stress  such as losing a loved one or a severe asthma attack.  Slide 2: Demographics The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female  from a low socio-economic background  residing in a suburban area.   Slide 3: Presenting Issue   The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain  primarily central with radiating pain to the left-hand side  alongside shortness of breath. These symptoms started after receiving news of the sudden death of her husband.  Slide 4: Past Medical History The patient has had a past history of hypertension for which she has been on medications for the last 10 years. She quit smoking 20 years ago  and she also has a history of anxiety disorder. Her family history reveals her mother had ischemic heart disease.  Slide 5: Clinical Assessment and Findings On examination  she was distressed and hyperventilating. Her blood pressure was 155/98 mmHg and heart rate was 110/min. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed abnormalities suggestive of an acute heart attack.    Slide 6: Diagnosis  The patient was initially treated for a suspected heart attack. However  further investigations showed no blood clots in the coronary arteries  and a left ventriculogram revealed the classic 'Takotsubo' or 'octopus pot' shape. The complete absence of atherosclerotic disease and presentation following extreme emotional stress led to the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 7: Management The patient was managed with beta-blockers to lower blood pressure and heart rate. Anxiolytic was given to manage her anxiety. Follow-up echocardiograms showed a slow but steady improvement in her left ventricular function. The patient was also referred to grief counselling services to support her emotional well-being.  Slide 8: Discussion This case highlights the significant association of severe emotional distress with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  and the importance of considering this diagnosis in post-menopausal women presenting with symptoms akin to heart attack following a severe emotional trigger.  Slide 9: Summary Despite overlooking overlapping symptoms with acute coronary syndrome  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed with careful consideration of emotional triggers  patient demographics  and specific echocardiographic features  and managed accordingly by treating underlying stress factors and supporting cardiac function.  Slide 10: Questions Open for any queries or discussion.   End of Presentation.

Introduce Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'. It's an acute stress-induced cardiomyopathy that mimics Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)  but usually with no significant coronary artery obstruction on angiography.   Slide 2: Demographics and Past Medical History   - Patient Profile:   - 64-year-old Caucasian female   - Occupation: Retired former school teacher   - Married with 3 children  - Past Medical History:   - Mild Hypertension   - Hyperlipidemia   - No prior heart disease   - Non- smoker   - No significant family history for heart disease  Slide 3: Presentation and Evaluation The patient presented to the ER 2 hours after she experienced severe chest pain and shortness of breath following the sudden death of her husband. Symptoms included nausea and lightheadedness. EKG showed ST segment elevation in the anterior leads. Laboratory findings revealed mildly elevated troponin levels. An echocardiogram revealed left ventricular apical ballooning  with the base of the heart contracting normally or even more forcefully.   Slide 4: Diagnosis With no prior symptoms of heart disease and the presence of severe emotional trauma  in combination with EKG and echocardiogram results  the patient was given a working diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Slide 5: Treatment Patient was treated with aspirin  beta-blockers  and anticoagulants to prevent clots. Given the emotional trauma as an inciting factor  patient was also referred to a mental health professional to help deal with the grief and stress.  Slide 6: Outcome and Follow-up Our patient was discharged after 5 days with improved symptoms. Follow-up at ten weeks showed the restoration of normal left ventricular systolic function. Long-term prognosis for TTC is typically favorable  with most patients experiencing full recovery.  Slide 7: Conclusion Depicts the importance of considering Takotsubo in differential diagnosis during cardiac symptoms post major stress events. Need to manage not only the physical  but also the emotional well-being of patients is significant.

15,3,64,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial64,Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  I. Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  often referred to as 'broken heart syndrome'  is a condition characterized by acute and transient left ventricular dysfunction induced by severe emotional or physical stress.  II. Patient Demographics: - Patient's Initials: A.B. - Age: 58 years old - Gender: Female - Ethnicity: African American - Occupation: Office Worker  III. Presentation: A.B. presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain following the sudden death of her younger sister. She was taken into treatment where her heart was closely monitored.  IV. Medical History: A.B. has been generally healthy with no significant illnesses apart from hypertension  for which she takes amlodipine. She has a family history of heart disease  with her father having passed away due to a heart attack. She does not smoke  consume alcohol  or use drugs.   V. Symptoms and Examination: Given the circumstances  A.B. exhibited signs of acute stress and noted epigastric discomfort. On physical examination  it was observed that she was slightly hypotensive and had a prominent S4 on cardiac auscultation.   VI. Diagnostic Evaluation: Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in precordial leads and a mild elevation of cardiac troponin. Echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning with hypercontractile or normal basal segments  but ventriculography demonstrated a typical 'takotsubo' appearance of the left ventricle  and managed to exclude any chance of coronary artery disease.  VII. Current Management: A.B. was treated supportively for her symptoms and provided with standard heart failure treatment  including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. Her symptoms and cardiac function improved over the next few weeks.  VIII. Conclusion: The sudden emotional stress due to her sister's death led to a sympathetic surge  creating a multitude of cardiac abnormalities compatible with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This case serves as an effective reminder of the impact psychological stress can have on physical health.   IX. Key Learning Points: 1. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  although relatively rare  should be considered in differential diagnosis for patients presenting with chest pain and emotional stress. 2. Familiarization with unique pathophysiology and characteristic imaging findings can aid early identification and appropriate management of TTC. 3. Integrated patient care  involving physical and psychological support  is crucial to optimal patient outcomes. It is pivotal for healthcare practitioners to bear in mind the complex interaction between emotional health and cardiovascular disease.

15,3,81,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial81,Title: A Case Study of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Female Patient  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC)  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'  is a transient left ventricular dysfunction often linked to severe emotional or physical stress. Today  we're going to discuss the case of a 68-year-old woman suffering from this condition.  Slide 2: Demographics Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian woman. She recently lost her husband  which accounts for the severe emotional stress preceding her symptoms. She is a retired teacher and is a non-smoker and non-drinker.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Other than these  she has had no other significant medical conditions  surgical procedures  or hospitalizations. She has been adherent to her hypertensive and hyperlipidemic medications. She has no known allergies.  Slide 4: Clinical Presentation The patient came to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain accompanied by shortness of breath. The pain started suddenly earlier in the day and has persisted. She has rated the pain as 8/10 in severity. On assessment  her blood pressure was 158/90 mm Hg and pulse was 88 bpm.  Slide 5: Investigations  Initial EKG suggested ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)  but subsequent coronary angiography didn't show any significant abnormalities. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed left ventricular apical ballooning with left ventricular dysfunction  suggesting a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Troponin levels were also elevated.  Slide 6: Management and Outcome  The patient was managed conservatively considering she had TC. Her hypertensive medication was adjusted. Psychological counseling was initiated to help her cope with her recent bereavement. Over the following days  her symptoms improved  and a repeat echocardiogram showed a return of left ventricular function back to normal.  Slide 7: Discussion This case highlights the importance of recognizing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain  especially in post-menopausal women with recent severe stress. Despite its dramatic presentation  TC usually has a good prognosis with appropriate treatment and support. Future emphasis should be on the prevention of triggers  particularly stress.

15,3,84,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial84,Title: Case Presentation on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Patient Demographics The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  a resident of Florida. She is a retired school teacher  widowed  living with her unmarried daughter. She is a non-smoker and moderate alcohol consumer.   Slide 2: Past Medical History The patient has a past medical history marked by hypertension and type-2 diabetes mellitus  both under control using appropriate medications. There is no history of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction  but she has a family history of heart diseases. Her recent LDL and HDL cholesterol levels are slightly abnormal.  Slide 3: Presenting Complaint She presented to the emergency department following an episode of acute chest pain and shortness of breath after hearing about her brother's sudden death.  Slide 4: Clinical Examination  On examination  she was found to be in moderate distress. Her BP was 155/90 mmHg  heart rate was 100 beats/min  and her SpO2 was 94% on room air. Heart sounds were normal with no murmurs detected. A few bibasilar rales were noted.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Examination  ECG showed ST-segment elevation  with a subsequent troponin I level rising to 1.8 ng/dL. Emergency coronary angiography  however  did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. An echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning and contractile dysfunction.  Slide 6: Diagnosis Based on the clinical presentation  investigative and diagnostic findings  the patient was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as ‘broken heart syndrome’)  a stress-induced cardiomyopathy triggered by the sudden emotional stress of her brother's passing.  Slide 7: Treatment The patient was managed with supportive care  including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. The treatment emphasizes relieving the heart's workload and symptoms  preventing clot formation  and addressing triggers.  Slide 8: Follow-up and Prognosis The patient's condition improved significantly after treatment  and her symptoms resolved within a few weeks. A follow-up echocardiogram showed resolution of the apical ballooning. As with most cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  prognosis is generally good if properly managed  but psychological support and addressing stressors is crucial for secondary prevention.  Slide 9: Conclusion  This case highlights the strong interplay between emotional stress and cardiovascular health. Adequate emotional support and stress management strategies for patients are instrumental in preventing such events in susceptible individuals.
15,3,85,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial85,Title: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction  Our case is that of a 68-year-old postmenopausal woman  Mrs. A  presenting with Chest pain and shortness of breath.   Slide 2: Demographics  Mrs. A is a retired teacher  lives alone since her husband’s passing five years ago  and has two children who live out of state. She does not smoke  drink  nor use drugs. She has a background of hypertension and mild obesity  which she manages through diet control and medication.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mrs. A has had an uneventful past medical history other than well-controlled hypertension. She has no known allergies and no history of psychiatric illnesses. The patient has been on antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril) for the last ten years.  Slide 4: Current Health Incident  Mrs. A presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  shortness of breath  and nauseating feelings. The pain occurred suddenly while she was learning of her brother's unexpected death. There was no palpitation  syncope  or past similar episode.  Slide 5: Clinical Assessment & Diagnosis  She was tachycardic  and her blood pressure was 170/90mmHg. The Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads without pathological Q waves. Serum troponin T levels were slightly elevated. Coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis  but left ventriculography demonstrated left ventricular apical balooning compatible with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This was most likely triggered by severe emotional stress upon her brother's death.  Slide 6: Management & Follow-up  The patient was managed with Beta blockers  ACE inhibitors  and conservative measures of relieving stress. She recovered progressively over the next few weeks. At her 3-month follow-up appointment  ECG and echocardiogram returned to normal status. Her physical and emotional state was also markedly improved.  Slide 7: Conclusion  This case highlights that takotsubo cardiomyopathy  while less common  should be a considered differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with chest pain  especially when prompted by severe emotional stress or trauma.
15,3,86,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial86,Title: Case Presentation on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Slide 1: Introduction Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also termed as 'broken heart syndrome'  is a transient cardiac syndrome that mimics acute coronary syndrome. It is characterized by acute left ventricular failure and is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our subject is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  retired teacher  living in a suburban setting.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient has consistent medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia that have been managed with antihypertensive (ACE inhibitors) and statins. She also has a history of moderate depression for which she has been on SSRIs for the past 5 years.  Slide 4: Chief Complaint  The patient arrived in the ER complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that began abruptly after receiving news about the unexpected death of her close friend.   Slide 5: Clinical Observations  On examination  vital signs were consistent with moderate distress - elevated blood pressure at 168/96  heart rate 110 bpm  respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 94%. The ECG showed ST-elevation but no signs of obstructive coronary disease.  Slide 6: Initial Diagnosis and Management:  Aligning with her symptoms  ECG report and her recent exposure to severe emotional stress  she was given provisional diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She was managed with heart failure treatment protocols  including beta blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics.  Slide 7: Confirmation of Diagnosis  Follow-up echocardiogram displayed apical ballooning and contractile dysfunction characteristic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  confirming our initial diagnosis. Coronary angiography ruled out significant coronary artery disease.  Slide 8: Follow-Up and Prognosis  The patient was discharged on a regimen of ACE inhibitors  beta blockers  statins  and was advised cardiac rehabilitation. Patient counseling was also advised to deal with emotional stressors. Prognosis of the case is generally excellent  with nearly complete recovery expected over time  given appropriate management and no further intense stress episodes.  Slide 9: Conclusion This case emphasizes the role of emotional stress as a triggering factor for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and illustrates the importance of recognizing this condition as a differential diagnosis in acute chest pain settings.

Slide 2: Patient Demographics - Patient X is a 55-year-old  Caucasian female. She is a non-smoker and leads a moderately active lifestyle. She lives alone  recently widowed  which what may have induced her stress levels.  Slide 3: Past Medical History - Her past medical history is relatively uneventful  with well-managed hypothyroidism and no documented history of cardiovascular diseases or mental health issues.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms  - Patient X presented with acute chest pain. She first experienced this pain while attending her husband's funeral  it was intense  lasting more than 15 minutes  didn't subside with rest and radiated to her left shoulder.    Slide 5: Diagnosis  - The initial suspicion was acute coronary syndrome due to the nature of her symptoms but an electrocardiogram and serial biomarker studies suggested atypical findings. Following a coronary angiography  the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Slide 6: Clinical Characteristics - In Patient X's case  the emotional stress from her recent loss was the likely trigger for her condition. Her condition was characterized by transient left ventricular apical ballooning  absence of significant obstructive coronary disease or plaque rupture.  Slide 7: Management  - The patient was managed with support measures including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and follow-up psychotherapy for her recent loss. The prognosis was good with full recovery of heart function expected in weeks.

15,3,100,diagnosis15-prompt3-trial100,Slide 1: Introduction ------------------------- Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy where there's a sudden temporary weakening of the muscular portion of the heart.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics ----------------------------------- Our patient  Mrs. X  is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  a retired school teacher who enjoys gardening and reading. She is a widow and lives independently. She has a healthy BMI and has never smoked or consumed alcohol excessively.  Slide 3: Past Medical History ----------------------------------- Previously  Mrs. X has been diagnosed with hypertension  well-controlled with medication. She hasn't had any serious ailments or surgeries in the past. However  recent significant life stressors  including the loss of her husband six months ago  have had a major impact on her overall wellbeing.  Slide 4: Presentation to Medical Facility ----------------------------------------------- She presents to the emergency room with acute chest pain similar to a heart attack. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath and sudden onset fatigue. Mrs. X states that the severity of discomfort increased progressively throughout the day.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Evaluation ---------------------------------- ECG indicates ST-elevation in the anterior leads  initial suspicion may point towards an acute myocardial infarction. However  cardiac biomarkers while elevated  are not consistent with typical heart attack levels. Echocardiography reveals the classic finding for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with apical ballooning and hyperkinesia at the basal walls  leading to the diagnosis.   Slide 6: Management and Prognosis -------------------------------------- Mrs. X is admitted for monitoring and supportive treatment primarily focusing on the alleviation of heart failure symptoms with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. As the condition is typically reversible  prognosis is generally favorable. However  it is vital that she seeks help to manage her stress and consider getting counseling to cope with her psychiatric and emotional health.   Slide 7: Conclusion ------------------------ To conclude  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a crucial differential in the evaluation of acute chest pain  particularly in post-menopausal women with recent intense emotional or physiological stress.   Slide 8: Q&A -------------- Open floor for any questions and discussion.

15,5,43,diagnosis15-prompt5-trial43,A 67-year-old  Japanese female with a history of depression and recent episode of severe emotional stress presents with acute onset chest pain and dyspnea. These symptoms are consistent with acute coronary syndrome  though EKG readings display slight abnormalities in ST-segment evolution inconsistent with her symptomology. Echocardiogram reveals a left ventricular apical ballooning effect  with a significant reduction in ejection fraction but without any coinciding significant coronary artery disease – suggestive of a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
15,5,44,diagnosis15-prompt5-trial44,Demographics: 62-year-old Asian female  Medical History: Non-smoker  mild hypertension controlled with medication  recent death of her husband two weeks ago  no known family history of heart disease  no history of drug abuse or high alcohol consumption.  Presentation: The patient presents with severe chest pain and shortness of breath  which began suddenly while she was attending her husband's funeral. She describes the pain as pressure-like  radiating to her left arm and jaw  similar to descriptions of a heart attack. Accompanying symptoms include mild nausea and cold sweats. There are no evident signs of fever  cough  or other infection symptoms.  Upon taking an EKG  results are suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. However  a subsequent angiogram does not demonstrate significant blockage in her coronary arteries. Echocardiogram  however  is suggestive of left ventricular apical ballooning. Cardiac biomarkers show a mildly elevated troponin level. The sudden emotional stress of her husband's death combined with current symptoms and negative coronary angiogram findings lead to a suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or broken-heart syndrome.
15,5,45,diagnosis15-prompt5-trial45,A 64-year-old Caucasian woman presents with sudden  severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She has a past medical history of hypertension and recently experienced the sudden death of her husband.

15,5,83,diagnosis15-prompt5-trial83,A 65-year-old female patient  retired school teacher  with a history of hypertension controlled by medication presents to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain and difficulty breathing. She reports that these symptoms started following the sudden death of her husband. She denies any history of coronary artery disease  heart failure  or diabetes. On physical examination  her blood pressure is elevated (150/95 mmHg)  and she has a rapid heart rate. An EKG reveals ST-segment elevation and T-wave abnormalities. A subsequent echocardiogram shows apical ballooning of the left ventricle with constricted base  a peculiar change in the shape of her heart that is not typical of a heart attack — a shape commonly associated with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Lab results reveal a modest increase in troponin level suggestive of myocardial injury. She denies any alcohol  tobacco  or illicit drug use  but reports she has been under extreme emotional stress since her husband passed away recently.

However  she denies experiencing any precipitating factors like heavy physical work or emotional distress. On examination  she appears anxious  pallor with diaphoresis. Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation with slight T-wave inversion  a pattern not typical for any particular coronary artery territory. A subsequent coronary angiography result excluded significant coronary atherosclerosis. With these features and noticeable apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of basal segments on left ventriculography  a provisional diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made.
15,5,93,diagnosis15-prompt5-trial93,A 68-year-old Caucasian female with a significant medical history involving anxiety and hypertension presents with severe retrosternal chest pain and shortness of breath. The onset of symptoms occurred abruptly after she received news of her son's sudden demise. On examination  elevated blood pressure (165/90 mmHg)  tachycardia with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute and labored respirations were noted. Pain was described as pressure-like  radiating to her left arm  lasting for approximately 2 hours  and rated as an '8' on a 1-10 scale. Besides  her symptoms also included dizziness and nausea  but no symptoms relevant for a fever  cough or nasopharyngeal symptoms to suggest an upper respiratory tract infection. The timing and nature of the chest pain in conjunction with the emotional stressor raised suspicion for takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

More diagnostic tests including echocardiogram and cardiac angiography would be needed to confirm the diagnosis."
15,6,13,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial13,Patient Profile:  Name: Jane Doe Age: 65  Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Occupational Status: Retired teacher Marital Status: Widow  Presentation: Patient presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started approximately 2 hours ago. She describes the pain as pressure-like  central  and radiating to her left arm. She reports that she felt very frightened and high emotional stress when the episode started.  Past Medical History:  - She has a history of hypertension for which she has been taking medication for the past 10 years. - Two years ago  she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has been managing it with diet and medication. - She had a complete hysterectomy at the age of 50 due to uterine fibroids. - No known history of coronary artery disease  heart failure  or arrhythmias. - She has a known history of anxiety and depression for which she is in counseling. - She has a history of smoking 1 pack/day for 20 years  but quit smoking 15 years ago.  Family History:  - Her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. - Her mother had diabetes and hypertension and died at the age of 75 from a stroke. - Her elder sister has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease.  Social History:  Lives alone after her husband passed away 3 months ago. Children live out of state. She has been under significant emotional stress since her spouse's demise. She doesn't use illicit drugs. She does not consume alcohol. She has a sedentary lifestyle.  Associated Symptoms:   She also reports feeling intense fear and a sense of impending doom before the onset of the chest pain. She feels vague dizziness  but denies any syncope  nausea  vomiting  or sweating. She denies any palpitations  cough  or fever.  Possible Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Triggers:  Experiencing a major emotional event - the death of her spouse and living alone could have precipitated what is known as the “broken heart syndrome”.  Concluding Note: This patient demographic - postmenopausal women with a recent stressful event - is typically seen in patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This clinical picture is suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy but it is vital to distinguish it from an acute myocardial infarction  another condition that can present with similar symptoms but requires different management.
15,6,14,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial14,"Patient Description: The patient is a 70 year old Caucasian female  recently widowed  with a history of controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. There is no known history of coronary heart disease  stroke or diabetes. She has been experiencing consistent episodes of severe anxiety and stress following the unexpected death of her husband.  Presenting Complaint: The patient is presenting with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. In addition  she is experiencing sudden weakness and persistent fatigue. Episodes of light-headedness and fainting spells have been reported.  Inquiries and Relevant Investigations: An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows changes similar to those seen during a heart attack. Serum cardiac biomarkers (troponin) is elevated suggesting myocardial injury while chest radiography reveals an absence of acute heart failure or other causes of chest pain. An echocardiogram or a ventriculogram reveals a ballooning left ventricle with apical involvement  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The coronary angiogram confirms the absence of obstructive coronary disease or acute plaque rupture which helps to rule out myocardial infarction.  Past Medical History (PMH): The patient has a history of controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which she has been taking regular medication (Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for hypertension and statins for hyperlipidemia).  Social History (SH): The patient is a retired teacher who lives alone. She quit smoking 20 years back and occasionally drinks alcohol. She does not use any recreational drugs. She follows a balanced diet and her physical activities are moderate. She recently lost her husband and has been struggling with severe psychological stress.  Family History (FH): Her father died of a heart attack at the age of 75 and her mother died of complications related to Alzheimer's disease at the age of 82.  In Summary: 70 year old Caucasian female presents with symptoms consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  otherwise known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""". Her present cardiomyopathy could be attributed to her recent severe emotional stress due to the loss of her husband. The absence of acute coronary syndrome makes takotsubo cardiomyopathy a likely diagnosis."

15,6,16,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial16,Patient Profile:  - Age: 66 years old - Sex: Female - Race/Ethnicity: Asian - Occupation: Retired - Smoker: Non-smoker - Alcohol: Rarely - Exercise: Light physical activities twice a week - Diet: Balanced diet with low salt.  Presenting Symptoms:  - Chest pain - Shortness of breath - Fatigue - Palpitations  Relevant Past Medical History:  - Experienced a major stressful event in life recently  - Diagnosed with Hypertension for 15 years - History of Panic Disorder - Family history of Heart Diseases - Postmenopausal woman  Primary diagnosis:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome.  Primary Diagnosis Rationale:  Given the patient’s recent exposure to severe emotional stress combined with her symptoms of chest pain  shortness of breath and fatigue  a possible diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is likely. Her risk is increased due to her age  female sex  postmenopausal status  history of hypertension and panic disorder.  Relevant Tests:  - EKG  which might show ST-segment elevation  T wave inversion or QT-interval prolongation - Lab tests  including cardiac enzymes which can be slightly elevated - Echocardiogram  which can reveal left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning - Coronary angiograms to exclude the presence of any obstructive coronary artery disease.   Secondary Diagnosis:  Due to the patient's history of hypertension  consideration must also be given to the fact that her symptoms might be a result of a myocardial infarction secondary to her longstanding high blood pressure.   Management Plan:  - Hospitalization for monitoring of cardiac function - Heart medications such as Beta blockers  ACE inhibitors  etc. to manage symptoms and reduce heart's workload - Psychiatric consultation for addressing panic disorder and ensuring appropriate strategies for stress management - Patient education about the nature of her condition  its links with stress  and healthy lifestyle habits. - Long-term management of her hypertension and regular follow-ups.
15,6,17,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial17,Demographic Information: Patient is a 65-year-old female  Caucasian  married with two adult children. She is a retired high school teacher  living with her husband in suburban Milwaukee.  Presenting Concerns: The patient reports experiencing severe  crushing chest pain and significant breathlessness which led her to seek medical attention. She confirmed the pain and shortness of breath started suddenly  without any obvious trigger.  Past Medical History: She has a history of hypertension  for which she takes a low-dose diuretic. She has never smoked  drinks alcohol moderately  and has a healthy diet. Her family history includes heart disease  with her father dying from a heart attack at age 70 and her mother living with heart failure. The patient has no history of emotional or physical trauma  however  she is currently under stress dealing with the recent death of a close friend.  Past Surgical History: There are no previous surgeries.  Psychosocial History: The patient lives with her husband  and she reports a supportive relationship. Their children live nearby and they meet often. She is known to get anxious often  especially when dealing with stressful situations. She has been seeing a psychologist to cope with recent grief.  Review of Systems: She has no history of syncope or fatigue. There's no cough  hemoptysis or wheezing. She denies experiencing any palpitations  orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. There's no past history of fever  weight loss  rash or arthritis.  Medications: The patient's current medications include hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily for hypertension. She's not known to be allergic to any drugs.  Recent Laboratory Results: The patient's EKG shows abnormal Q waves  with ST elevations in leads II  III  and aVF  and her cardiac troponin levels are elevated  indicating possible myocardial injury. Her chest X-ray is yet to be reported.   Possible Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms  the sudden onset and the EKG changes  the most likely diagnosis is Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Further investigation is warranted for concrete diagnosis and formulation of a treatment plan.
15,6,18,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial18,Problem Representation:  Demographic Characterization: Patient A is a 60-year-old Caucasian female  a widow who recently lost her husband a few months ago. She is a retired high school teacher  living alone. She does not smoke or drink alcohol  and has no family history of heart disease.  Relevant Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of chronic generalized anxiety disorder and major depression for which she takes escitalopram. She also has a diagnosis of hypertension and hyperlipidemia controlled with a calcium channel blocker and a statin  respectively. She also has mild osteoarthritis managed with occasional pain medication.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the emergency room with acute chest pain  described as a severe crushing sensation in her chest  radiating to her left arm. She also endorsed feelings of extreme anxiety and shortness of breath. Increase in heart rate  increase in blood pressure and feeling of nausea was also observed. An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI)  which is a typical feature in takotsubo cardiomyopathy. However  on further investigations (e.g.  coronary angiography  performing an echocardiogram)  the patient was found to have normal coronary arteries  but with apical ballooning of the left ventricle ─ a classic feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   The patient's recent bereavement  coupled with her chronic anxiety disorder and sudden onset of stress cardiomyopathy symptoms  all point towards a likely diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
15,6,19,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial19,Patient Profile:  Name: Ms. Anne Marie T. Gender: Female Age: 65 Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired School Teacher Location: San Diego  CA  US  Presenting Problem: Ms. Anne Marie T. presents to the emergency department complaining of chest pain that started 2 hours ago. The pain is sharp and radiates to her left shoulder. Associated symptoms include shortness of breath  nausea and light-headedness.   Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension (controlled with Lisinopril 10mg daily) 2. Type 2 Diabetes (controlled with Metformin 1000 mg twice daily) 3. Hyperlipidemia (controlled with Atorvastatin 20mg daily) 4. History of occasional panic attacks  Medication Allergies: No known drug allergies  Social History: She is a widow and lives alone. She does not smoke and drank alcohol socially before retiring. She indicates her stress levels have been unusually high due to recent passing of her husband.  Family History: Both parents had a history of coronary artery disease and her mother had a stroke in her 70s.  Symptoms: She describes a sudden onset of severe chest pain  similar to a heart attack  but occurring after episodes of severe emotional stress. The pain is characterized as sharp  8 out of 10 in severity  and radiates to her left arm. She also reports difficulty in breathing especially on exertion  fatigue and feeling light-headed.  Vitals Recorded: Blood pressure: 145/90 mm Hg Heart rate: 110 beats per minute Temperature: 37.0°C (98.6 F) Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute  Preliminary Diagnosis: The patient's symptoms suggest she may be experiencing an acute episode of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  which could be related to severe psychological stress due to a recent bereavement. This condition  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  often mimics symptoms of a heart attack  and is characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium (muscle of the heart).  Further anticipated investigations: - ECG (Electrocardiogram): to rule out myocardial infarction and indicate signs of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy - Blood tests: to check for elevated cardiac enzymes  indicating heart injury - Echocardiogram or cardiac MRI: to confirm diagnosis by visualizing the typical apical ballooning of the left ventricle and exclude other conditions causing similar symptoms  Treatment: This will depend on the severity of her symptoms and diagnostic results but may include medications to manage blood pressure  heart rate  and to relieve symptoms of congestive heart failure. Anti-anxiety medication or referral to psychological therapy may also be considered given the significant role of stress in this condition.    High-Risk Factors: Advanced age  female gender  post-menopausal  history of hypertension  type 2 Diabetes and Hyperlipidemia  increased recent psychosocial stress  and family history of cardiovascular disease.
15,6,20,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial20,"Problem Representation:  A 58-year-old Caucasian female presents to the hospital with acute onset severe chest pain radiating to the left arm. She reports that the pain started suddenly about an hour ago and it has been persistent since then. Associated symptoms include shortness of breath  nausea  and feeling lightheaded.  Her past medical history is relevant for hypertension  which she has been managing with lisinopril for the past five years. She has been fairly compliant with her medication and follows up regularly with her primary care physician. She is a nonsmoker  consumes alcohol occasionally  and leads a mostly sedentary lifestyle. Regarding her family history  her father passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 60  and her mother has Type 2 diabetes.  The patient reports that the chest pain started while she was hosting a family gathering at her home  during which she was under significant emotional stress as she was settling a family dispute.  Based on her presentation  there's a high suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""")  an acute stress-induced type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy that results in acute transient left ventricular dysfunction often mimicking symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome."

She had experienced a highly stressful event the previous day - a car accident in which she was a passenger. She has been widowed for one year  and although she generally copes well with her grief  she also reported feelings of severe emotional stress over the last few days.  Medical History:  1) Hypertension - diagnosed 10 years ago  under control with medication. 2) Osteoporosis - diagnosed 5 years ago  manages with diet and exercise. 3) Episodic Migraines - since her late 20s  managed with lifestyle changes and medication as necessary. 4) Underwent menopause at the age of 52.   Clinical Findings:  She shows the characteristic symptoms of chest pain  dyspnea  fainting and has a history of recent excessive stress. ECG reveals ST-segment elevation in precordial leads  mimicking an acute myocardial infarction. Echocardiography shows hyperkinesia of the basal segments and dyskinesia of the mid-segments and apical segments of the left ventricle  suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Final Diagnosis:  Based on her presentation  clinical examination  and investigative findings  the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome). The patient's recent intense emotional stress is likely to have triggered the condition.

The symptoms were closely similar to those of a heart attack.  Medical History:   The patient has a history of hypertension  which she has been managing with medication for the past five years. She has been a non-smoker since birth and reports a mild habit of drinking only on social occasions.   The patient also recently experienced a significant emotional trauma  the loss of her spouse  3 weeks ago. She has been undergoing therapy but seems to have suffered severe emotional stress due to the incident.   Family History:  Her father died from a heart attack  but there is no other significant cardiovascular history in her family.  Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  the patient's blood pressure was elevated (150/90 mmHg). Electrocardiogram (ECG) during the chest pain showed ST-segment elevation. The cardiac enzymes tests showed moderate elevation (troponin I  2.0 ng/mL; normal  < 0.04 ng/mL).   Preliminary diagnosis:  Based on these factors  a preliminary diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome) was considered – a condition often triggered by severe emotional distress and presents very similar to a heart attack. The patient would need to undergo further diagnostic tests such as an echocardiogram or cardiac MRI to confirm the diagnosis.
15,6,24,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial24,Problem Representation:  Name: Mrs. Margaret Wilson  Age: 65 years  Gender: Female  Race: Caucasian   Address: 123 West Elm Street  Beverly Hills  CA  90210  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Wilson  a 65-year-old woman is reporting acute onset of chest pain accompanied by shortness of breath following severe emotional distress. The event occurred subsequent to the sudden passing of her husband the previous night.  Demographic context: Mrs. Wilson is a recently widowed woman living alone in a single dwelling home. She is retired and has two daughters living out of state. She has a liberal arts education and worked as a school teacher. Her hobbies include gardening and reading.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension  diagnosed 10 years ago  and she has been taking amlodipine 10 mg daily.     2. Mild dyslipidemia for which she takes atorvastatin 20 mg at bedtime.     3. Asthma since childhood  controlled with occasional use of salbutamol inhaler.     4. She underwent menopause at age 52  with no Hormone Replacement Therapy.     5. History of regular mammography and PAP smears – all with benign results.    6. She is a non-smoker and consumes moderate amounts of alcohol.  Family History: Her father died of a heart attack at age 67. Her mother lived until age 90 and had Alzheimer’s disease. She has a brother with type 2 diabetes and a sister with hypertension.  Social History: Lives alone; daughters visit occasionally. She has a good social network of friends with whom she stays active. Her husband passed away recently due to a sudden heart attack.   Pharmaceutical History: Consistent with amlodipine and atorvastatin. Occasionally uses an over-the-counter multivitamin. No known drug allergies.   Review of Systems: No recent fever  weight loss  change in bowel or urinary habits. Slight increase in frequency of asthma attacks over the past few months.  This problem representation allows for a more comprehensive and holistic view of Mrs. Wilson's health status. Her presentation and background raise potential flags for features of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  including sudden emotional stress  acute chest pain  and breathlessness  in addition to her age  gender  and hypertension  which might contribute to her risk. The next steps involve further examination  diagnostic tests like EKG  echocardiogram  and potentially coronary angiography to confirm the diagnosis.

The pain started a few hours after receiving news of the sudden death of her son and she admits to feeling fear and intense emotional stress. She reports no history of similar prior episodes and has no family history of heart disease. She is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  she is in visible distress and has a blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg and a heart rate of 110 bpm. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. EKG shows changes suggesting myocardial ischemia. Lab findings include normal complete blood count  elevated cardiac troponin and NT-proBNP.  Clinical Differential Diagnosis: Her presentation is consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". Other differential diagnoses to consider include acute myocardial infarction  acute coronary syndrome  and aortic dissection.  Relevant Past Medical History includes:  1) Controlled hypertension: Although she is at risk for heart disease due to her age and hypertension  she has no history of angina  suggesting that her heart disease is not due to long-standing atherosclerosis. 2) Asthma: As a respiratory condition  this could potentially exacerbate a heart condition  but it seems unlikely to be directly relevant to her current presentation. 3) Recent loss and extreme emotional stress: This is a major indicative factor for takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   In conclusion  takotsubo cardiomyopathy appears to be the most likely diagnosis given the precipitating factors  clinical presentation and initial investigation."

Her history of hypertension may also contribute to her risk. The sudden onset of her symptoms following a severe emotional event strongly suggests takotsubo cardiomyopathy  although further diagnostic tests will be necessary to confirm this.
15,6,31,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial31,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Angela Middleton    Gender: Female    Age: 65   Ethnicity: Caucasian   Occupation: Retired (former high school teacher) Residential Status: Lives alone  Current Problem:  Mrs. Middleton is presenting with symptoms indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She has been experiencing symptoms such as breathlessness  chest pain  and fatigue for the past couple of days. Mrs. Middleton was brought to the emergency department after fainting at home recently.   Relevant Past Medical History:  1. Hypertensive for the past 10 years  under medication 2. Diagnosed with situational stress and anxiety disorder two years ago 3. The patient had a hysterectomy 15 years ago.  4. Non-smoker but drinks wine occasionally. 5. No known drug allergies. 6. Normal cholesterol levels but obese with BMI of 31 7. The patient follows a regular exercise regimen but has been neglecting it for the past six months due to depression after the death of her husband.  Family History:  Her mother passed away due to a heart attack. Dad has a history of type 2 diabetes.  Recent Events:  Mrs. Middleton was recently widowed  after her husband suffered from a fatal stroke six months ago.  Social History:  Lives alone  has three children who are all based in different cities. She has a limited social circle and has increased social isolation post her husband's death.  Conclusion: The above-mentioned demographic characterization and past medical history of Mrs. Middleton seem to have contributed towards the current presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The physical stress caused by her obesity and hypertension combined with the emotional stress of her husband's passing seem to have triggered the chest pain and other symptoms related to takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The next steps would include a detailed physical examination  further diagnostic testing  and planning a course of action for management of her presenting symptoms. A psychological referral may be beneficial for her recent widowhood and resulting depression.
15,6,32,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial32,Problem Representation:   Patient Demographics: A 65-year-old female with Japanese descent presents to the office.  Chief Complaint: The patient mentions experiencing sudden intense chest pain  palpitations  and shortness of breath  similar to that of a heart attack  although she has no history of coronary artery disease.  Pre-existing Conditions: She has a history of hypertension  triggered by emotional stress  which adds to the stress cardiomyopathy. She also has type 2 diabetes  controlled with medication. She also mentions experiencing sleep disorders and regular panic attacks.  Lifestyle and Psychosocial History: She is a widow for the last five years and finds it difficult to manage stress following her husband's death. She follows a balanced diet and doesn't smoke or drink alcohol. There is a history of episodic anxiety and recurrent depression.  Family History: Her family history includes a mother who had a stress-induced cardiomyopathy  which suggests a genetic predisposition to the condition.  Medications: She takes Metformin for her diabetes and Lisinopril for her hypertension. She also takes Fluoxetine for her depression.  Investigations:  Upon conducting an electrocardiogram (ECG)  it reveals ST-segment elevation. Later  a coronarography shows no signs of coronary artery disease that would otherwise explain the clinical symptoms. A subsequent echocardiogram indicates apical ballooning consistent with the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Problem Summary: This typical case of a patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is characterized by acute onset of chest pain and dyspnea  with a background of emotional stress. The patient has risk factors including age  gender  postmenopausal status  genetic predisposition  hypertension  and diabetes  which may contribute to the development of the condition. Her mental health issues likely play a significant role. There is no evidence of coronary artery occlusion  and evaluations are consistent with the clinical diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.

She also reports feeling lightheaded and is apparently excessively worried.   Vital Signs:  Blood pressure: 145/95 mmHg  Heart rate: 103 beats per minute  Temperature: 36.7 C  Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute  Oxygen saturation: 93% on room air   Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension - diagnosed 10 years ago and managed with amlodipine 5 mg daily.  2. Type 2 Diabetes - diagnosed 5 years ago and managed with metformin 1000 mg twice daily. 3. History of depression and anxiety - she has been under regular follow-up from a psychiatrist and takes daily fluoxetine and clonazepam on an as-needed basis.   Family History:  Mother died of myocardial infarction at age 70. Father died of stroke at age 72.   Social History: Widowed with two adult children. She recently lost her brother to lung cancer  which has significantly increased her stress levels and anxiety. She does not smoke or consume alcohol.   Based on the current clinical presentation  medical history  and emotional stress  takotsubo cardiomyopathy is suspected. The patient's high blood pressure  tachycardia  and diabetes further increase her risk for heart disease.   Note:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken-heart syndrome""""  is characterized by sudden acute stress leading to severe heart muscle weakening. This condition often presents like a heart attack and is typically triggered by severe emotional or physical stress. Prompt diagnosis is crucial for appropriate management to prevent serious complications."

Age: 69 years Gender: Female Ethnicity: Asian Occupation: Retired School Teacher Smoker: No Alcohol: Occasionally  Diet: Primarily plant-based Physical activity: 15-30 minutes of walking daily Genetic History: No significant family history of heart disease  PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Ms J.W. presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain and palpitations. The pain is described as sharp and radiating down the left arm. It began abruptly after receiving the news of her daughter’s sudden death earlier this day. She has also been feeling lightheaded and has had episodes of shortness of breath for the last couple of hours.  RELEVANT PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Ms. J.W. was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder 5 years ago  for which she has been receiving regular mental health therapy and is taking a daily selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Her cardiovascular risk factors include hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago  currently under control with medication.  RECENT LAB TESTS AND CLINICAL FINDINGS:  An electrocardiogram (ECG) conducted during her hospital admission demonstrates ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads  highly suggestive of an acute coronary event. Her recent blood test also reveals modestly increased cardiac troponin levels.  This clinical scenario is suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or 'broken heart syndrome'  given the acute emotional stress that Ms J.W. has recently encountered and the characteristic ECG and blood test findings. A definitive diagnosis would require further investigations such as echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  This problem representation provides an overview of a typical patient presenting with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Factors such as stress  age  and female gender are common risk factors associated with this condition. Past medical history of mental health conditions  such as anxiety disorder  and cardiovascular disease (hypertension) are also in keeping with typical demographic and medical histories found in takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients.

Past Medical History: - Controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for ten years. - Hypertension for fifteen years  presently under control  on medication. - High cholesterol levels  on statin therapy.  - Recently treated for anxiety and depression following the death of her spouse.  - She had a minor ischemic stroke three years ago  from which she fully recovered.   Social History: - Non-smoker - Moderate alcohol consumption - Not physically active  Current Medication: - Metformin 500mg for diabetes - Atorvastatin 10mg for hyperlipidemia - Lisinopril 10mg for hypertension - Sertraline 50mg for depression and anxiety  Family History: - Father died from myocardial infarction at 72. - Mother had hypertension  died at 90 from natural causes.   This patient’s profile indicates a relatively high risk for cardiovascular disease due to her age  diabetes  hypertension  and high cholesterol levels. These factors  combined with recent severe emotional stress  increase her susceptibility to takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
15,6,41,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial41,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 66-year-old Caucasian female.  Chief Complaint: The patient comes in presenting with chest pain that she describes as severe and sharp. The pain began suddenly earlier today. It is associated with shortness of breath  mild nausea  and dizziness but no known triggers or relieving factors.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  which has been controlled with lisinopril for the last 10 years. She has also been undergoing treatment for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. She's a non-smoker  moderate alcohol consumer  and denies any illegal drug use. The patient has no history of cardiac disease  but her mother had a myocardial infarction at the age of 59.  Recent Past Events: It is noteworthy that the patient recently experienced severe emotional stress after the death of her husband 2 weeks ago.  Current Medications: Lisinopril 20mg once daily and levothyroxine 75 mcg once daily.  Social History: The patient is a retired schoolteacher living with her son. She exercises daily and maintains a balanced diet.   This patient's acute onset chest pain  precipitated by a recent emotional stressor  in combination with her demographic and absence of coronary artery disease risk factors are suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome""""  a condition often caused by severe emotional stress that results in weakening of the left ventricle  the heart's main pumping chamber.   Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy can mimic symptoms of a heart attack  such as chest pain and shortness of breath  tests (e.g.  an angiogram  cardiac MRI  ECG  blood tests) will likely show no signs of coronary artery blockage commonly associated with a heart attack  leading to a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Prescription medicines  like ACE inhibitors  beta blockers  and diuretics  would potentially be used to manage the condition following the diagnosis."

She described the pain as """"crushing"""" and felt like a heavy pressure  radiating to her left arm and jaw. This episode was accompanied by shortness of breath  nausea  vomiting  and symptoms of anxiety like sweats and palpitations which lasted till the pain subsided. She reports experiencing similar but less severe episodes in the past few weeks  which were exacerbated by high-stress situations at work.  Previous medical history: Ms. Abigail has a known history of hypertension and anxiety disorder. She also had an episode of major depressive disorder 5 years ago  which was managed with psychotherapy and medication. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She is not diabetic and has no known history of heart disease. Her family history is remarkable for heart disease (father had an MI at 60 years old).  Current medications: She is currently taking an antihypertensive (Lisinopril 10 mg daily) and an anxiolytic (Escitalopram 10 mg daily) on a regular basis. No known drug allergies.  Diagnostic impressions: Based on her symptoms  history  and risk factors  she was suspected with acute coronary syndrome initially but an EKG revealing ST-segment elevation but normal troponin and angiogram levels led to the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome).  The combination of her chest pain  EKG changes  and the onset during a time of increased stress  coupled with the absence of significant coronary artery disease support the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."

Has a history of hypertension under management with medication.     2. He is a non-smoker but consumed alcohol socially until eight years ago.     3. Lost his wife to cancer two years ago.     4. Suffers from generalized anxiety disorder and occasional panic attack for which he is under medication.     5. No history of heart diseases in the immediate family.     6. Generally manages to maintain a balanced diet and moderate physical activity.  Present Complaints:  - John Doe presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute chest pain radiating to his left shoulder that started suddenly while he was watching a football match at home. - The pain was described as 'squeezing' in nature and also complained of feeling light-headed  nauseous  and profuse sweating.  Test Results:   - Initial EKG revealed ST-segment elevation suggestive of a myocardial infarction.   - Blood tests showed slightly elevated cardiac enzyme levels.  - A subsequent angiogram revealed the absence of critical coronary blockages.  - An echocardiogram showed left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning.  Problem Statement:  Based on the presenting symptoms  test findings  and the patient's past medical history — particularly the recent episode of intense emotional stress — a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also termed 'broken heart syndrome') is suspected. The patient's age and history of hypertension could have further predisposed him to this covdition.   The critical challenge now is to manage the patient's acute symptoms and stabilize his cardiovascular function  while also considering long-term strategies to manage his psychological stress and any underlying disorders (e.g.  his panic disorder)  given their likely role in triggering this condition.
15,6,46,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial46,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Lorraine Bell Age: 68 years old Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher Marital Status: Widowed Residence: New York City  Upper West Side Insurance: Medicare  Chief Complaint: Severe chest pain and difficulty breathing that started a few hours following the news of her sister's sudden death.  Relevant Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension under control with medication (5 years) 2. High cholesterol under control with diet and lifestyle changes (3 years) 3. No history of cardiovascular diseases. 4. No history of diabetes. 5. No history of respiratory diseases. 6. Non-smoker and moderate drinker. 7. History of anxiety disorder (10 years)  currently managed with cognitive-behavioral therapy. 8. Underwent menopause at age 50  no history of hormone replacement therapy.  Potential Indications: The symptoms  alongside the patient's demographic and background  strongly suggest Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as 'broken heart syndrome'). This condition often mimics the symptoms of a heart attack and is commonly precipitated by severe emotional distress. The patient's recent tragic loss  coupled with her age  sex and history of anxiety disorder  aligns with the typical demographic for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  which is a postmenopausal woman experiencing significant emotional stress.  Next Steps: Immediate cardiovascular examination to rule out acute myocardial infarction. Echocardiogram and coronary angiography to confirm Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. If diagnosis confirmed  acute management should include monitoring  supportive care  and possible temporary use of heart failure medications as needed. Long-term  the patient may benefit from evaluation by a mental health professional for therapeutic interventions  dealing with acute psychological stress  and managing her anxiety disorder to prevent future episodes.

Patient Modifiers (Predisposing Factors):  - Recent stressful event: High levels of emotional stress at work due to high employee turnover rate. - Diabetes: No  - Hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol or triglyceride levels): No - Obesity: No  BMI is within normal range - Family history: None for heart disorders  but maternal history of anxiety disorder.  Summary of Past Medical History:  Ms. Anderson  a 58-year-old Caucasian female  presents with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Historical issues of hypertension treated with Lisinopril  and anxiety and depression treated with fluoxetine may have contributed to her current cardiac condition. No past history or risk factors indicating hyperlipidemia  obesity  or diabetes. Recent high stress levels additionally make her susceptible to takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Family history includes a maternal history of anxiety disorder. Despite this  she maintains an active lifestyle  is a non-smoker  and socially consumes alcohol.   Note: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". It is a cardiomyopathy associated most commonly with acute emotional or physical stress  causing severe heart muscle failure. Most often  the condition affects post-menopausal women.

Presenting Complaints: The patient presents with chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient describes the pain as heavy and crushing  located in the center of her chest. The symptoms started suddenly after she received news about the sudden death of her brother.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  the patient appears anxious. She has an elevated heart rate and blood pressure. The cardiovascular exam shows no murmurs  rubs or gallops. The lungs are clear to auscultation.   Diagnostic Impression: Considering the acute onset of severe chest pain and emotional stress with no risk factors for coronary artery disease  the clinical impression is towards Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as Broken Heart Syndrome).  Further diagnostic workup like electrocardiography  cardiac markers (like troponin) and an echocardiogram will be required to confirm the diagnosis.  Management: Pending diagnostic confirmation  the initial approach might include supportive care and symptom control  monitoring of cardiac function  and potential utilization of medications like beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Psychotherapy or psychiatric consultation may be useful given the patient's reported stressors and psychiatric history.

Immunization Status: She is up to date on her immunizations  including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.   In a patient like Ms. Williams with high stress level  severe chest pain and history of hypertension  the concern for takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken-heart syndrome) can be high  especially considering the sudden onset of her chest pain and absence of coronary artery disease.
15,6,58,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial58,Patient Profile:  Patient is a 67-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian female.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presents acute chest pain and shortness of breath  symptoms align with acute coronary syndrome. However  her heart's left ventricle has a balloon appearance  typical of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Past Medical History:  - She has a significant history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are currently managed with medications (Lisinopril 10mg daily  Atorvastatin 40mg daily). - She was found to have osteoporosis on DEXA scan 3 years prior and takes Alendronate 70mg weekly. - Patient has no history of diabetes  heart disease  or smoking.  Psychosocial History:  She is a retired school teacher  lives alone  and her husband passed away 6 months ago. She has been under significant emotional distress since then. She has two adult children who live out-of-state.  Review of Systems:  Aside from her chest pain and shortness of breath  she reports occasional dizziness but denies any orthopnea  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  or peripheral edema.  Physical Examination:  The patient is afebrile  with a blood pressure of 162/92 mmHg  heart rate 105 bpm  and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. She appears anxious. Heart sounds are regular with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Lung fields are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her extremities are without peripheral edema.   Clinical Impression:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome)  likely triggered by recent grief and stress. This syndrome often mimics symptoms of a heart attack and is characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium. In this patient's case  her hypertension  age  and gender also put her at greater risk.  Plan:  The treatment for takotsubo cardiomyopathy is largely supportive  with care focused on managing symptoms. The patient will need to be monitored closely in the hospital for 3-5 days. Ace inhibitors and beta blockers can be used to help the heart muscle recover  and symptoms will slowly abate over the course of a few weeks to months.  Note:  Considering the emotional stress she is experiencing  referral to a grief counselor or mental health professional may be beneficial for her overall well-being and prevents recurrence of the syndrome.

She also reported feeling excessively tired and weak recently  which is unusual for her.   Objective Findings:  Physical examination revelaed elevated blood pressure and heart rate. EKG showed ST-elevations  commonly associated with heart attack  but subsequent angiography showed no occlusion of the coronary arteries. Echocardiography showed a peculiar pattern of left ventricular contraction  reminiscent of the shape of a Japanese octopus trap  aka 'Takotsubo'. This is a rare kind of heart failure often triggered by severe stress  frequently misdiagnosed as myocardial infarction.  Mental and social health:  The patient lives alone  which concerns her children as she is currently unable to care for herself due to physical weakness. She has been suffering from depressive symptoms since her husband's death. She denies any substance use or alcohol abuse. She has a strong support network including two attentive and involved adult children who live nearby.   Required Follow-up and Treatment:  The patient needs close follow-up and management of her myocardial damage due to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This includes medications like ACE inhibitors  beta blockers  and diuretics for symptomatic relief and correction of the wall motion abnormality as well as continuous monitoring. Emotional health support including therapy and possibly antidepressants will also be necessary considering the connection between stress and the onset of this condition. The family may need to consider home health assistance or a move to assisted living until the patient can manage independently again."

Preliminary Diagnosis:  The patient recently lost her husband and has been under severe emotional stress  which  along with her symptoms  suggests a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""". This condition is known to predominantly affect post-menopausal women and can be triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. The condition usually mimics symptoms of a heart attack  including chest pain and shortness of breath. This condition often presents with left ventricular dysfunction and transient systolic dysfunction of the apical and/or mid segments of the left ventricle (which gives it a distinctive shape similar to a Japanese octopus trap  hence the name """"takotsubo"""").  Lab Tests/Imaging:  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) to detect abnormal rhythm or heart attack indicators. - Cardiac biomarker tests to check for elevated levels of cardiac enzymes  a sign of heart muscle damage. - Echocardiogram to visualize heart's motion and identify abnormalities. - Coronary angiogram to rule out coronary artery disease  another potential cause of the patient's symptoms. - Cardiac MRI if necessary  to confirm the diagnosis and assess extent of damage.  Treatment Plan:  - ACE inhibitors to reduce heart's workload and lower blood pressure. - Beta blockers to decrease heart rate and blood pressure. - Diuretics if fluid buildup is present. - Anti-anxiety or anti-depressants medication adjustment based on psychiatry consult. - Regular follow-up appointments to monitor condition and adjust treatment as necessary. - Referral to counseling or support groups to aid in emotional stress.  - Once recovered  a cardiac rehabilitation program to strengthen the heart and reduce the risk of future cardiac events."

Hypertension: The patient has been suffering from hypertension for the past 10 years. She has been taking antihypertensive medication  specifically  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.  2. Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed 8 years ago; she has been on lipid-lowering medication  statins.  3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 5 years ago.

Presenting Problem:  The patient presents to the ER with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain is severe  radiating to the back and left arm. She reports feeling nauseous and light-headed. She also expressed extreme anxiety over the sudden nature of these symptoms.  Given the acute symptoms of chest pain and the history of prolonged stress  a typical diagnosis like takotsubo cardiomyopathy is highly likely - it is a kind of stress-induced cardiomyopathy usually occurring in postmenopausal women. However  further diagnostic evaluation including ECG  cardiac biomarkers  and possible cardiac catheterization would be needed to confirm this diagnosis and ensure it is not an acute coronary syndrome.

15,6,69,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial69,"Patient Profile:  Identification:  Mrs. Florence Hancock  an-school teacher aged 65 years and of Asian ethnicity.  Home Situation: She lives with her husband in the suburbs. They have three adult children  who are all married and live fairly close by.   Occupation: Recently retired from a teaching career in a local high school.  Lifestyle Factors: Non-smoker and takes alcohol only occasionally  usually during family gatherings or holiday seasons. Tries to maintain a balanced diet and do moderate physical activities. She has a significant amount of stress in her life  mainly due to various family problems.  Past Medical History: She has type 2 diabetes  which is controlled through medication (Metformin) and a healthy diet. Hypertension was diagnosed five years ago  controlled via medication (Lisinopril). She has no history of cardiovascular disease or major surgeries.   Family History: Her father died from a sudden heart attack at the age of 70. Her mother had breast cancer  which was detected early and treated successfully. Two of her elder brothers are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Presenting Problem: A week ago  following the sudden death of her sister  Mrs. Hancock has started experiencing severe chest pain  characterized as a """"crushing"""" sensation  along with shortness of breath  nausea  and excessive sweating. The symptoms are reminiscent of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack)  however  upon examination at the hospital  no occlusive coronary artery disease was found. Echocardiography showed an abnormal ballooning of the apex of the heart with preserved function of the base which is indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Adding Context:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  often triggers severe chest pain and heart attack-like symptoms. It may be caused by the heart's reaction to a surge of stress hormones  usually as a result of intense physical or emotional stress. Around 90% of reported cases are in women ages 58 to 75."
15,6,70,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial70,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information: The patient is a 68-year-old post-menopausal woman. She is Caucasian and of non-Hispanic origin. She is a retired professional and lives alone. She is a widow and has a moderate socioeconomic status. She has two children who live in another state. She is non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally.    Presenting Problem: The patient presents with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath that began suddenly. The patient describes the pain as a severe  crushing pain in the center of her chest  radiating to her left arm and jaw. She admits to experiencing a high level of emotional stress due to recent death of her long term pet. Her symptoms were initially suspected as an acute coronary syndrome.  Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which she is on medication including a beta-blocker and a statin respectively. She has no known history of coronary artery disease  myocardial infarction  congestive heart failure  valvular disorders  or any other cardiac conditions. She is yet to experience menopause-related complications. Her family history is remarkable for diabetes mellitus in her mother.   Clinical Examination: On examination  the patient appears anxious. Her vital signs reveal a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  respiratory rate of 20 breathes per minute  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Cardiac examination reveals no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.   Investigations: An electrocardiogram is suggestive of ST-segment elevation  premature ventricular contractions  and T-wave inversion. Her cardiac biomarkers including CK-MB and troponin I levels are elevated. Echocardiogram shows apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperdynamic function of the basal walls which is not consistent with a single coronary artery distribution leading towards the diagnosis of tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy.   Impression: The combination of the patient's demographic profile (postmenopausal female)  her high level of emotional stress  characteristic symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath  elevated cardiac biomarkers  ECG changes and hallmark signs on echocardiogram  all suggest a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome.   Plan: The patient is started on appropriate management as per guidelines for takotsubo cardiomyopathy including supportive care  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics. The patient's family is contacted to provide emotional support. She is also referred to a counselor/psychologist for management of her stress and grief. The patient is educated about her diagnosis  risk factors  and the importance of avoiding excessive stress. Long term follow-up is arranged to monitor for the risk of recurrence and potential complications.
15,6,71,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial71,Patient Profile:  Patient Identifier: 001-002-003  Patient Name: Nancy Thompson   Age: 58  Gender: Female  Race: Caucasian  Occupational Information: Recently retired school teacher  Presenting Issue:  Ms. Thompson has sought medical attention for sudden and severe chest pain  which started after she received news of her older sister's sudden demise.  Medical History:  1. Prehypertension: In the past few checkups  Ms. Thompson was noted to have slightly elevated blood pressure  coupled with heightened stress and anxiety levels due to recent retirement from work and financial worries.   2. Anxiety disorder: Ms. Thompson was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder approximately four years ago. She has been on low-dose anti-anxiety medication since.  3. No known history of coronary artery disease or any other heart diseases.  4. Non-smoker  moderate alcohol intake.  5. Mom died of myocardial infarction at the age of 70  dad died of stroke at the age of 62.   Presenting Symptoms:  1. Severe chest pain: The chief complaint of Ms. Thompson is severe chest pain  which is typical of an acute coronary syndrome.  2. Shortness of breath: Accompanying the chest pain is a noticeable breathlessness.  3. Anxiety and emotional distress: Ms. Thompson is evidently in a state of emotional distress following the sudden news of her sister's death.  Possible Diagnosis:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome): The clinical syndrome of Ms. Thompson  which includes severe chest pain and breathlessness following a major emotional stressor  suggests a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition often mimics an acute coronary syndrome but is distinguished by transient left ventricular apical ballooning in the absence of relevant coronary artery stenosis. The explicit stressor here is the sudden death of a close family member  which is a known trigger for this condition. Further diagnostic testing (e.g.  imaging studies  coronary angiography) will be necessary to confirm.

She is post-menopause and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder six years ago. - Family Health History: Jane's mother died of a stroke at 72  and her father had coronary artery disease. Her younger sister has type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol. - Current Medications: Jane is currently on Lisinopril for her hypertension and takes Sertraline for her depression. She also takes Xanax as needed for anxiety attacks. - Allergies: Known allergy to Penicillin  with reactions involving rashes. - Substance usage: Jane reported moderate alcohol consumption (3 drinks per week)  and she quit smoking 15 years ago. She does not use recreational drugs. - Lifestyle: Sedentary job as an office worker  with limited exercise. Unhealthy diet includes high consumption of red meat and processed foods.  Recent Major Life Stressors:  Jane lost her husband of 40 years three months before presenting symptoms. Since the loss  her anxiety attacks and depressive episodes have increased. She showed symptoms of acute stress and was unable to handle her husband's death  including dealing with all the responsibilities previously shared with him.  Conclusion:  Given her presenting symptoms  recent major life stressors  age  gender  and history of hypertension and anxiety  a likely diagnosis for Jane is takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome). This condition is often triggered by severe stress and presents with symptoms similar to those of a heart attack.

She has three adult children who live out of town but visit frequently. She is physically active and enjoys gardening and taking walks in her neighborhood. Before retirement  Mrs. Barker was a stress-heavy profession - a high school teacher. Since her husband passed away three years ago from lung cancer  she also deals with intense emotional stress and grief.  Presenting Problem: Recently  Mrs. Barker had an intense squabble with her neighbor over a property dispute which left her extremely upset. Following this incident  she reported experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain  which lasted for a couple of hours. Having never experienced such symptoms before  she quickly sought emergency medical attention the next day.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Barker has a known history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hyperlipidaemia for over a decade. There is no known history of CVD  hypertension  or stroke. She is generally compliant with her medications - Metformin and Simvastatin. Mrs. Barker has not reported any smoking history. She doesn't consume alcohol regularly  only occasional wine during special occasions. She has no known drug allergies.   Family History: Her father had a heart attack at age 56  and her mother lived up to 83 with Type 2 Diabetes. Her older brother  aged 70  is currently living with coronary artery disease and hypertension. The patient's husband  Mr. Barker  expired due to complications of lung cancer secondary to heavy smoking. There is no family history of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  This information forms the basis of a problem representation for a typical patient presenting with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Mrs. Barker is a classic example due to her demographic profile  her history of chronic disease  and the acute stressful event that led to her symptoms.

The patient is under medication for both conditions. - She has a history of occasional palpitations but has not previously sought any medical consultation regarding this. - She has gone through menopause and is not on any hormone replacement therapy. - Family history indicates her mother suffered from heart disease.   Current Presentation: - Patient came to the emergency department complaining about severe chest pain  similar to a heart attack. Pain began suddenly after receiving emotionally upsetting news. - She reports symptoms including shortness of breath  palpitations  and excessive sweating. - She has feelings of impending doom  consistent with panic or anxiety attack.  This patient profile suggests a possible presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  which is a temporary heart condition often brought on by stressful situations. This condition displays symptoms similar to those of a heart attack and is more common in post-menopausal women. The patient's age  gender  ongoing stress  anxiety disorder  and existing cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension  hyperlipidemia) point towards a high likelihood of this condition. It's important to confirm the diagnosis through further cardiac assessment including ECG  blood tests  and possibly an echocardiogram or heart MRI. "
15,6,75,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial75,Patient Profile:  Name: Jane Doe Age: 68 years old Gender: Female  Race: Caucasian  Occupity: Retired Office Worker  Presenting Problem: The patient complains of sudden  severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She reports that these symptoms began suddenly  shortly after hearing about her daughter’s car accident.   Past Medical History: • Asthma  diagnosed 10 years ago • Hypothyroidism  diagnosed 2 years ago • History of severe anxiety and panic attacks  diagnosed 15 years ago • Recently suffered a major emotional stressor (serious family accident) • Non-smoker  occasional alcohol drink • Follows a balanced diet and engages in minimal physical exercise • No prior history of any heart diseases or stroke  Family History: • Mother suffered from hypertension in her later years • Father had a heart attack at age 75 • One sibling with Type-2 diabetes • No early deaths in the family   Current Medication: • Ventolin for asthma • Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism • Sertraline for anxiety  Review of Systems: The patient states that she has not had any recent fevers  chills  or weight loss. She does  however  reveal a general sense of fatigue and a mild lingering cough.  Physical Examination:  Resting BP: 145/90 Heart rate: 90 BPM Respiratory rate: 16 breathes per minute Temperature: 98.6 Fahrenheit Cardiovascular examination reveals no abnormalities.  In this case  the patient’s acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath after a distressing life event  as well a her lack of previous underlying heart complication  suggest a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or broken heart syndrome. This should  however  be confirmed through further diagnostic tests  such as an echocardiogram and/or a cardiac MRI.
15,6,76,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial76,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   Mrs. L  a 60-year-old Caucasian woman from an urban setting presents to the emergency department.   Current Situation:  The patient is complaining of severe chest pain similar to a heart attack. She confirms it started suddenly  in the midst of an emotionally overwhelming situation. On a pain scale from 1 to 10  she rates her pain as a 9.   Demographic details:  The patient lives independently. She is a retired librarian  a widow for 10 years and has three adult children. The patient is a non-smoker and does not report any use of alcohol or recreational drugs.   Medical and Family History:  Mrs. L has a history of hypertension controlled with medications (hydrochlorothiazide) and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 5 years back which is being managed through dietary control and medication (Metformin). She has a BMI of 28.3 kg/m^2. She has no known allergies. She had a cholecystectomy 20 years ago. She reports an occasional episode of palpitations but has no past medical history of heart disease or high cholesterol. She has no family history of premature coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular diseases.  Recent Changes and Stressful Events:  Patient’s mother recently passed away which has brought on significant emotional stress. She also reported experiencing episodes of anxiety and occasional panic attacks since her mother's death.  Medication History:  Mrs. L is currently taking metformin for her diabetes and hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension.  Risk Factors:  She has a history of hypertension and diabetes which are risk factors for heart disease. She is also under significant emotional stress which is a known precipitant for takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Clinical Findings:  On presentation  her Blood pressure was elevated at 160/90 mmHg and pulse rate was 110 beats per minute. An EKG shows ST segment elevations. Results from an echo cardiogram indicate apical ballooning of the left ventricle  a typical feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and a troponin test also reports higher levels.   Patient's Symptoms in line with problem:  Her chest pain is severe  similar to the pain experienced during a heart attack  she has a history of hypertension and occasional palpitations. Her recent emotionally stressful event (mother's death) along with the clinical findings all point towards a potential diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Management:  Pending consultant cardiologist review  she should be reassured and given initial treatment to relieve symptoms and stabilize her condition. In general  treatment of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is usually supportive and similar to the treatment given for an acute coronary syndrome.  This is a typical problem representation for a patient with a suspected diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. However  each patient may vary  and this representation should be adjusted based on the individual case presentation.
15,6,77,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial77,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   67-year-old Caucasian female presenting with symptoms consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Presenting Symptoms:   The patient reports having experienced sudden  severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She described the pain as being similar to that experienced during a heart attack. The patient also reveals having gone through a severe emotional stress event an hour before the onset of these symptoms.  Significant Past Medical History:  1. Experienced a panic attack two years ago  which was managed with clinical intervention and has not had a recurrence since.  2. Has been managing her Type 2 diabetes for 15 years  which has been regulated through medication and diet modification.  3. Diagnosed with Hypertension 10 years ago  which is currently managed with medication.  4. The patient suffered from a major depressive disorder diagnosed 5 years ago  and it's under control with the help of psychotherapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication.  5. Smoker for the last 25 years  decreasing from 1 pack per day to 1-2 cigarettes per day in the past 5 years.  6. Regular alcohol consumer: approximately 2 drinks per day.  Relevant Given Family History:  Mother suffered a stroke at age 75. Maternal grandfather had heart disease.   Physical Examination:  1. Blood Pressure is elevated at 160/95 mmHg.  2. Pulse rate is irregular and fast  with a rate of 110 beats/min.  Impressions:  Given the severe chest pain combined with the patient's past medical history - especially the episode of the panic attack  diabetes  hypertension  and regular tobacco and alcohol use - the patient has a substantial risk factors profile. The stressful event prior to the onset of symptoms  anecdotal to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy presentation  is also notable.

These symptoms started two hours ago  soon after she received news of a relative's sudden death.  Past Medical History:   Mrs. Doe has a history of hypertension  managed with medication (Enalapril) for the past 10 years. She has been trying to manage her levels of stress after her husband's death but admits difficulty doing so. She does not have a history of any heart disease.  Family History:   Her father had coronary artery disease and passed away at 65 due to heart attack. Her mother is alive  aged 80  and suffers from Type 2 diabetes.   Review of Systems:   On further questioning  Mrs. Doe also complained of feelings of anxiety and occasional bouts of fatigue. She had been feeling particularly stressed and anxious over the past week after getting news that her sister  whom she was very close to  was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had been crying a lot and had trouble sleeping the past several days.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  she appears visibly anxious and in pain. The rest of her physical examination is essentially normal with no sign of heart failure or other acute conditions.  Objective Data:  The ECG shows ST-segment elevation  simulating an acute myocardial infarction. However  cardiac biomarkers reveal mildly elevated troponin T levels  which are discordant with the ECG changes  and her echocardiography reveals systolic apical ballooning with preserved basal function  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (or broken heart syndrome).

The chest pain is central  radiating to the left arm  with a squeezing character  gets worse on exertion  and is associated with exertional breathlessness. The onset of chest pain is not related to food intake and it does not change with postural variations. There is no prior history of similar chest pain and she does not have any chronic cough or weight loss.   Given the sudden onset of distress  chest pain  and her recent series of stressful events  the differential diagnosis includes takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The condition mimics heart attack symptoms and is often triggered by severe stress but does not involve the coronary arteries. Hence  it is often known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". Prompt evaluation and management are needed to address her symptoms and rule out other possible life-threatening conditions.   The description above provides problem representation for a typical patient presenting with takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
15,6,86,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial86,Problem Representation:  Patient Info:  - Patient: 67-year-old Asian woman  - Occupation: Retired school teacher - Marital status: Widowed  - Children: Two children (lives with a daughter) - Lifestyle: Non-smoker  occasional alcohol  regular exercise  Presenting Problem:  The patient presents with chest pain  shortness of breath  and mild fatigue following a severe emotional distress that occurred a week ago.   Past Medical History:  - The patient has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  under medication control  which has resulted in her lifestyle changes (regular exercise  low-salt  and low-fat diet).  - She was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid two years ago.  - She had a difficult year after the loss of her spouse  suffering grief and depression  for which she attended regular counseling but no pharmacologic therapy was necessary.  - There are no reports of previous similar incidents  nor has any prevalent heart disease been diagnosed before this event.  - She underwent hysterectomy due to marked uterine fibroids at the age of 45.  - She has no known drug allergies.  Investigations: - An EKG  cardiac enzymes such as troponin and CK-MB tests have been ordered to evaluate the cause of chest pain.  - An echocardiography and coronary angiography were performed based on her symptoms and age though no significant blockages were found  but a peculiar  balloon-shaped pattern in the left ventricle (LV) with characteristic apical ballooning was noticed  thus  clinching the diagnosis.  Treatment: Currently  she is admitted for observation and symptom management and is given beta-blockers to lower the heart rate and blood pressure. Additional interventions are being considered based upon symptom progression and response to the initial treatment.  Family History: Her mother succumbed to a stroke at the age of 72  and her father had prostate cancer in his late 70s. Her older sister is living with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.
15,6,87,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial87,Patient Representation:  Subject: Ms. Turner  a 58-year-old  Caucasian  female  Demographics: Ms. Turner is an unmarried woman who recently retired from her job as a high school principal. She lives alone but has a supportive network of friends and family nearby. She is moderately active  non-smoker  and drinks alcohol occasionally. She maintains a balanced diet and regularly takes her prescribed medications.   Relevant Medical History: Ms. Turner has a history of hypertension  controlled with medication  and suffered a mild stroke two years ago. She recovered well with no residual neurological deficits. She has no known incidences of heart disease in the family. She is not diabetic but has occasional episodes of anxiety due to the stress of her previous job. She has also previously been diagnosed with hypothyroidism.  Recent Health Issues: Ms. Turner recently experienced an intensely stressful event with the sudden death of her brother. Soon after  she experienced severe chest pain similar to that of a heart attack and was rushed to the ER. Cardiac enzymes were elevated  and an ECG indicated changes suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. However  a coronary angiogram viewed normal coronary arteries. Instead  the distal part of the left ventricle was noted to have abnormal contractions  resembling a takotsubo  a Japanese octopus pot  leading the physician to suspect takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Current Symptoms: Ms. Turner's symptoms include chest pain and shortness of breath. She also mentioned having palpitations and a sense of impending doom  likely secondary to anxiety.  Current Medications: 1. Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension 2. Levothyroxine 75 micrograms daily for hypothyroidism 3. Aspirin 81mg daily for stroke prevention 4. Occasional benzodiazepines (lorazepam) for anxiety  as needed  Risk Factors: - Post-menopausal state: The majority of takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurs in postmenopausal women. - Hypertension: Ms. Turner has a known history of hypertension. - Acute psychological stress: Recently experienced due to the sudden loss of her brother. - History of anxiety disorder   Clinical Examination and Laboratory Evaluations: Physical exam  blood work  chest x-ray  ECG  echocardiography  and coronary angiography would be performed to better understand her heart's current state.

Background: She has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She reports having been under severe emotional stress due to the recent death of her husband.  Family History: Mother passed away due to myocardial infarction age 79 and father had diabetes. Her younger brother has hypertension.  Social History: Ms. Smith lives alone after the recent loss of her husband. She has three children who live nearby and interact with her frequently. She is physically active and often participates in social activities in her community.  Medications: - Lisinopril 10mg once daily for hypertension - Simvastatin 20mg once daily at night for hyperlipidemia  Allergies:  She has no known drug allergies.   Relevant physical examination:  She appears acutely ill  and tachypneic. Blood pressure is 165/95  heart rate is regular at 102 bpm  SpO2 is 94% on room air.  The problem representation:  A 72-year-old Caucasian female with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  recently bereaved  now presents with sudden onset chest pain and dyspnea. Physical exam reveals an acutely ill  tachypneic patient with high blood pressure and tachycardia. The patient's presentation and past medical history suggest a possible diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken-heart syndrome)  a potentially life-threatening heart disease typically triggered by severe emotional stress.
15,6,89,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial89,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information: Ms. Samantha  a 61-year-old Caucasian female  presents in the emergency department with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. She works as a high school teacher and lives by herself.  Past Medical History: The patient doesn't have any history of cardiovascular diseases. However  she had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2  which is currently being managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. She also suffered from hypertension diagnosed five years ago that has been controlled with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Samantha is not a smoker and doesn't consume alcohol. She maintains a balanced diet and tries to exercise regularly.  Recent Life Events:  She recently lost her only son in a road accident a week ago. It was a severe emotional trauma for her  and she has been in extreme distress since then.  Presenting Complaint:  She arrived at the emergency department complaining about sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath that started a few hours ago. The pain is severe  located in the center of the chest  radiating to the left arm  and not relieved by rest or traditional remedies.  Assuming that her emotional trauma acted as a potent trigger  the possibility of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (broken-hearted syndrome) is considered. The patient's recent emotional distress  current symptoms mimicking a heart attack (but without significant coronary artery disease history) all point towards this transient heart condition. Further tests including electrocardiogram (ECG)  cardiac enzymes  and echocardiogram to visualize wall motion abnormalities are required to confirm the diagnosis.

She claims to have been feeling symptoms of anxiety and difficulty sleeping since then.  Diagnostic Tests: Echocardiography and coronary angiogram conducted to conclude on the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography showed apical ballooning. Angiogram findings show no significant coronary artery disease that would cause the cardiac symptoms and changes in ECG.  Problem Representation: 61-year-old Caucasian female  with a history of hypertension  recently faced with severe emotional distress  presenting with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows abnormalities  but angiogram and echocardiography findings lead to the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (stress cardiomyopathy). The patient is in need of appropriate management and follow-up care to prevent complications.

This problem representation suggests the possibility of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  acute stress-induced heart condition  commonly known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". Further diagnostic testing  including blood tests for cardiac biomarkers and perhaps echocardiography  would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis and rule out a myocardial infarction (a heart attack). The patient would likely benefit from referral to a cardiologist and perhaps a psychologist or psychiatrist to help manage the stress and emotional trauma. Results from these consultations would then guide the development of a treatment plan."
15,6,92,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial92,Problem Representation:  Demographic Characterization:  A 68 year-old post-menopausal Caucasian female with an average body mass index  living in urban setup  a retired bank clerk  currently residing with her 70 year-old husband. Acknowledges occasional alcohol use and has history of smoking  although she quit 15 years back. No known allergies recorded. Her socio-economic status is average.  Relevant Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension for last 20 years and moderate hyperlipidemia  both managed by medications. She also has documented osteoarthritis of both knees for last 10 years and takes over-the-counter NSAIDs as needed. Recently  she was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  onset linked to the sudden death of her older brother due to myocardial infarction a year back.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented to emergency department with severe  sudden-onset central chest pain that radiates to the left arm and jaw  accompanied by shortness of breath  palpitations and profuse sweating. The symptoms appeared while she was watching a thriller movie  where an intense and emotionally distressing scene caused her to feel extreme fear and terror.   On examination  her blood pressure was recorded as 150/90 mmHg  heart rate 110bpm  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute and saturating 96% on room air. She looked anxious  was in distress due to pain but was coherent and oriented to time  place and person.  Preliminary investigations  including an ECG  showed ST-segment elevations  mimicking an acute myocardial infarction. Further confirming tests like echocardiogram and coronary angiogram were ordered.  The potential diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as Broken Heart Syndrome) is made as suspicion is raised by her clinical presentation  particularly the link between an emotional trigger and onset of symptoms  along with her EKG changes. The further investigations will help to confirm the diagnosis and rule out differential diagnoses such as Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)  Myocardial Infarction (MI)  etc.

Both maternal and paternal grandparents had diabetes.  Presenting Problem:  Mrs. Williams has recently been feeling faint and exhausted after her usual daily activities. She has also experienced chest pain and shortness of breath over the last week. This caused her concern  as she leads an otherwise healthy lifestyle with regular moderate exercise and balanced diet.  Past Medical History:  1. Has been diagnosed with hypertension and been on medication for the past five years. 2. Recently went through the intense emotional strain of the death of her husband  six months ago. 3. Had gone through a major depressive episode during her late 40s. 4.

Relevant personal history:  She is a non-smoker and does drink moderately  only socially. She has been consistent with her hypertension medications and has regular follow-ups with her physician.  Clinical representation of the problem:  The symptoms - chest pain  faintness  and difficulty breathing – along with the past history of hypertension and significant emotional stress  potentially point towards takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""". This is a temporary heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations  such as the death of a loved one. People with this condition may have sudden chest pain and think they're having a heart attack. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is usually reversible  but it's important that it's caught early to avoid serious complications like heart failure."

She states that these symptoms started suddenly after she got to know about her son's death last week.   Medical History:  - Has a history of hypertension for which she is not on regular medication. - Regular screenings revealed no evidence of any cardiovascular disease. - Previous reports of occasional migraines. - No history of surgeries or major illnesses. - Family history consists of a father with type 2 diabetes and a mother with hypertension. No reported family history of heart disease.  Primary Care Physician Examinations:  After examination of Mrs. H  the doctor noticed: - Physical examination revealed no cyanosis  clubbing or edema.  - Chest was clear on auscultation  but she has tachycardia - EKG revealed changes typically seen with patients who have had a severe heart attack.   Hospital Course and Evaluation:  - Admitted immediately due to presenting symptoms suggestive of Acute Coronary Syndrome. - Causes of chest pain other than cardiac etiology does not seem fitting based on history and symptoms.  - Test revealed elevated cardiac enzymes. - Coronary angiogram showed no significant blockages that typically cause a heart attack  but abnormalities in her heart’s left ventricle. - Echocardiogram showed ballooning and weakening of left ventricle.  Diagnosis:  Based on the findings  Mrs. H was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or Broken Heart Syndrome. The condition is characterized by a temporary sudden weakening of the heart muscle  most often triggered by intense physical or emotional stress  precisely in her case - an overwhelming grief caused by loss of her child. She likely had a healthy heart previously  hence no symptoms until this stressful event. Despite the condition itself mimics symptoms of a heart attack  there are no blocked arteries  a typical factor with heart attacks.
15,6,99,diagnosis15-prompt6-trial99,Problem Representation:   Case: Mrs. A  a 64-year-old postmenopausal woman  presents to the emergency department experiencing severe chest pain  similar to that of a heart attack. She describes her pain as sudden onset  severe  and pressure-like spreading to the back. It is associated with mild dyspnea.   Demographic Profile:  - Gender: Female - Age: 64 years - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired teacher - Marital Status: Widow - Living Status: Alone  Past Medical History:   - Post-menopausal  - No known prior cardiac disease  - No history of high blood pressure or diabetes  - Negative for smoking and alcohol use  - Negative for drug abuse - History of mild asthma  - History of generalized anxiety disorder   Recent Major Life Events:   Mrs. A recently lost her spouse of 30 years.  Salient Features:  - Severe chest pain - Mild dyspnea  - Absence of coronary artery disease  - Widowed with a history of generalized anxiety disorder - Recent bereavement   Problem:   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often known as broken-heart syndrome  is being suspected. The condition is often triggered by severe emotional stress  such as the loss of a spouse. The symptoms mimic those of a heart attack and typically occur in post-menopausal women. Most people affected by takotsubo cardiomyopathy do not have any known heart disease history  and this correlates with this patient’s lack of prior cardiac issues. It is proposed that the patient’s severe chest pain and dyspnea are due to the sudden release of stress hormones causing part of the heart to enlarge temporarily and not pump well  while the rest of the heart functions normally or with even more forceful contractions.   Further confirmatory tests are necessary to determine the diagnosis and appropriate treatment. With supportive medical care  most people recover completely from takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

This profile provides a preliminary view of the patient's background and current status but further diagnostic tests  including ECG  echocardiogram  and blood tests  would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
15,7,1,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial1,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Female  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is a condition in which extreme stress impairs the heart's ability to pump  often triggered by serious physical illness or extreme emotional stress. The following classic case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy discusses a post-menopausal woman who developed symptoms following a stressful incidence.  Case Presentation: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female who was presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute onset of severe chest pain and dyspnea. The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes mellitus type 2  for which she is taking amlodipine  simvastatin  and metformin  respectively.  The patient  a retired teacher  lives with her husband and has two adult children. She has a 20-pack year history of smoking  which ceased 15 years ago. She consumes alcohol socially and denies illicit drug use.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  the patient was anxious  with a heart rate of 112 beats/minute  blood pressure of 152/90 mmHg  respirations of 22/minute  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The cardiac examination revealed tachycardia without murmurs  rubs  or gallops. The patient’s lungs were clear on auscultation and her troponin was elevated at 1.3 ng/mL.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: ECG showed ST segment elevation in the anterior leads suggestive of anterior wall myocardial infarction. A subsequent coronary angiogram  however  did not reveal any significant obstructive coronary artery disease that would explain the electrocardiographic changes and her presenting symptoms.  An echocardiogram was performed revealing apical ballooning of the left ventricle  a classic sign of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. These results were consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy using the Mayo Clinic diagnostic criteria.  The patient reported that her symptoms started shortly after she received distressing news of her brother's sudden death  suggesting that her condition was likely precipitated by extreme emotional stress.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment: The patient was managed with supportive therapy  intravenous nitroglycerin for chest pain  and was closely monitored in the Intensive Care Unit for any complications.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: Repeated echocardiography after a week showed normalization of the left ventricular function without any wall motion abnormality. The patient made a good recovery and was discharged with advice to undergo psychological counseling.  Discussion: While the exact cause of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is not known  extreme stress seems to affect the heart muscle and its ability to pump. This case emphasises the need for the consideration of this diagnosis in post-menopausal women with chest pain and ECG changes  especially in the context of emotional stress  despite the absence of significant coronary artery disease.   Patient Perspective: The patient felt relieved understanding the cause of her symptoms and was grateful for the care and support provided by the medical team. She agreed to consider psychological counseling to manage stress better in the future.  Informed Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images. 
15,7,2,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial2,Title: Acute Stress-Induced (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy in a Middle-Aged Female: A Case Report  Patient Profile: A 59-year-old Caucasian female  employed as a high school teacher  presented at the emergency department at 7:23 pm on 20/05/2022.  Demographics: The patient lives in an urban area  has a stable family life with two grown-up children and a supportive husband  and is a non-smoker. She has no known drug allergies. This patient has lived a physically active life  with no recorded unhealthy dietary habits or substance abuse issues. She has no family history of cardiovascular disease. Her Body Mass Index (BMI) is classified as 'normal' (21.7 kg/m2).  Past Medical History: The patient had a diagnosed history of anxiety and depression and was on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the last ten years. Incidentally  the patient had been experiencing higher stress levels in the past few months due to work. She does not have any history of hypertension  diabetes mellitus  respiratory  kidney  or gastrointestinal diseases. She had her menopause at the age of 52 years and was not on any hormonal replacement therapy.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the upper left arm and associated with shortness of breath and palpitations since 01:00 pm on the same day. There was no history of cough  fever  orthopnea  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  or prior similar episodes.  Clinical Examination: Physical examination revealed tachycardia  with a heart rate of 110 beats/min  and blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg. The rest of the physical examination  including cardiovascular  respiratory  and abdominal examination  showed no abnormal findings.  Investigations: An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  suggestive of acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. Laboratory tests showed raised troponin levels. However  the coronary angiogram was surprising as it reported no significant coronary artery disease. An echocardiogram was conducted  which showed apical ballooning consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Discussion: Given the clinical picture and the results of investigations  the patient was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  likely precipitated by significant work stress  despite a lack of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.  Treatment: The patient was treated supportively with beta blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and reassurance. Her SSRIs were continued and a referral was made for further psychological support.  Outcome: The patient's symptoms improved over a period of a few days  and she was discharged home with close outpatient follow-up.  Final Remarks: This case report underscores the importance of recognizing takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in acute chest pain  especially in postmenopausal women with a history of psychiatric illness and recent stressful events. This diagnosis necessitates a different therapeutic approach than acute coronary syndrome  focusing on symptomatic relief and stress management.

Presenting Complaint: The patient presented with acute-onset chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  and a feeling of impending doom  which began approximately 2 hours earlier while attending a graveside service of a close friend.   Hospital Admission: Upon admission to the hospital  vital signs revealed the patient had tachycardia and hypertension. Her blood pressure was 150/100 mmHg and heart rate was elevated at 112 beats per minute.   Investigations: Cardiac enzyme tests revealed a slightly elevated level of Troponin T at 0.04 ng/ml. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads and deep T-wave inversions. An echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction at 45%  suggesting the possibility of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Medical management: The patient was commenced on aspirin  a beta-blocker  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor  and a statin as per management of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Also  she was given intravenously administered nitroglycerin for acute hypertension management and better coronary perfusion.  Further Tests: To exclude ACS  coronary angiography was performed  revealing normal coronary arteries  which confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   Outcome and follow up: The patient’s symptoms started subsiding after 48 hours  and repeat echocardiogram done after 5 days from the episode  demonstrated normalized left ventricular function. She was discharged from the hospital in a stable condition after 7 days  with outpatient follow up recommendations. As part of the follow-up  behavioral therapy was advised considering her prior depression diagnosis and the possibility of psychological stress playing a role in her cardiac event.  Conclusion: This case recapitulates the clinical presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which mimics acute coronary syndrome  often induced by severe emotional stress. Even though this condition often affects post-menopausal women  it should be considered in differential diagnosis irrespective of gender and age  when patients present with chest pain  especially with triggering emotional or physical stress. Furthermore  psychological intervention should be an integral part of the therapy.
15,7,4,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial4,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in an Elderly Female with History of Hypertension   Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is a condition characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction  commonly triggered by acute emotional or physical stress. This condition mimics the clinical features of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but has no obstructive coronary disease on angiography. Most cases of TTC are typically identified in post-menopausal women.  Case Report:  The patient is a 74-year-old Caucasian female presenting with severe chest pain radiating to her neck and left arm. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension  controlled with lisinopril  and a remote history of depression  treated with fluoxetine.   The patient reported that her chest pain began suddenly  several hours after hearing about her sister's unexpected passing. On examination  she had a blood pressure of 170/97 mmHg  pulse rate of 105 per minute  and respiratory rate of 22 per minute. Twelve-lead EKG indicated ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  raising the suspicion of an anterior wall myocardial infarction.  The patient was urgently moved to the catheterization lab where coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary artery disease. Left ventriculogram demonstrated apical ballooning with impaired systolic function which is consistent with TTC  leading to the diagnosis.  The patient was managed with supportive care including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics to control her blood pressure and heart rate and was monitored in the cardiac care unit for 72 hours. The case was complicated by transient left ventricular outflow tract obstruction treated with fluid resuscitation and cessation of ACE inhibitors.  Discussion:  In this case  the patient's chest symptoms  EKG changes  and the transient nature of the left ventricular dysfunction after emotional stress are all consistent with TTC  also known as broken heart syndrome. The stress of her sister's untimely death likely precipitated the TTC in this patient with pre-existing hypertension who presumably had heightened sympathetic activation.   This case highlights the need for physicians to consider TTC in the differential diagnosis for patients  particularly post-menopausal women  presenting with chest pain and ECG findings suggestive of ACS  especially in the context of recent severe emotional stress. Though the prognosis of TTC is usually favorable  complications can occur  as exemplified by this case where the patient developed transient outflow tract obstruction.   Detailed and informed care can lead to positive short and long-term outcomes for these cases. While treatment is primarily supportive and most patients recover within days to weeks  this condition can reoccur. Therefore  patients should be informed about the nature of the disease and the potential for recurrence with future stressors.

15,7,5,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial5,"Patient Information: Ms. J.R.  a 75-year-old Caucasian female.  Chief Complaint: Ms. J.R. presented at the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm along with episodes of lightheadedness. She reports that her symptoms commenced suddenly during a family gathering at which she received the shocking news of her younger brother's abrupt death.  Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  for which she has been taking medication (Lisinopril  10mg daily) for the past 10 years. She has no history of coronary artery disease  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or family history of cardiac-related diseases. She quit smoking around 20 years ago and consumes alcohol recreationally. She reports having an uneventful medical history except for occasional bouts of anxiety and depression  exacerbated by stressful events. The patient has been currently grieving the sudden loss of her younger brother  which she reports as a significantly stressful event.  Investigations: An electrocardiogram (EKG) was immediately performed  revealing ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads  suggestive of a possible anterolateral myocardial infarction. The patient's bloodwork showed elevated cardiac biomarkers— troponin T levels at 0.12 ng/mL(normal: <0.01 ng/mL). Complete blood count  renal function  and electrolytes were within normal limits. Chest X-ray yielded no conclusive anomalies.  Emergency coronary angiography did not reveal any significant coronary artery disease to account for the ST-segment elevation. An echocardiograph was then performed  showing akinesis of the apical and middle segments of the left ventricle and hyperkinesis of the basal walls  which is typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis: Based on these results  the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment: The patient was managed conservatively with heart failure medications: angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors)  beta-blockers  and diuretics. Additionally  she was also conscientiously monitored throughout her hospital stay.  Outcome and Follow-Up: After 5 days of hospitalization  the patient's symptoms improved significantly. Her chest pain and lightheadedness subsided completely. A repeat EKG demonstrated normalization of previous ST changes  and a follow-up echocardiogram showed significant improvement in the left ventricular function. The patient was discharged with a prescription for a beta-blocker (Metoprolol)  an ACE inhibitor  and a recommendation for follow-up consultations with a cardiologist and psychotherapy for grief management.  Conclusion: This is a classic presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" triggered by extreme emotional stress. With timely diagnosis and conservative management  the prognosis is generally good  and most of the patients recover completely. However  routine follow-up and psychological support form a crucial part of the management and recovery process."
15,7,6,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial6,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:  - Age: 67 - Sex: Female - Ethnicity: Asian - Occupation: Retired primary school teacher  Chief Complaint:  The patient presented to the emergency department with central chest pain and shortness of breath.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  both of which are well controlled with medication. She is a non-smoker and takes moderate alcohol. She has no known allergies. Her family history was negative for cardiac diseases.  Clinical Findings:  On presentation  the patient appeared in obvious distress  her blood pressure was 160/85 mmHg  pulse was 110 bpm  and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST-segment elevation in anterior leads. Initial blood tests revealed elevated levels of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).  Diagnostic Assessment:  Based on the presenting symptoms and the EKG changes  the initial suspicion was for an acute coronary syndrome. However  on performing an urgent coronary angiogram  no significant coronary artery disease was found. An echocardiography  instead  showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved basal function  characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) or 'broken heart syndrome'.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient received supportive care for her symptoms  with oxygen supplementation and nitroglycerin for her chest pain. Given her diagnosis of TCM  she was started on a beta blocker and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor  then switched to a calcium channel blocker due to a dry cough side effect.  Follow-up and Outcome:  She was discharged 5 days after admission with a decreased level of cTnT and BNP. At a 1-month follow-up appointment  she reported a remarkable reduction in symptoms. Follow up echocardiography at six weeks showed resolution of the left ventricular dysfunction with an improved ejection fraction. The beta blocker was slowly tapered off over a 3-month period.  Clinical Lessons:  This case highlights the importance of considering TCM as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome  especially in postmenopausal women with a history of psychological stressors. Prompt recognition of this condition can help in instituting appropriate management and preventing unnecessary interventions. It also underscores the necessity of a follow-up echocardiography in the differential diagnosis of chest pain.
15,7,7,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial7,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman - A Case Report  Patient Information: A 65-year-old Caucasian female presented at the Emergency Department with severe chest pain. The patient reported she lived alone  had recently retired from her job as a high-school teacher  and was a non-smoker with a moderate consumption of alcohol (5-10 drinks/week).  Clinical Findings: The patient described a sudden onset of chest pain radiating to the left arm with associated shortness of breath. She rated her pain as 8 on a scale of 10  which significantly worsened with exertion. She also reported experiencing an intense emotional stress event earlier in the day  consisting of finding out about her son's serious car accident.  Diagnostic Assessment: Electrocardiogram (ECG) at presentation showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior-septal and inferior leads. Initial troponins were slightly elevated  further raising the suspicion for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). However  coronary angiography did not reveal any significant blockages. Echocardiography displayed apical akinesis  basal hyperkinesis  and moderate left ventricular dysfunction; findings consistent with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Past Medical History: Patient's past medical history was significant for hypertension  controlled with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor  and hyperlipidemia  managed with statin therapy. She had no history of ischemic heart disease  diabetes  or known cardiac risk factors. She had no prior episodes of chest pain or discomfort.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was managed with standard heart failure treatment  including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics as needed for volume status. She reported subjective improvement of symptoms and was monitored in the cardiology ward.  Follow-up: The patient was discharged after four days of admission with a stable condition. She was continued on her previous antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatments and was also started on beta-blockers. At 1-month follow-up  repeat echocardiogram showed resolution of the previous wall-motion abnormalities with an improved left ventricular ejection fraction  confirming the diagnosis of TCM. The patient reported no residual symptoms and had returned to her normal level of activity.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the vital role of emotional stress as a trigger for TCM  otherwise known as 'broken heart syndrome'. The prompt diagnosis and appropriate management of these patients are essential for improving patient outcomes. It is also important to follow these patients closely  as recurrence of TCM has been reported in the literature. The patient was advised to seek mental counseling to cope with stressors in the future.
15,7,8,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial8,Title: An Unusual Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 58-year-old Caucasian Male  Patient Information:  Caucasian male  58 years old  married  residing in Greensboro  North Carolina. He is a non-smoker and a social drinker. He reports a sedentary lifestyle as a computer programmer with high levels of work-related stress. The patient has a history of mild hypertension  well-controlled with lisinopril. There are no recorded instances of heart disease in his family.  Clinical Findings:  The patient was brought in by ambulance following a sudden onset of severe chest pain with associated shortness of breath whilst at work. Vitals taken at emergency hospital admission showed - BP: 170/90 mmHg  HR: 101 bpm  RR: 20/min  SpO2: 96% on room air  Temp: 37.2°C. The initial examination revealed diaphoresis  tachycardia  and elevated blood pressure signs consistent with acute distress.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An EKG was promptly performed  suggesting ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However  subsequent cardiac catheterization did not reveal any significant coronary artery disease.  Laboratory investigations showed elevated troponin levels at 2.5 ng/ml (normal range: < 0.5 ng/mL) signifying myocardial injury.  Selected acute echocardiography revealed a markedly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% (normal range: 55-70%) and a distinctive pattern of apical ballooning with basal hypercontractility. These findings in the absence of significant obstructive coronary disease  favored a provisional diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC). An evaluation of his history revealed intense work stress just before the onset of symptoms.  Therapeutic Interventions:  Initially  aspirin and clopidogrel were given considering the provisional diagnosis of STEMI. However  once Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was diagnosed  heart failure management was initiated with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and diuretics. The patient was subsequently managed in the CCU until improvement of his cardiac function was evidenced on repeat echocardiography.  Follow Up and Outcomes:  Repeat echocardiography after the 4-week outpatient follow-up visit showed recovery of left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 62%. Troponin levels at follow-up were within the normal range. The patient reported adherence to medications and had incorporated regular physical activity and mindfulness practices into his routine to better manage his work-related stress.  Patient Perspective:  The patient expressed surprise about his diagnosis  as he was not aware that extreme stress could result in a heart condition mimicking a heart attack. He has made significant lifestyle modifications to avoid a similar event in the future.  Informed Consent:  The patient gave informed consent for this data to be published.  This case highlights the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome  particularly in the context of recent severe stress. An awareness and understanding of this condition can lead to appropriate management and favorable outcomes.
15,7,9,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial9,Case Report  Demographic Information:  The patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian female who presented to the Emergency Department (ED). She resides in a suburban neighborhood of Boston  Massachusetts  living with her husband and two retired university faculty. She is a retired school teacher who is now a part-time volunteer at a local charity organization. She has never smoked and drinks occasionally during social gatherings. Her BMI is 24.2 kg/m^2. She has no history of illicit drug use.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a medical history of hypertension for 20 years  for which she takes Lisinopril 20 mg daily. In the past  she demonstrated a moderately healthy lifestyle  exercising three times a week and maintaining a balanced diet with a low salt intake. She has no known allergies. She is without a history of diabetes mellitus  dyslipidemia  and has no known genetic disorders.   Presenting History:   The patient was brought to the ED by her husband. She was experiencing a sudden onset of chest discomfort  radiated to the back  along with shortness of breath  and nausea that started three hours prior to presentation. She mentioned that she had been under immense emotional stress for the last two weeks due to the sudden death of her only son.  In the ED  her blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  pulse rate 110/min  and respiratory rate 24/min. The ECG showed ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads (V2-V4). Initial cardiac enzyme tests indicated moderately elevated troponin levels.   The patient was initially managed as a suspected case of acute myocardial infarction and underwent emergency coronary angiography. The results showed no significant stenosis in coronary arteries. Thus  myocardial infarction was unlikely. However  her left ventriculography revealed apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesis  resembling a takotsubo.   The patient was managed conservatively with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and reassured regarding the generally good prognosis of the condition.  Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical presentation  cardiac biomarker levels  ECG changes  and characteristic angiographic findings  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC) or Broken Heart Syndrome was made.  Conclusion:   This case represents an instance of TTC associated with bereavement stress. It highlights the necessity of considering TTC in the differential diagnosis in patients  especially post-menopausal women  presenting with chest pain  ECG changes  and elevated cardiac markers despite angiographically normal coronary arteries. The underlying intense stress and emotional trauma appear to be potential triggering factors.   As TTC often mimics an acute myocardial infarction  an accurate and rapid diagnosis is critical to initiate the appropriate management and avoid unnecessary invasive treatments. Moreover  given the clear association between emotional stressors and TTC  clinicians should also consider the importance of psychological support as part of the management plan.
15,7,10,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial10,Patient Information: The patient  a 64-year-old Caucasian woman who lives alone  presented at the ER with acute onset of severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and light-headedness. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but no known cardiac history. Her regular medications include Amlodipine for her blood pressure and Atorvastatin for her cholesterol. She has been a non-smoker for her entire life  consumes alcohol infrequently  and maintains a balanced diet.   Situation Leading to Presentation: She reported that she had heard upsetting news that her only son was moving overseas in two days earlier. An initial electrocardiogram was concerning for an acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Her initial cardiac biomarkers showed a troponin level of 4.2 ng/mL (normal range <0.04 ng/mL) with a CK-MB of 35 ng/mL (normal range <7 ng/mL).  Investigations: The patient underwent emergency coronary angiography to rule out myocardial infarction. The angiogram showed normal coronary arteries without any significant stenosis. However  ventricular angiography showed left ventricular apical ballooning suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis: The diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was established based on the Mayo Clinic criteria: transient hypokinesis  akinesis  or dyskinesis of the left ventricular mid-segments with apical ballooning; absence of obstructive coronary disease or angiographic evidence of an acute plaque rupture; new ECG changes or elevated cardiac troponin level; and absence of pheochromocytoma or myocarditis.  Treatment: She was initially managed with aspirin  a loading dose of P2Y12 inhibitor (Clopidogrel)  beta-blocker (Metoprolol)  and ACE inhibitor (Lisinopril). Once coronary artery disease was excluded and the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was confirmed  aspirin and Clopidogrel were discontinued. She was maintained on Metoprolol and Lisinopril.  Outcome and Follow-Up: Her hospital course was uneventful  her signs and symptoms improved dramatically over the next 48 hours and she was discharged home. One month later at her cardiology outpatient follow-up  repeat echocardiography showed normalization of the left ventricular systolic function. The patient has since been coping well with ongoing psychological support to manage her emotional stress.  Learning Points: This case highlights the relationship between emotional stress and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Thorough medical evaluation is crucial in differential diagnosis to exclude acute coronary syndrome. The management of patients with this condition often involves handling not only their cardiac condition but also their psychological stressors.
15,7,11,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial11,"Title: Postmenopausal Woman with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Precipitated by Emotional Stress  Case Report:  Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year-old African American woman  who lives with her adult children in the suburban area. She is a widow  and a retired elementary school teacher. She has no history of alcohol or tobacco use.  Clinical Findings: The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  symptoms of palpitations  and shortness of breath. She reported an extremely stressful episode occurred earlier in the day  involving a sudden passing of a close friend.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: The EKG on presentation demonstrated ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads. Patient was immediately brought to the cardiac catheterization lab  thinking it was an acute myocardial infarction. However  coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease. Left ventriculography showed apical ballooning with hypercontraction of the basal segments  a classic """"octopus pot"""" appearance indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC).  Her laboratory profile showed increased values of cardiac enzymes with Troponin T level of 0.94 ng/ml. Echocardiogram revealed left ventricular systolic dysfunction  with a reduced ejection fraction of 40%. Her blood pressure was normal  and she had a heart rate of 88 beats per minute.   Past Medical History: The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus type 2  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension. She had also been treated a couple of years back for a major depressive disorder.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment: The patient was managed with standard heart failure medication including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. Her blood glucose was also managed with insulin therapy. A psychiatric team was involved to address her emotional stressors and past history of depressive disorder. A grief counseling session was also arranged to help cope with her loss.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Post-treatment  she showed significant improvement both physically and emotionally. The repeat echocardiogram after 8 weeks showed a normal ejection fraction and resolution of wall motion abnormalities  confirming the diagnosis of TTC. The patient was then discharged from the hospital with appointments for regular follow-ups and continued grief counseling sessions.  Conclusion: This case demonstrated that TTC  often precipitated by severe emotional stress  might present similarly as an acute coronary syndrome. Hence  it underscores the importance of the differential diagnosis in a patient presenting with chest pain and EKG changes  especially in postmenopausal women with an emotional trigger.

15,7,12,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial12,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Demographics: Patient Identifier: Mrs. A Age: 64 years old Gender: Female  Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher  Current Presentation: The patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath  which had started a couple of hours before her presentation. On examination  she appeared in distress with labored breathing. The chest pain was described as sharp and persistent  centralized in the mid chest region without radiation to the neck  jaw  or left arm.   Past Medical History:  The patient had a significant past medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  maintained on standard medication. She had no known allergies. She had no previously documented instances of angina  myocardial infarctions or cardiac interventions. Mrs. A had no history of diabetes mellitus  connective tissue disorders or malignancies. Her family history was significant for coronary artery disease  as her father had been diagnosed at the age of 59.   Investigations: On admission  her vital signs showed a blood pressure of 170/110 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per min  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per min and peripheral oxygen saturation of 92% on ambient air. The electrocardiogram revealed ST segment elevations in leads V1-V4 suggestive of an anterior wall STEMI. Blood tests revealed slightly elevated cardiac troponin levels. A bedside echocardiogram demonstrated apical ballooning with preserved basal function suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Treatment and Course: The patient was started on beta blockers  ACE inhibitors  and statins as per the standard treatment protocol for suspected acute coronary syndrome. She was also put on oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation over 94%. Given the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  high stress level was identified as a potential triggering factor  although the patient could not recall any particular recent stressing events. On the 3rd day of admission  the patient's condition improved significantly; her chest pain had subsided  and her respiratory status had stabilized. A repeat echocardiogram showed improvement in the apical ballooning. The patient was discharged after 5 days of hospital stay with prescriptions and lifestyle modification advice.  Follow Up: She was scheduled for a regular outpatient cardiology follow up visits. The importance of regular follow-ups and medication compliance were discussed in detail  with an emphasis on controlling hypertension and lowering cholesterol levels. The patient was also advised to seek therapeutic modalities to manage stress.  Conclusion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  can mimic the presentation of acute coronary syndrome. This case of Mrs. A highlighted the significance of comprehensive clinical examinations and the prudent use of diagnostic tools to establish the correct diagnosis and hence the appropriate management. 
15,7,13,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial13,Patient Description: A 62-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department.  Presenting Complaint: The patient was concerned about recent episodes of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that began after receiving news of her son's sudden passing.  Medical History: The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension  for which she has been on amlodipine 10 mg daily for the past ten years . She has no known allergies. She has a 20 pack-year history of smoking but quit 15 years ago. She does not consume alcohol or use illicit drugs. There is no family history of ischemic heart disease or any genetic disorders.   Assessment: Physical examination showed that her blood pressure was 170/95 mmHg  heart rate was 105 beats per minute  and respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. The patient appeared anxious and was sweating profusely. The cardiovascular examination revealed no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. The lungs were clear to auscultation  and the rest of her examination was normal.  Investigation: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exhibited ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. The Preliminary blood investigations showed normal complete blood count  electrolytes  renal  and liver function test results. Cardiac markers were elevated with troponin I level of 2.4 ng/ml.   Hospital Course: The patient was promptly moved to the Cath lab suspecting acute myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography showed no obstructive coronary artery disease. Left ventriculography revealed apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesis consistent with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   Management: The patient was started on therapy with a beta-blocker (metoprolol)  an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril)  and a statin (atorvastatin). The patient's chest pain and dyspnea improved significantly over the next few days. Repeat echocardiogram after 1 week showed significant improvement in left ventricular function.   Discussion:  Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is most commonly reported in postmenopausal women  it can occur in people of all ages and genders. Our patient's particular circumstance of her son's unexpected death was probably the acute emotional stressor that resulted in TCM.   Conclusion: This case illustrates the classic presentation of TCM following a severe emotional stressor. Despite the initial presentation's similarity with acute myocardial infarction  the lack of significant coronary artery disease  and characteristic ventriculogram contributed to the diagnosis of TCM. This case emphasizes the importance of considering TCM in the differential diagnosis when presented with similar cases. Also  it underlines the significance of stress management  considering TCM has been associated with emotional and physical stressors. 
15,7,14,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial14,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 60-year-old Female  Presenting Patient:  A 60-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset severe  crushing central chest pain that radiated to her left arm. The pain was not associated with exertion and came on suddenly while she was attending her husband's funeral service. The pain was accompanied by pallor  sweating and a brief episode of syncope.  Demographics:  The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian female  married and retired secondary school teacher  who lives with her daughter and son-in-law after her husband's recent passing away. She used to smoke  but quit 20 years ago and drinks alcohol occasionally. There is no record of drug abuse.  Past Medical History:  She has a history of well-controlled hypertension for the past 10 years and is on regular antihypertensive medication. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 5 years ago and maintains good control with oral hypoglycaemic agents. She also has a history of mild anxiety and has been on low doses of an SSRIs with good control of her symptoms. There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease.  Presenting Symptoms:  She is in severe pain rated at 8 on a 0-10 scale despite 5 mg of IV morphine. She has pallor  and her blood pressure is 105/65 mmHg  and heart rate is 110 bpm. She reports a feeling of impending doom.  Investigations:  Initial ECG shows ST-elevation in anterior leads  consistent with a suspected myocardial infarction. Troponin I level was elevated. However  a subsequent coronary angiogram revealed patent coronary arteries. An echocardiogram was performed that showed hypokinesia of the mid and apical segments of the left ventricle with hypercontraction of the basal walls  a pattern suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment and Outcome:  The diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was confirmed  and the patient was treated with supportive measures including ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics. Her pain gradually subsided over the course of several hours  and her cardiac function returned to normal upon re-testing 4 weeks later  confirming the diagnosis.  Discussion:  This case illustrates the typical clinical scenario of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  often precipitated by sudden emotional stress. Despite presenting like an acute myocardial infarction  coronary angiography often reveals patent coronary arteries  while shell ventriculography or echocardiography demonstrates the characteristic balloon-like dilation of the apical segments of the left ventricle. Management is usually supportive  and most patients experience complete resolution of symptoms within weeks.
15,7,15,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial15,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman: A Case Study   Case Presentation:   The patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia and pre-diabetes. She presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm. She is a retired school teacher  lives with her husband  non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. Her family history reveals that her mother had cardiovascular disease and her father had Type-2 diabetes.   Clinical Findings:  Upon arrival at the hospital  she appeared distressed and diaphoretic. Her blood pressure was 165/95 mmHg  pulse rate was 100 bpm  respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation was 96% on room air and her body temperature was within the normal range. Cardiac auscultation revealed no murmur  gallop or rub. Pulmonary  abdominal  and neurological examinations were normal. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads and mild T-wave inversions in the inferior leads.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Given the suspicion of an acute coronary syndrome  she was immediately started on dual antiplatelet therapy  beta-blockers  and high-intensity statin. Troponin I level was elevated at 2.8 ng/mL. However  a coronary angiogram did not show any significant coronary artery disease. A left ventriculogram revealed apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesis consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient did not have any evident stressors except she mentioned having a heated argument with her husband the day before the symptoms occurred.  Therapeutic Intervention & Follow-Up:  In consultation with Cardiology  the patient was managed conservatively with continuation of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The dual antiplatelet therapy and statin were discontinued. She was monitored in the cardiac care unit and her chest pain improved over the next couple of days. Echocardiogram prior to discharge showed improving left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 45% (initially it was 30%). The patient was discharged home with instructions to avoid stress and to follow-up in the outpatient cardiology clinic.  Conclusion:  This case highlights that takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome """" should be considered as a differential diagnosis among post-menopausal women presenting with chest pain and EKG changes suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome  especially in the absence of significant coronary artery disease. This case also emphasizes the essential role of a thorough patient history to understand potential emotional triggers  which could be valuable in the management of this condition."

Emergency coronary angiography was performed  showing normal coronary arteries without any signs of atherosclerosis. Left ventriculography showed apical ballooning with preserved basal function  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Cardiac biomarkers were significantly elevated with troponin T levels peaking at 332 ng/L (reference range  <14 ng/L) about 14 hours after the onset of symptoms. Echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular systolic dysfunction  with a left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 45%.  The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) where she received treatment that included beta blockers  ACE inhibitors and diuretics. As she stabilized  her blood pressure levels returned to her baseline and her chest pain subsided completely. The patient was discharged on the fifth day with medical therapy including metoprolol  lisinopril  and aspirin. She was also recommended to follow up with her primary care physician and a cardiologist as an outpatient  and she was advised to join a support group or start therapy to address the emotional trauma she experienced.  A follow-up exam performed 3 months later showed complete recovery of left ventricular function as confirmed by echocardiography  which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 60%. This helped confirm the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  as the spontaneous recovery is characteristic of this stress-induced condition.  Discussion: This case illustrates the clinical manifestation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy induced by emotional stress in a post-menopausal woman. This patient's presentation of symptoms typical of myocardial infarction  absence of obstructive coronary artery disease  and the presence of transient left ventricular dysfunction supports the diagnosis. The significant impact of emotional stress underlines the importance of the mind-heart connection and emphasizes the need for holistic patient management strategies in such cases  including psychological support."
15,7,17,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial17,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Triggered by Emotional Stress: A Case Report   Introduction:   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also referred to as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is a fully reversible form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy caused by excessive stress leading to an apical ballooning syndrome and deep T-wave inversions or QT segment prolongation on EKG. The condition  predominantly affecting postmenopausal women  is often precipitated by a significant stress event.   Case Presentation:   Patient Information: A 68-year-old Caucasian female  known to live alone  presented to the emergency room (ER) with chest discomfort radiating to her left arm along with shortness of breath.  Medical History: Her past medical history included hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which were well controlled with medication. She had no known cardiac history. Family history revealed a mother with hypertension but no premature coronary disease or sudden cardiac death.  Clinical Findings: On examination  she was noticed to be tachycardic with a heart rate of 105 bpm  blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg. Her physical examination was largely unremarkable  with no clinical evidence of heart failure. Normal S1 and S2 were heard and there were no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  Diagnostic Assessment: Electrocardiography revealed T wave inversions in the anterior precordial leads  initially raising concerns for ischemic heart disease. An echo-cardiogram showed reduced left ventricular systolic function with apical ballooning  consistent with the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her troponin T level was mildly raised at 0.06 ng/ml (normal = < 0.01 ng/ml). Subsequent cardiac catheterisation ruled out a coronary artery disease  further confirming the suspected diagnosis.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit and started on beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and was treated conservatively with aspirin and statins until coronary artery disease was ruled out.  Follow-up and Outcomes: A follow-up echo-cardiogram after two weeks showed complete resolution of apical ballooning with an improved left ventricular ejection fraction  thus confirming the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She reported the recent stress of her grandson's sudden death  suggesting an emotional trigger for her cardio-vascular event.  Patient Perspective: The patient stated she felt """"relieved"""" that she did not have a heart attack  but was surprised that """"stress could have such an impact"""" on her heart. She is committed to managing her stress levels and continuing the prescribed medication considering her cardiac episode.  Conclusion:   This clinical presentation highlights the important differential of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in post-menopausal women presenting with symptoms suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. It underscores the need for thorough investigation  to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. It is essential to consider emotional stress as a trigger for a broken heart syndrome."
15,7,18,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial18,"Patient Information:  A 67-year-old Hispanic female patient presented to the emergency department of a community hospital.  Chief Complaint:  The patient complained of severe chest pain that started about an hour prior to presentation while she was dealing with a stressful situation at home.  Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of hypertension for which she has been taking prescribed alpha-beta blockers for about five years. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes six years ago and has been controlling it with dietary modification and oral medications. She denied smoking or alcohol use but reported a moderate level of daily stress mainly related to her role as caregiver for her husband who has Parkinson's disease.  Description of Problem:  The patient was in severe distress during presentation  with symptoms mimicking that of a classic heart attack  including shortness of breath  palpitations  and chest pain - primarily on the left side. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation  initially suggestive of a myocardial infarction  prompting urgent attention.   However  an emergency cardiac catheterization showed no significant blockages in the coronary arteries that would cause a heart attack. An echocardiogram and left ventriculogram showed a normal size left ventricle  severely reduced function  and a peculiar shape - her left ventricle took on the appearance of a traditional Japanese octopus fishing pot  known as """"takotsubo"""". Given the patient’s symptoms  absence of significant coronary blockages and the characteristic abnormality demonstrated  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment and Outcome:  Treatment was initiated which comprised mainly supportive care since there is no clear consensus on how to treat Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. As her chest pain began to subside  her cardiac function gradually returned to normal over the course of a few weeks. The unusual shape of the left ventricle slowly disappeared  confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her at-home supportive care was recommended to reduce stress levels.  Conclusion:  This case highlights that the presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can closely mimic more renowned cardiac disorders such as myocardial infarction  hence its nickname """"Broken Heart Syndrome"""". High stress levels  in this case life strain associated with caregiving  appear to play a key role. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possibility of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  especially in post-menopausal women with a recent history of severe emotional stress. "
15,7,19,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial19,Title: Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Triggered by Emotional Stress  Patient Profile:  Mr. X is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  a retired professional  with no known history of any cardiovascular diseases. His past medical history is significant for controlled type II Diabetes Mellitus for the past seven years  managed with Metformin and lifestyle modifications. He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol rarely. He has no known allergies.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. X presented to our emergency department with acute onset of severe chest pain  radiating to the left arm  shortly after he received the news of his elder brother's sudden death. He also reported feeling lightheaded and experiencing difficulty in breathing on the way to the hospital.   Physical Examination:  On admission  his vitals were unstable with blood pressure recordings at 170/105 mmHg and heart rate at 110 bpm. Physical examination revealed an anxious-looking patient in distress  with cold  clammy skin. Cardiac examination revealed S3 gallop rhythm with no audible murmurs. His respiratory rate was 22 per minute with clear lung fields  and his oxygen saturation was maintained at 96% on room air.  Investigations:  Blood tests showed elevated cardiac biomarkers  with troponin I level at 2.0 ng/ml (Normal: <0.01 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads suggestive of anterior wall myocardial infarction.   However  an emergency coronary angiogram did not reveal any significant coronary artery disease to explain the ECG changes. A subsequent echocardiogram and left ventriculography  however  demonstrated apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal walls and severely impaired apical contractility  findings suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Diagnosis:  Given these findings  a diagnosis of stress-induced (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy was made.  Treatment & Follow-up:  The patient was immediately started on standard heart failure regime  which included beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics to manage his symptoms. Anxiolytics were also given  considering the nature of the event triggering this episode. The patient responded well to the treatment  and his symptoms showed rapid improvement.  By the end of the first week  a repeat echocardiogram showed significant improvement in the left ventricular function  with the resolution of apical ballooning. He was discharged after two weeks with plans for follow-up and long-term prescription of heart failure medications  with a strict advice to avoid stress and receive regular psychological counseling.  Discussion:  The present case is a classic example of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy which is often triggered by severe stress. The importance of recognizing this condition lies in the fact that it mimics acute coronary syndrome (ACS)  and a correct diagnosis can prevent unnecessary invasive procedures in these patients.

Wilson presented herself to the emergency department citing severe chest pain with radiating discomfort through her left arm. She reported the symptoms resembling a """"heart attack"""" experience.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a previously diagnosed Type-2 diabetes for past 6 years  controlled with oral hypoglycemic medications. She is hypertensive  under treatment for the last decade. She has a history of hyperlipidemia and peripheral vascular disease. However  the patient doesn't have any prior history of coronary artery disease or any other heart ailments. She has been a non-smoker and abstains from alcohol.  Clinical Findings:  On an initial examination  Mrs. Wilson was visibly distressed and perspiring profusely. Her blood pressure recorded was 145/90 mmHg  heart rate was 110 bpm  and respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.  Investigations:  An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads  suggesting an acute myocardial infarction. A blood test revealed elevated cardiac enzymes  including troponin T. An emergency coronary angiogram  usually done to visualize blockages in the coronary arteries in suspected heart attack cases  didn't show any significant obstructions. A subsequent left ventriculogram demonstrated a decreased ejection fraction with regional wall motion abnormalities comprising apical akinesia and basal hyperkinesis  resembling the shape of 'takotsubo' or an octopus pot.   Diagnosis:  Based on the clinical manifestations  ECG changes  elevated cardiac biomarkers  absence of significant coronary artery disease on angiography  and characteristic findings on ventriculogram  the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM) was established.  Therapeutic Intervention:  As there's no definitive treatment for TCM   her management was supportive. She was treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and aspirin.   Follow-up and Outcomes:  On the follow-up appointment after 3 months  a repeat echocardiogram showed complete resolution of the initial wall motion abnormalities with normalized ejection fraction. Mrs. Wilson reported feeling considerably improved and her chest pain had ceased.  Patient Perspective:  The sudden and severe onset of symptoms had alarmed Mrs. Wilson. However  after the successful treatment and complete recovery  she was relieved and grateful. She continues to manage her hypertension and diabetes and follows a healthy lifestyle more scrupulously.  Informed Consent:  Written informed consent was taken from Mrs. Wilson for publishing this case.  Learning Points:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  commonly known as """"broken heart syndrome """" can mimic the symptoms of a heart attack and can be triggered by intense emotional stress.

15,7,21,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial21,"Title: An Unusual Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in an Elderly Female Patient  Abstract:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  commonly known as stress-induced (or """"broken heart"""") syndrome  is often triggered by physical or emotional stressors and typically mimics symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. This case study presents an unusual manifestation of TTC in a 77-year-old female  previously undiagnosed  emphasizing the diversity of this condition’s presentation.  Case Presentation:  A 77-year-old Caucasian woman  was brought to the emergency department with a 2-day history of worsening shortness of breath  unexplained fatigue  and intermittent chest discomfort. She was a retired teacher  divorced  with two children. She did not smoke  drink alcohol  or use recreational drugs but reported chronic anxiety and depression managed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Past medical history revealed an under-active thyroid (managed with levothyroxine) and osteoporosis. There was no known history of coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular disorders in her immediate family.  Clinical examination showed sinus tachycardia with no murmurs  gallops  or rubs on cardiac auscultation. Her blood pressure was 155/90 mmHg on presentation. Blood tests showed elevated troponin levels (indicative of cardiac injury). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed non-specific ST elevations  and echocardiography showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle typical of TTC  with preserved basal function and moderately reduced ejection fraction (40%).  Upon further questioning  the patient revealed that she had recently gone through a prolonged period of stress and anxiety due to the sudden death of her close friend. Given her clinical presentation and the absence of coronary artery occlusion confirmed by coronary angiography  a diagnosis of TTC was made.  This patient was treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  aspirin  and diuretics for heart failure. Her symptoms improved significantly over her ten-day hospital stay. Close outpatient follow-up over six months showed complete resolution of ventricular function.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of considering TTC as a differential diagnosis in elderly female patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome-like symptoms  particularly in those with a recent history of significant emotional stress. Despite its """"benign"""" reputation  TTC can present severely and may require intensive management. Regular follow-up is necessary to ensure the complete recovery of cardiac function."
15,7,22,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial22,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following Emotional Distress: A Case Report  Abstract: We present a case of a 55-year-old female presenting with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) after a severe emotional stressor  mimicking an acute myocardial infarction.   Case Presentation: The patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian female  current non-smoker with a past medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  well managed with diet and medication. Her family history was negative for cardiac diseases. She works as a high school teacher and lives with her husband and two children. She was brought into the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset chest pain  heaviness  and shortness of breath.  The symptoms occurred after she received news of her brother's sudden death. She described the pain as severe  9/10  discomfort localized at the center of her chest radiating towards her left arm. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed T-wave inversions and QT prolongation without any ST-segment elevations. Her troponin levels were elevated at admission but her creatine kinase-MB levels were within the normal range. There were no significant changes in her complete blood count  serum electrolytes  liver function tests  and renal function tests.   She underwent emergency coronary angiography  which revealed negligible coronary artery disease. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated apical ballooning of the left ventricle  suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed reduced ejection fraction and apical hypokinesis  consistent with a diagnosis of TC.  She was admitted to the cardiac care unit for close hemodynamic monitoring. The patient was started on treatment with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and aspirin per the standard of care. After a week  she was discharged and advised for regular cardiovascular rehabilitation. The patient was also referred to a psychologist for stress management and counseling to mitigate her emotional distress.  Discussion:  This case underscores the presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of extreme emotional distress  highlighting the importance of recognizing the clinical scenario in a high-stress context. The patient exhibited typical signs and symptoms of TC  and imaging techniques confirmed the diagnosis. She responded well to conventional heart failure treatment and psychological support  demonstrating the importance of multidimensional care in patients diagnosed with TC.  Conclusion: Healthcare professionals should consider Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain after an emotional stressor  despite a paucity of atherosclerotic disease. 
15,7,23,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial23,Case Report: A 67-Year-Old Female with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Demographics  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female who resides in a small rural town in the Pacific Northwest. She is a widow and lives independently. She is retired from an administrative job in a local high school and maintains an active life  participating in community events and volunteering at a soup kitchen. The patient is a former smoker  having quit 15 years prior  and consumes alcohol moderately. She has no known drug allergies.  Past Medical History  The patient has a history of hypertension and has been successfully treated with Losartan  a medication she has been on for 10 years. Her blood pressure has been well-controlled  with readings typically in the 120s/70s. She has no history of diabetes  dyslipidemia  or heart disease. She was diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder approximately five years ago  which has been managed through light therapy and regular counseling sessions. She has no history of surgeries or hospitalizations.  Presenting Symptoms and Diagnosis  The patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset of chest pain  radiating to her left arm and jaw  and shortness of breath. The symptoms began suddenly following a phone call she received informing her of her sister’s unexpected death. She also reported feelings of intense emotional distress.   Physical examination showed elevated blood pressure and pulse. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads. However  coronary angiography did not show significant atherosclerotic lesions. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed hypokinesis of the apical and mid segments of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal segments  a finding known as apical ballooning  consistent with the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Troponin T levels were elevated  but natriuretic peptides were normal.   Treatment and Follow-up  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) for closer monitoring. She was started on beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and anxiolytics. By day 3  her symptoms had substantially improved. A following-up echocardiogram after 10 weeks showed complete resolution of the regional wall motion abnormalities  and the left ventricular ejection fraction had returned to normal.   Further psychological counseling was recommended  as extreme emotional stress seemed to trigger her episode of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Regular daily activities were gradually reintroduced  and her cardiologist is closely monitoring her condition to prevent any future cardiac events. The patient and her family have been provided with education and resources regarding takotsubo cardiomyopathy  mental health  and stress management.
15,7,24,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial24,Title: A Case Report on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Female  Introduction: We report the case of a 65-year-old female  presenting with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  a condition characterized by transient myocardial dysfunction and electrocardiographic abnormalities that mimic acute myocardial infarction.  Case Presentation: The patient  a Caucasian postmenopausal woman with a distinctive past medical history of hypertension and depression  visited the emergency department complaining of chest pain radiating to the arm and jaw that started an hour prior to arriving. She denied any tobacco or alcohol use but reported significant emotional stress due to the recent loss of her husband.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed the patient was diaphoretic  in moderate distress with a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  pulse rate of 90 bpm  and respiration rate of 20 breaths per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Breath sounds were normal. A 12-lead EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads and troponin I level was elevated. Together with her symptoms  these results indicated acute coronary syndrome (ACS).  Diagnostic Assessment: However  on coronary angiography  there was no evidence of significant obstructive atherosclerosis that would be indicative of an acute myocardial infarction. The ventriculogram showed apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basal segments  consistent with TTC or 'broken heart syndrome.'  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was treated supportively with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and aspirin. She was also provided with low-dose benzodiazepine for her anxiety and grief. There was a significant improvement in her symptoms and echocardiography revealed normalization of her left ventricular function within six weeks.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Being a unique cardiovascular response to intense emotional stress  psychological support is required in most TTC patients. After 6 months of follow-up  the patient remained asymptomatic with normal left ventricular function.  Patient Perspective: The patient recognized her symptoms to be reflective of emotional strain following her husband's sudden demise  which was a cathartic realization for her. She was grateful for the medical intervention and psychological support  which she felt improved her quality of life.  Conclusions: This case highlights the importance of considering TTC in the differential diagnosis of ACS  especially in postmenopausal women undergoing significant emotional stress. It emphasizes that the management of this condition must be two-pronged - addressing both cardiac function and psychological wellbeing.+ 
15,7,25,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial25,Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following a Severe Emotional Trauma   Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a transient left ventricular dysfunction typically triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. Herein  we report a case of a female patient who developed TCM subsequent to a major emotional trauma.  Case Presentation: The patient  Ms. T  is a 63-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of hypertension  for which she is on treatment with hydrochlorothiazide 25mg once daily  and type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with oral metformin. She lives alone and reports being a non-smoker and abstaining from alcohol.   Ms. T presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of severe chest pain radiating to both arms  associated with dyspnea and palpitations  beginning shortly after learning about the sudden death of her only son in a tragic car accident the same day. She denied any similar previous incident or family history of premature cardiovascular disease.  On physical examination  she was distressed  with a blood pressure of 150/95 mmHg and heart rate of 110 bpm. Her cardiovascular examination was unremarkable except for tachycardia without any murmurs  rubs or gallops. Her respiratory  abdominal  and neurological examinations were within normal limits.  In the ED  her initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  and her initial blood tests showed elevated troponin levels. She was immediately treated for suspected myocardial infarction with aspirin  clopidogrel  and sublingual nitroglycerin  but her chest pain persisted. Coronary angiography did not demonstrate significant coronary artery disease.  Subsequent echocardiography revealed akinesia of the apical segments and hyperkinesia of the basal segments of the left ventricle  a feature known as 'apical ballooning'  highly suggestive of TCM. Ms. T was therefore diagnosed with TCM based on the Mayo Clinic criteria.  Ms. T was admitted to the coronary care unit. Her chest pain resolved within 48 hours  and her heart rate and blood pressure were controlled with a beta-blocker (metoprolol). Her emotional state was addressed by the psychiatric team  who started her on supportive psychotherapy and an SSRI (Escitalopram) for her underlying acute stress reaction. By day 7  her left ventricular function had significantly improved  as seen in a repeat echocardiogram.  Discussion: This case illustrates the importance of considering TCM in the differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome  especially in postmenopausal women experiencing intense emotional stress. Ensuring optimal management for these patients requires both medical and psychiatric intervention for optimal recovery and prevention of recurrence.  Conclusion: TCM is a rare but serious consequence of acute intense emotional stress. A comprehensive approach including psychotherapy and pharmacological intervention is vital for patient recovery.

Her past medical history is only significant for well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She has no history of smoking  alcohol abuse  or drug abuse. Her BMI is 27  and she leads an active lifestyle that includes regular exercise.  Clinical Presentation:  Two days prior to the onset of her symptoms  the patient had been discharged following an elective knee replacement surgery with no immediate post-operative complications. The patient’s chest pain began suddenly at home  four hours post-discharge  and it was described as a pressure-like sensation - """"like an elephant standing on my chest"""".  Investigations: Electrocardiography (ECG) in the emergency department revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads and an absence of Q waves. Troponin levels were elevated at 3.60 ng/mL. Follow-up ECGs showed progressive resolution of the ST elevations and T wave inversions. Transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesis  consistent with the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Outcome:  The patient's condition was managed with supportive care  including diuretics  ACE inhibitors  and beta-blockers. The patient's symptoms substantially improved over the next week  and follow-up echocardiography performed 3 weeks later showed complete resolution of the wall motion abnormalities.  Discussion:  The pathophysiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy remains unclear  but it has been hypothesized that it may be related to transient coronary vasospasm or catecholamine-mediated myocardial stunning due to emotional or physical stress. In this case  the stress of surgery may have precipitated the condition. This case is a reminder that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can mimic the clinical and ECG findings of an acute coronary syndrome  and must be considered in differential diagnoses  especially in postmenopausal women with new onset chest pain following a recent period of intense stress.  Conclusion: In in this case  the patient with no significant past cardiac history developed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy after non-cardiac surgery indicating that this condition should be considered as a differential diagnosis for patients presenting with acute chest pain following a stressful event  even when the event is not emotionally stressful. Furthermore  this underlines the need for further investigation of the unknown pathophysiology of this condition and its better management."
15,7,27,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial27,Case Report:  Title: Transient Apical Ballooning Syndrome: A Case Study on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  1. Patient Information: A 76-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency department with severe left-sided chest pain radiating to the back and associated with shortness of breath. The patient further reported intermittent episodes of nausea and vomiting. She had no history of smoking or alcoholism.  2. Background:  Medical History: The patient was previously diagnosed with hypertension  for which she was prescribed Lisinopril 10 mg daily. She had no history of cardiac diseases. She had been managing well with her son at home until recently when she had several life stressors including the death of her younger brother.  Allergies: The patient reported no known allergies.  Medications: In addition to Lisinopril for hypertension  she was taking a multivitamin supplement.  3. Investigation:  Lab findings: The lab results showed a slightly elevated troponin level at 0.11 ng/mL (normal range: 0-0.04 ng/mL)  while the initial EKG demonstrated ST-segment elevation in leads II  III  and aVF. Other blood tests including complete blood count  liver and kidney function tests were normal.  Medical imaging: A subsequent echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal walls  a typical picture of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiogram was normal.  4. Clinical Course:   The patient was managed conservatively with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The ST-segment elevations resolved within 24 hours after admission and her symptoms significantly improved over the next few days.  5. Follow Up/Outcome:  Follow-up echocardiogram  carried out after 8 weeks  showed complete resolution of the left ventricular dysfunction. The patient’s cardiac function has completely returned to normal.  6. Conclusion:  The patient's presenting symptoms  paired with the characteristic echocardiographic findings and the absence of significant coronary artery disease upon angiography  support the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the context of emotional stress. This case demonstrates the important role of echocardiography and coronary angiography in the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The case also serves as a reminder that not all sudden chest pain in patients with risk factors for heart disease is due to obstructive coronary artery disease  and that other stress-related diagnoses such as takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be considered. 
15,7,28,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial28,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 74-year-old woman: Case report  Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is a temporary heart condition often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress.   Case Presentation: A 74-year-old African American woman was presented to the emergency room with an onset of chest pain  dyspnea  and light-headedness following an incident of emotional distress related to the death of her son. She was a recent widower with two surviving adult children.  She was living independently and was very active in her community. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension and osteoarthritis. She reported having quit smoking about twenty years ago and consumed alcohol in moderation. She had no previous history of cardiac disease and her family history revealed a father who had suffered a stroke at the age of 65.  On examination  she appeared anxious and was in moderate distress due to chest pain. Her blood pressure was 152/90mm Hg  heart rate 110 bpm  respiratory rate 24/min and oxygen saturation 94% on room air.  Blood tests showed elevated troponin I levels at 2.7 ng/ml (normal: <0.06 ng/ml) suggestive of myocardial injury. An electrocardiogram revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyper-contractile basal segments  classic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  The patient was immediately treated with supportive care consisting of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Coronary angiography was performed which showed normal coronary arteries.  Discussion: This patient was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition often related to acute emotional or physical stress. Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear  it is widely believed that a sudden surge in stress hormones (like adrenaline) leads to changes in the heart muscle that prevent the left ventricle from contracting effectively.   This case illustrates the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of older patients presenting with chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes  especially in the context of recent emotional stress. Prompt recognition and supportive treatment can lead to excellent prognosis with most patients experiencing complete recovery within weeks.  Conclusion: This case reiterates the crucial role of sudden emotional stress in precipitating takotsubo cardiomyopathy  especially in post-menopausal women. It highlights the importance of comprehensive clinical assessment and offers insights into the urgent need for specific preventive and management strategies targeting stress-induced cardiomyopathy for at-risk individuals.

Past Medical History:  Mrs. Jones is a relatively healthy elderly woman with no documented prior cardiovascular disease. She is a former smoker and quit 20 years ago. She has been diagnosed with hypertension for the last 10 years controlled with antihypertensive drugs. She also takes medications for osteoporosis and has a history of major depressive disorder managed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI).  Current Medication:  - Lisinopril (for Hypertension) - Alendronate Sodium (for Osteoporosis) - Fluoxetine (for Depression)  Physical Examination:  On admission  Mrs. Jones appeared anxious. Her vital signs were: BP 160/90 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats/minute  respiratory rate 25 breaths/minute and temperature 37.2°C. Her breathing sounds were normal  cardiac auscultation revealed tachycardia with no murmurs  and her extremities were warm without edema.  Diagnostics:  Her initial EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads (V1-V3). Cardiac enzymes (Troponin I) were elevated. The chest X-Ray was unremarkable. Given her presentation  she was initially diagnosed with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and was taken for an urgent coronary angiogram.  However  the angiogram showed no coronary artery disease that could account for a pronounced myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram performed afterwards showed hypokinesis of the mid and apical segments of the left ventricular myocardium and hyperkinesis of the basal walls  typical findings for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""". The tests also revealed slightly increased left ventricular wall thickness and mild mitral regurgitation.  Case Management:  She was treated conservatively with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  diuretics and beta-blockers. She also received psychological support following her husband's death.  Outcome: Her chest pain and shortness of breath gradually improved  and she was discharged 10 days later in stable condition with follow-up appointments with a cardiologist and a psychologist for ongoing management. An echocardiogram performed 2 months later showed complete normalization of her left ventricular function.  Conclusion:  This case reveals the importance of considering Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in postmenopausal women who present with chest pain following significant emotional stress. This condition  although similar to a heart attack  is typically reversible with proper management and supportive care."
15,7,30,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial30,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Mimicking Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Case Report   Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Patient Information:   Mrs. X is a 68-year-old Caucasian female from rural areas  who presented to the emergency room complaining of sudden onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She is a nonsmoker  consume alcohol occasionally  has a body mass index of 28kg/m2  and does not have any known allergies.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and had a cholecystectomy 15 years ago. She has been treated with a beta-blocker (Metoprolol)  thiazide diuretic (Hydrochlorothiazide) and statin (Atorvastatin). She has no history of illicit drug use  and her family history includes coronary artery disease in her father who died of myocardial infarction at the age of 60. Mrs. X has been recently experiencing stress and emotional turmoil due to the death of her husband three weeks prior.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  she was in obvious distress with a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  heart rate 101 beats per min  and respiratory rate 22 breaths/min. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm without murmurs. Other system examinations were within normal limits. Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads suggesting an acute anterolateral wall ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Laboratory findings showed elevated cardiac troponin I levels and mild leukocytosis.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  She was promptly treated as a case of acute STEMI with dual antiplatelet therapy  statins  and anticoagulation initiated. She underwent urgent coronary angiography which revealed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease. Left ventriculogram revealed apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesia typical of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   Management of Condition:  Her medications were adjusted accordingly  with continuation of her previously prescribed Metoprolol and Atorvastatin  and the addition of aspirin and Clopidogrel as per the protocol management for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics were added for symptomatic relief and cardiac remodeling. Counselling for stress reduction techniques and a referral for grief therapy were also made.  Outcome and Follow-up:  Within 48 hours  her symptoms improved markedly. Mrs. X was discharged home after five days with scheduled follow-up appointments for cardiac rehabilitation. Review after one-month showed significant improvement of her symptoms  and echocardiography confirmed recovery of left ventricular function.  Conclusion:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'  often mimics acute coronary syndrome. It is often linked with sudden emotional stress and has a good prognosis if diagnosed timely and managed appropriately. This case highlights the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in postmenopausal women presenting with acute chest pain  especially in the setting of recent significant emotional stress.

She lives with her husband and recently retired from her job as a public school teacher. She identifies as a non-smoker and consumer of alcohol on social occasions. Her BMI is 24.8 kg/m2  indicating a healthy weight range. She has no known drug allergies.   Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension  controlled with medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily)  and occasional migraines. She had never experienced any cardiac problems in the past. Her family history is notable for ischemic heart disease in her father  who died of myocardial infarction at the age of 68.  Current Clinical Findings:  The patient reported that her symptoms started approximately two hours prior to presentation  describing it as a sharp  substernal chest pain radiating to her left arm. She rated her pain as 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. She also noted the presence of profuse sweating  palpitations  and a sense of impending doom.   Diagnosis:  Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads  which prompted an urgent diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However  subsequent coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries. Meanwhile  left ventricular angiography showed apical ballooning with basilar hypercontractility  a typical finding known as """"takotsubo pattern"""". Echocardiography confirmed these findings. Her serum troponin-T level was slightly elevated (0.56 ng/mL; normal <0.01 ng/mL) with a normal creatinine kinase-MB fraction. Given these findings  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made.  Management and Follow-Up:  The patient was admitted to the cardiology ward and treated with aspirin  statin  and a low-dose beta-blocker (metoprolol). Benzodiazepines (diazepam) were prescribed to manage her anxiety. Her chest pain resolved over the next 48 hours.  On follow-up at three weeks  her symptoms had completely resolved. Follow-up echocardiography demonstrated normalization of left ventricular function and geometry. She was continued on her hypertension medications and advised to attend cardiac rehabilitation program to ensure the optimal recovery.  Conclusion:  This case of a 62-year-old female presents a typical takotsubo cardiomyopathy  precipitated by emotional stress  reinforcing the importance of considering this diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with acute chest pain  especially in the context of major stress.  This report contributes to the literature by detailing the successful management of takotsubo cardiomyopathy using combined pharmacological (beta-blockers  aspirin  and benzodiazepine) and behavioral (cardiac rehabilitation program) therapy. It also emphasises the importance of differentiating takotsubo cardiomyopathy from acute coronary syndrome in females with normal coronary arteries."
15,7,32,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial32,Title: Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman with No Medical History of Cardiovascular Disease  Patient Profile: Mrs. X is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  married  non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She is retired  and lives with her husband in the urban Midwest. Her BMI falls within the normal range (22.5 kg/m2)  and she is generally active  with regular mild to moderate exercise in her daily routine.  Past Medical History: Mrs. X has a history of hypertension  controlled through a daily regimen of 10mg Lisinopril. No previous diagnoses or symptoms of cardiovascular disease  no diabetes  no hyperlipidemia  and no history of stroke or any neurological diseases. She is postmenopausal  with no hormone replacement therapy. Her father had a late-onset myocardial infarction when he was in his 80s.  Current Presentation: Mrs. X presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute mid-sternal chest pain  radiating into both arms  which initiated after she received devastating news about a close family member's sudden death. Accompanying symptoms included diaphoresis  mild dyspnea and feeling of impending doom. There were no reported instances of nausea  vomiting or fainting.   Case Examination and Diagnosis: At the emergency department  patient was tachycardic (heart rate: 110 per minute) with a blood pressure: 140/90 mm Hg. The electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation in anterior leads and Troponin-I levels were elevated (3.5 ng/ml  normal <0.4).   Coronary angiography showed nonobstructive coronary disease. However  the left ventriculography displayed significant apical ballooning and contractile dysfunction of the mid and apical segments of the left ventricle with relatively preserved function of the base  a pattern typical of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM).  This coupled with her current emotional state led to the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also called stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome.  Treatment and Follow-up: Mrs. X was admitted to the cardiac care unit and treated presumptively for acute coronary syndrome. Her symptoms improved significantly with analgesics and anxiolytics. She remained hemodynamically stable and subsequent ECGs showed resolution of the ST-segment elevation after 48 hours. A follow-up echocardiogram after four weeks demonstrated normalized left ventricular function without apical ballooning.  The patient was subsequently counseled about the condition she experienced and potential triggers. She was encouraged to seek early intervention in case of future instances of extreme emotional stress and prescribed beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of considering TCM in the differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with symptoms mimicking acute coronary syndrome  particularly in the context of a recent emotional stressor. Also  it emphasizes the significance of a comprehensive and empathetic approach to patient care in managing cases like these.

The patient resides in a suburban area with her husband  is retired from a teaching job  and is a non-smoker with no history of alcohol abuse or substance misuse.  Past Medical History:  The patient reported no significant or known medical history. She did not have a previous history of cardiac disease  hypertension  diabetes  or any familial heart diseases. She had not undergone any major surgeries. She was not on any routine medications and had no known drug allergies.  History of Present Illness:  The symptoms started while she was having an intense argument with her neighbor. She described her symptoms as squeezing chest pain  associated with shortness of breath. The pain was gradual in onset  moderate in severity  and had persisted for a couple of hours before presentation. There was no associated fever  syncope  or palpitations.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  the patient appeared diaphoretic and in distress due to pain. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg  pulse 110 beats per minute  regular rhythm  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and a temperature of 98.4°F. Her heart and lung sounds were normal; she did not have peripheral edema or jugular venous distention.  Clinical Course:  Her ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. Biochemical markers (Troponin I) were elevated (2.0 ng/mL  norm: 0–0.04 ng/mL). Echocardiography revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesia of the base  a pattern consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM). Coronary angiogram did not show any significant coronary artery disease to explain the wall motion abnormalities.  Treatment Included:  Management included beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and anticoagulation (aspirin and heparin). The patient was shifted to ICU for further monitoring. Over the course of several days  the patient's condition and symptoms improved markedly. Repeat ECHO showed a resolution of apical ballooning with an improvement in ejection fraction.  Outcome:  The patient was discharged after 7 days of hospitalization. She was counseled about avoiding emotional stressors  regular checkups and strict adherence to medications. She was scheduled to follow up in the cardiology outpatient clinic.  Summary:  This case highlights an unusual instance of TCM precipitated by acute emotional stress  demonstrating its relevance and importance in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain. In the absence of significant coronary artery disease in a post-menopausal woman  TCM  commonly referred to as “broken heart syndrome """" should be considered."
15,7,34,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial34,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 54-Year-Old Female  Patient Profile The patient is a 54-year-old Caucasian female (N.S). She is a single mother of two teenage sons and works as a high school teacher in a busy metropolitan district. She is a non-smoker  drinks alcohol socially and does not report any illicit drug use. She has no history of heart disease or mental health disorders in the family.   Medical history The patient's past medical history is significant for hypothyroidism  for which she is taking levothyroxine sodium  and she had a hysterectomy one year prior due to uterine fibroids. She does not have any history of a heart condition  diabetes  or high blood pressure. No allergies were reported and the patient was up to date on her regular immunizations.  Presenting Symptoms N.S presented at the emergency department with acute and severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath  sweating  and palpitations. The pain had started suddenly while she was at her son's football game and did not relieve with rest. She also felt a sense of impending doom. No history of fever  cough  or syncope was reported  Diagnosis and Results The initial physical examination revealed tachycardia  hypotension  and tachypnea. Her ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  suggesting acute myocardial infarction. However  her troponin T levels were slightly above normal which suggested a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. A coronary angiogram was performed immediately  which showed normal coronary arteries. An echocardiogram revealed an akinesia of the apical segment of the left ventricle with preserved systolic function in the basal segments – a feature suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   Discussion Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy  is characterized by transient regional systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle  mimicking myocardial infarction but in the absence of angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture. The condition is often preceded by intense emotional or physical stress. Although the precise trigger in N.S's case is not identified  the symptoms occurred at a time of intense emotional distress.  Treatment and Outcomes N.S was managed concurrently by the cardiology and endocrinology teams  as her hypothyroid management regime was reviewed. She was started on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics. Her chest pain resolved the next day  and her condition improved rapidly over the next few days.   She was advised to avoid stressful situations and to start regular cardiac rehabilitation. She was followed closely in the clinic and a repeat echocardiogram after four weeks showed complete resolution of the previously seen wall motion abnormalities  confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Conclusion This case emphasizes the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chest pain and ECG changes suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome  particularly in postmenopausal women with recent stressful events. The management approach involves supportive care and addressing any potential triggers of the condition. 
15,7,35,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial35,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Middle-Aged Female: A Case Report  Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome) is a transient left ventricular dysfunction  often triggered by acute emotional or physical stressors. Although it resembles the clinical presentation of an acute myocardial infarction  patients usually have normal coronary arteries. This condition is more prevalent in post-menopausal women.  Case Presentation:  The case involves a 56-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and mild anxiety disorder  who presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. The pain was described as a 'heavy' sensation  associated with shortness of breath. She denied any nausea  vomiting  diaphoresis  or dizziness. The patient reported the sudden death of her husband two weeks ago. There were no known allergies and the patient denied any alcohol or substance abuse. She lived alone and worked as a school teacher.  Examination:  Initial vital signs were notable for a blood pressure of 155/92 mmHg  pulse rate of 110/min  respiratory rate of 22/min  temperature of 98.2°F  and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed an anxious-appearing woman in moderate distress. Respiratory examination was normal. Cardiovascular examination showed tachycardia with a regular rhythm  without any murmurs or added sounds. The rest of her examination was unremarkable.  Results:  Her ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads and her initial troponin levels were elevated (0.6 ng/mL). Subsequent troponin I level  after 2 hours  was 1.2 ng/mL  suggestive of an acute cardiac event. Surprisingly  the coronary angiography was normal without stenosis or plaque. The left ventriculogram  however  showed apical ballooning with preserved basal function  confirming the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her LV function and wall motion returned to normal over the course of three weeks on optimal medical management.  Treatment:  She was managed with aspirin  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  statin  and a short regimen of benzodiazepines given her known anxiety status and recent stressful loss. The patient was closely monitored with EKGs and cardiac enzymes and soon showed signs of improvement.  Conclusion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a unique and underdiagnosed type of heart failure precipitated by acute emotional or physical stress. Treatment involves medical management support and addressing the underlying stressor. This report exemplifies that physicians should be aware of this condition  particularly in post-menopausal women presenting with chest pain following acute stress. This incremental understanding can ultimately improve outcomes and reduce unnecessary procedures.
15,7,36,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial36,Title: A Rare Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 65-Year-Old Female Patient  History of Presenting Complaint: A 65-year-old African American female presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe  crushing mid-sternal chest pain that radiated to her left arm. The pain had started an hour prior to presentation following a heated altercation with her neighbor. The patient also reported shortness of breath  bouts of severe sweating and intermittent palpitations. She denied any nausea  vomiting  lightheadedness or blackouts. She was not suffering from any fever  cough or urinary symptoms.  Past Medical History: The patient had a known history of hypertension for the last 15 years and was being managed with Lisinopril. She was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes three years ago  which was being controlled through Metformin. She was a non-smoker and reported moderate alcohol consumption with no past history suggestive of cardiac diseases or familial tendencies.  Investigation Findings: Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads suggestive of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. Cardiac biomarkers were elevated  with troponin-I levels of 2.32 ng/mL (normal value < 0.04 ng/mL). However  bedside echocardiography revealed a peculiar finding of left ventricular (LV) apical ballooning with preserved function of the LV base  which did not correlate with a single coronary artery territory.  Management & Progress: Based on these findings  a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was suggested and confirmed by the coronary angiogram which demonstrated normal epicardial coronary arteries with no significant obstructive lesions. The patient was managed supportively with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and diuretics. No intervention was attempted as her blood pressure and heart rate remained steady. The patient's symptoms resolved over the following days with significant improvement in her cardiac function detected on subsequent echocardiography.  Outcome & Follow-up: The patient was discharged after a week with strict advice to remain compliant with her medications and to seek therapeutic stress management techniques to prevent recurrence of this condition. She was scheduled for a follow-up in a cardiology clinic  and during her follow-up visit a month later  her echocardiogram showed complete resolution of the LV dysfunction confirming the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Conclusion: This case underlines the significance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential in middle-aged and elderly patients presenting with chest pain and ECG changes suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction  particularly in the context of recent emotional stress or psychiatric illnesses.

She resides in an urban area of Chicago  Illinois and is a retired high school teacher. The patient is married with two adult children and is generally healthy  considering her age. She is a non-smoker and moderate alcohol drinker. She doesn't have any known drug allergies.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. A has a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension for which she has been on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) for the last ten years. She has occasional episodes of dyslipidemia but refuses statin therapy due to personal preferences. Mrs. A also experiences transient joint pain but no other history of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. She has no prior history of heart diseases or any family history of genetic or acquired heart conditions. Her last known ECG was normal.  Presenting Complaint:  Mrs. A presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset central chest pain associated with shortness of breath and profuse sweating. The symptoms started 3 hours prior to her arrival at the ED and were not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.  Clinical Findings:  On presentation  Mrs. A was in acute distress with a blood pressure of 170/90 mmHg  a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. She was afebrile. Her cardiac examination revealed a brisk radial pulse  normal S1  and S2 with no audible murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.   Diagnostic Assessment:  An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  mimicking a myocardial infarction. However  her cardiac biomarker (Troponin I) level was not significantly elevated. An echocardiogram showed left ventricular apical ballooning with preserved basal function  compatible with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Mrs. A was admitted to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring. Her treatment protocol included the continued use of her ACE-I  along with beta-blockers  aspirin  and lipid-lowering agents.   Follow-up and Outcomes:  After five days of hospitalization  her symptoms were manageable  ECG changes reversed  and echocardiogram revealed improved left ventricular function. She was discharged home with follow-up appointments with a cardiologist.  Patient Perspective:  Mrs. A acknowledged that she was under severe emotional stress due to the recent loss of her mother  which might have precipitated the condition.  Informed Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report and accompanying images.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the essential recognition of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is a stress-induced cardiomyopathy and can mimic myocardial infarction but lacks coronary artery obstruction. It's crucial to diagnose this condition promptly to initiate proper management and prevent potential complications.

She is an active community volunteer with no history of habitual smoking  drug  or alcohol abuse. She has no known allergies and is a widow with two adult children.  Past Medical History   Mrs. X has a controlled history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Other medical history includes osteoarthritis and previous history of anxiety and depression following the death of her husband three years ago. She is compliant with her daily antihypertensive  cholesterol-lowering  and antidepressant medications. There was no documented history of any cardiac disease before the current episode.   Clinical Presentation  On examination  Mrs. X was in acute distress with pallor and diaphoresis. Her blood pressure was 150/95 mmHg  pulse rate 110 beats/min  respiratory rate 25 breaths/min and body temperature at the reference value. Cardiac auscultation revealed tachycardia with minor bibasilar crackles detected on chest auscultation. Other body systems were unremarkable upon examination. The precordial chest pain was described as a severe  pressure-like sensation that radiated to the arms.   Diagnostic Assessment  The initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation with T-wave inversions in the precordial leads prompting immediate management for suspected acute myocardial infarction. However  coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease.   Echocardiography revealed apical ballooning with hypercontractile basal segments  indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Further blood tests showed elevated troponin levels with normal levels within three days.   In the preceding week  Mrs. X had been under severe emotional stress due to a significant project in her community volunteer work. Given the symptoms  exclusion of coronary artery disease  ECG changes  and acute stress  a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made.  Therapeutic Intervention  Mrs. X was treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors)  beta-blockers  and aspirin. She was advised to continue her medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Furthermore  psychological counseling intervention was suggested to help manage her stress levels.  Outcome  After five days in the hospital  she showed significant improvement in symptoms. Follow-up echocardiography performed eight weeks later revealed complete resolution of the previous wall motion abnormalities  with her ventricular function returning to normal.   Patient was educated on the need for continued stress management  medication adherence  and regular follow-up. Mrs. X was also advised to consider switching her volunteer work or delegate some responsibilities to others to reduce excess stress.  Conclusion  This case underscores the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential in postmenopausal women presenting with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome  especially when there is an identifiable stressor and absence of significant coronary artery disease.

Patient Information: The patient  a retired school teacher  residing in Brooklyn  New York  has a past medical history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. She was diagnosed with these illnesses ten years ago and has been on treatment since. The patient's medications include Metformin 500mg BID  Lisinopril 10 mg qDay and Atorvastatin 20mg qDay. She has no history of smoking  alcohol consumption  or illicit drug use.  Clinical Findings: The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain of sudden onset  radiating to her arm  accompanied by shortness of breath  sweating  and palpitations. The pain started a few hours after she received news of her son's unexpected death. She denied any previous episodes of chest pain or similar symptoms.   Diagnostic Assessment: On examination  the patient appeared anxious with cold peripheries. Her vital signs were: Blood Pressure 165/95 mmHg  Pulse rate 112/min  Respiratory rate 24/min  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Her cardiovascular system examination revealed tachycardia with normal S1 and S2  and no murmurs or added sounds. Her chest was clear to auscultation.  An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in precordial leads V1-V4  suggestive of an acute anterior myocardial infarction. However  her troponin T levels  though elevated  were not in proportion to ECG changes. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed akinesis of the mid and apical segments of the left ventricle  and hyperkinesis of the basal left ventricular segments  giving the typical """"ballooning"""" appearance  characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiogram revealed patent coronaries.  The diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made based on the Mayo Clinic criteria: transient hypokinesis  akinesis  or dyskinesis in the left ventricular mid segments with or without apical involvement; regional wall motion abnormalities extending beyond a single epicardial vascular distribution; new ECG abnormalities and modest elevation in cardiac troponin; absence of pheochromocytoma and myocarditis.   Therapeutic Intervention and Follow Up: She was treated with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and was given a short course of anxiolytic medication. She was also advised to start psychological counselling sessions. She responded well to the treatment.   Over a three-month follow-up  with heart failure medication and counselling  her symptoms completely resolved  and repeat echocardiography showed complete recovery of left ventricular function.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in individuals presenting with acute chest pain especially in the setting of intense emotional stress. Management with heart failure medication and stress management can help achieve full recovery."

She lives in suburban Illinois and is a divorced mother of two. She works as a high school teacher and has been under considerable stress due to the recent death of her father. She denies tobacco use  is a light alcohol drinker  and is not on any recreational drugs.   Past Medical History:   The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are managed by a low-dose statin and ACE inhibitors. She also suffers from moderate anxiety and depression managed with an SSRI. There is no history of percutaneous coronary intervention or myocardial infarction  and there is no family history of early coronary arteries disease. Routine colonoscopy  mammogram  and pap smear screenings are reported to be up-to-date. Her last EKG was performed three years ago  and it was reported within normal limits.  Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  her blood pressure was slightly elevated at 150/95 mm Hg. The heart rate was regular at 80 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute  with oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. No jugular venous distention was noticed. Cardiovascular examination revealed regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs. No palpable heave or thrill was noted. Rest of the physical examination was within normal limits.   Diagnostic Assessment:   An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads V2 through V5. Blood tests showed a slightly elevated troponin level. Echocardiogram showed reduced ejection fraction of 40% with apical ballooning  indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient was admitted for close monitoring. Coronary angiography was performed and showed no presence of obstructive coronary disease to account for her symptoms and electrocardiogram changes.  Therapeutic Intervention:   While in the hospital  the patient was initiated on a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor. She continued her low-dose statin therapy and was closely monitored in the cardiac care unit. Counseling for stress management and discussions about possible modifications to her SSRIs to better manage her anxiety and depression were initiated.  Follow Up:   On follow-up two months later  repeat EKG showed improvement of ST-segments and echocardiogram showed normalized left ventricular ejection fraction. Symptoms of chest pain had resolved and the patient reported managing better with her psychic stressors.   Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in post-menopausal females presenting with chest pain  particularly in the context of recent intense emotional stress and the absence of significant coronary artery disease. 
15,7,41,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial41,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman: A Case Report  Introduction:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is an acute transient cardiac syndrome mimicking an acute myocardial infarction  typically triggered by physical or emotional stress.   Case Presentation: Our patient is a 78-year-old Caucasian female  a widowed non-smoker with a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain after receiving news of her brother's death. The pain described was epigastric  radiating to the left arm  and associated with shortness of breath.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  she was stable with a blood pressure of 150/85 mmHg  heart rate of 90 bpm  and respiratory rate of 18 per minute. She appeared anxious and diaphoretic. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal S1 and S2  with no murmurs. Chest roentgenogram was unremarkable. ECG showed diffuse ST-segment elevations suggestive of an anterior wall myocardial infarction. Laboratory investigations revealed slightly elevated troponin-I levels.   Diagnosis: The patient underwent an emergency coronary angiogram  which surprisingly revealed no significant coronary disease. Echocardiography showed systolic apical ballooning with preserved basal function affirming the diagnosis of TTC.  Treatment:  The patient was admitted to the cardiology unit and initiated on guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure  including a beta-blocker  ACE inhibitor  and diuretic. She was also referred to the psychiatric unit for management of her acute emotional stress.  Outcome:  She responded well to her medical therapy with resolution of her chest pain and improvement in her cardiac function as evidenced on follow-up echocardiography after four weeks. Psychotherapy was also beneficial in dealing with her psychosocial stress.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the significance of TTC as a differential diagnosis in women  particularly post-menopausal  presenting with symptoms of acute chest pain in the backdrop of intense emotional stress. Although the pathophysiology of TTC isn't entirely elucidated  early recognition and appropriate management of this condition can substantially improve patient outcomes.

She has been an active member of her community with no history of smoking or illicit drug use  and occasional consumption of alcohol. She is widowed and has recently lost her only son  leading to significant emotional stress.  Clinical Findings: Mrs. A presented to the Emergency Department with abrupt onset severe chest pain radiating to her left arm and dyspnea. On examination  she was found to be tachycardic and hypertensive. An initial ECG demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  suggestive of an anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  her cardiovascular examination was unremarkable apart from tachycardia  and her respiratory examinations revealed clear lung fields. Additionally  no signs of significant peripheral edema were observed.  Timeline: Mrs. A began experiencing symptoms early in the morning and was brought to the Emergency Department within two hours of onset. She was triaged immediately  and a series of investigations were started promptly. Blood work  troponin levels  electrocardiography  and echocardiography were conducted within the first 12 hours of her arrival.  Diagnostic Assessment: Laboratory tests showed elevated cardiac enzymes (troponin I levels) indicative of myocardial injury. Initial troponin I was reported as high as 4.35 ng/mL (normal: <0.04 ng/mL). She underwent a coronary angiography  which demonstrated normal coronary arteries without significant atherosclerotic disease. An echocardiogram revealed a reduced ejection fraction of 35%  along with characteristic apical ballooning and hypercontractile basal segments  suggesting a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Therapeutic Intervention: Mrs. A was admitted to the cardiology unit for observation. She was started on conservative management with standard heart failure medications  including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics  as per the cardiac consultants.   Follow-Up and Outcomes: Over the next few days  Mrs. A's symptoms improved significantly  and repeat echocardiogram a week later showed normalization of left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 55%. On discharge  she was scheduled for ongoing outpatient cardiac follow-up and referred to a psychologist for counseling and potential pharmacologic therapy for her stress and grief.  Patient Perspective: Mrs. A was understandably apprehensive during her hospitalization but was relieved to learn her coronary arteries were healthy. She acknowledged the recent stress in her life and was open to seeking psychological help.  Informed Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for this case report.   Key Learning Points:  This case highlights the relevance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome """" when managing acute chest pain  especially in postmenopausal women with recent emotional stress despite being in demand ischemic symptoms."
15,7,43,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial43,Title: Acute Left Ventricular (LV) Dysfunction in a 60-year-old Female: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome or stress-induced cardiomyopathy  is a transient LV dysfunction often triggered by acute emotional or physical stress events. While its presentation is similar to acute myocardial infarction  the distinguishing factor is the preservation of the coronary arteries without significant blockages.   Case Summary: The patient  a 60-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain of sudden onset. The patient described the pain as central  radiating to the left arm  and increasing with deep breaths. The pain was not relieved by rest. The patient recently suffered the loss of her husband a week ago.  Past Medical History: The patient reported a history of high blood pressure  managed with Lisinopril 10mg daily. She has no history of diabetes  familial cardiac disease  smoking  or illicit drug use. Her surgical history is unremarkable. She is a retired school teacher who lives alone.  Examination and Results: The initial evaluation showed the patient to be in distress  with vital signs within normal range and with a heart rate of 110 beats/min  blood pressure of 140/90mmHg. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads without pathological Q waves. Blood tests showed a moderate rise in troponin level. Urgent coronary angiography was performed  which revealed patent coronary arteries with no significant obstruction or atherosclerosis.   On subsequent echocardiography  considerable apical ballooning of the left ventricle with systolic dysfunction was witnessed. Based on her medical history  physical findings  and imaging reports  a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made.  Treatment: She was started on aspirin  beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and statins. Her symptoms improved over the following days  with subsequent echocardiograms showing gradual normalization of LV function. She was recommended psychological support to help cope with the emotional stress following her loss.  Conclusion: This case highlights Takotsubo cardiomyopathy's presentation in a post-menopausal woman under significant emotional stress  mimicking acute coronary syndrome. Whilst it is a relatively rare condition  it is vital to remember this diagnosis in atypical presentations of chest pain  particularly in post-menopausal women under stress. It reaffirms the significant impact of psychological health on physical wellbeing.
15,7,44,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial44,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman: A Case Report  Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" is a transient cardiac syndrome mimicking an acute myocardial infarction  typically provoked by intense physical or emotional stress. This report presents the case of a 68-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy following a major stressful event.  Patient information: The patient  Mrs. A  is a 68-year-old Caucasian postmenopausal female with no prior known medical conditions. She is a widow living alone and reported no regular medication use. She neither smoked  consumed alcohol excessively  nor abused other substances. She had a moderate level of physical activity and followed a balanced diet.  Clinical findings: Mrs. A was admitted to the emergency department with severe chest pain  hypotension (BP 90/60 mm Hg)  and diaphoresis  which developed immediately following a minor car accident. Initial evaluation showed tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Examination of other systems was unremarkable.  Timeline: Initial lab investigations showed elevated cardiac enzyme levels—Troponin T was at 0.31 ng/ml (normal 0.00-0.1 ng/ml)  and Creatine Kinase-MB (CK-MB) was 56 U/L (normal 0-25 U/L). Emergency ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  raising a suspicion for acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. The echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal segments  which are typical findings in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Diagnostic Assessment: Coronary angiography did not show any significant obstructive coronary artery disease. The left ventriculogram confirmed the presence of apical ballooning. Based on these findings  a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made.  Therapeutic Intervention: She was admitted to the cardiovascular intensive care unit for close monitoring and supportive care. Treatment with aspirin  clopidogrel  and supportive measures like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was initiated. Emotional counseling and therapy were also provided to manage the psychological stress due to the accident.  Follow-up and outcomes: Checkpoint echocardiogram performed at two weeks showed near-normal left ventricular function. The patient stayed symptom-free for six months of follow-up. She continued with regular cardiac rehabilitation and psychological therapy sessions.  Patient Perspective: The unexpected diagnosis of cardiomyopathy induced by an emotional trigger was initially challenging for Mrs. A to accept. However  with ongoing emotional counseling and education about her condition  she felt more empowered and reassured about her prognosis.  Informed Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.  Conclusion: This case serves as a reminder to clinicians about the potential of stress-induced cardiomyopathy or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in patients who present with acute coronary syndrome symptoms following emotionally stressful events. Quick recognition and appropriate supportive care can lead to excellent outcomes in these patients. "
15,7,45,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial45,Title: An Older Female Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Misinterpreted as Acute Coronary Syndrome  Patient Profile:  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian female referred to the cardiology department presenting with chest pain  shortness of breath  and nausea.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She is a non-smoker with occasional alcohol consumption. She has been managing her hypertension with a combination of diuretics and ACE inhibitors for the past 10 years. Her hyperlipidemia has been managed with statins for eight years.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented with severe central chest pain  shortness of breath  and nausea that developed suddenly after she received news about the death of her older brother.  Physical Examination:  Her blood pressure was 165/90 mmHg with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal S1 and S2 with no added sounds. No carotid bruits were heard. Lung examination showed clear bilateral air entry with no added sounds. Her abdomen was soft  non-tender with no organomegaly.  Investigations:  Initially  an electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation  which resulted in a suspicion of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Coronary angiography was performed  did not show any significant obstructive coronary disease. The left ventriculogram revealed hypokinesia of the mid-distal sections of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal sections. Laboratory tests showed elevated troponin level of 2.3 ng/ml (0.00-0.04). Other tests including complete blood count  glucose  potassium  creatinine  and liver function tests were within normal limits.  Diagnosis:  Given the characteristic features of hypokinesia of the left ventricular midsections with hyperkinesis of the basal sections  along with elevated cardiac biomarkers in the absence of obstructive coronary disease  the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy – a condition commonly triggered by intense emotional or physical stress leading to severe heart muscle failure.  Treatment:  The patient was managed conservatively in the cardiac care unit. She was given angiotensin receptor blockers and Beta-blockers to stabilize her condition. Her symptoms subsided gradually over the following days  and serial echocardiograms showed a return to normal left ventricular function within a week.  Discussion:  This case underscores the need for health professionals to be aware of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome'  as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of ACS. Astonishingly  this condition can mimic ACS  with sudden onset chest pain  ST-segment elevation on ECG  and transient left ventricular dysfunction  but does not involve coronary artery blockages. The treatment is generally supportive  and most patients recover fully with careful management. 
15,7,46,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial46,Patient Information: Ms. A  67-year-old Caucasian female  Subjective: The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain of sudden onset  associated with shortness of breath. The pain was described as a tight  squeezing pressure in the center of her chest  which then radiated down her left arm and up to her jaw. The patient denied any previous history of such symptoms. She also shared she was currently going through a divorce  indicating high levels of emotional stress.  Past Medical History: Ms. A had a past medical history of hypertension and had maintained optimal control of her blood pressure with prescribed antihypertensive therapy for over five years. She revealed that she is a non-smoker and maintains a moderate level of physical activity. Prior to these symptoms  no coronary artery disease  diabetes  or hyperlipidemia was reported. She had no personal or family history of cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac death.   Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and in distress. She had elevated blood pressure at 165/95mmHg and tachycardia with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute. Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings were indicative of ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  simulating an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. Troponin level was slightly elevated.  Diagnosis: She was initially diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). However  given the absence of atherosclerotic risk factors  an emergent cardiac angiography was performed which revealed patent coronary arteries without any blockages. The presence of apical ballooning of her left ventricle on ventriculography led to the suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Treatment: Ms. A was immediately admitted to the ICU where she was given supportive care  including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics. She was counseled about stress management and referred to a psychologist for further aid in this area.  Progress & Follow-Up: After a hospital stay of five days  the patient's symptoms completely resolved  and she was discharged with prescriptions for continuing her antihypertensive therapy and newly-prescribed medications. She was asked to follow up at a cardiology outpatient clinic.  On her first follow-up after one month  ECG and echocardiography revealed complete resolution of the ST-segment elevation and apical ballooning  conforming to the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Four months following the event  Ms. A was doing well without any recurrence of symptoms and had made progress in managing her emotional stress.  This case underscores the relationship between emotional stress and takotsubo cardiomyopathy  emphasizing the importance of identifying and managing emotional triggers in susceptible individuals.
15,7,47,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial47,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female. She resides in Leicester  England  where she has lived for the majority of her life. She is a retired schoolteacher and currently lives alone. She is a non-smoker and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. Her medical history includes hypothyroidism and hypertension  both of which are well-controlled with medication. She has no known allergies.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  dyspnea  and a feeling of impending doom  symptoms that indicate a potential myocardial infarction. The patient described the onset of symptoms as sudden and intense. Further discussion revealed that she experienced a significant emotional stress event: the unexpected death of her son three days prior to admission.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) indicated ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Blood tests showed a mildly increased troponin level but were inconclusive for a definitive myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram demonstrated a significant mid and apical segment hypokinesis with basal hyperkinesis  producing a classic """"octopus pot"""" appearance  suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. These findings were subsequently confirmed with a coronary angiogram  which revealed no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease but confirmed the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC).  Therapeutic Intervention:  Immediate therapy included supportive care with oxygen  low-dose aspirin  and nitroglycerin. Post-diagnosis  the patient was closely monitored  and her symptoms were managed with heart failure medications  including beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and diuretics. As TTC is often a reaction to severe stress  the patient was also offered counselling and stress management strategies to assist with her emotional well-being.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  The patient responded well to treatment and showed gradually improved cardiac function over the course of several weeks. Follow-up echocardiograms showed resolution of previously noted wall motion abnormalities  and she was symptom-free at the time of discharge. Long-term monitoring and patient education regarding symptom recognition and stress management were planned as part of her continuing care.  Patient Perspective:  The patient expressed relief upon learning that she had not suffered a heart attack  but she was surprised to comprehend the physical impact of severe emotional stress. The incident significantly increased her interest in stress management and mental health support.  Conclusions:  This case highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in individuals presenting with chest pain and emotional stress. Appropriate management requires a comprehensive approach involving not only medical treatment but also psychological support. It underscores the role of a stressful event in precipitating takotsubo cardiomyopathy  the importance of early recognition  and the necessity of targeted treatment protocols based on the unique pathology of this condition.

15,7,48,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial48,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Female Patient  Patient Information  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female who presented to the Emergency Department. She is a lifetime non-smoker and exercises regularly. Her family history is significant for hypertension and cardiovascular diseases  but she has no pre-existing personal history of cardiac disorders. The patient lives alone and has reported experiencing long-term stress due to considerable personal and financial worries.   Clinical Findings  She presented with acute onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath  symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However  she also reported unexpected stress she had encountered earlier in the day.  Diagnostic Assessment  An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment elevation in the anterolateral leads  a sign typical of AMI. Initial laboratory tests  including complete blood count  electrolytes  and kidney function  were within normal ranges. However  her troponin I levels were elevated (0.76 ng/ml).   A coronary angiogram was conducted to assess for possible coronary artery disease. Interestingly  the angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries  which is inconsistent with the clinical suspicion of AMI. A subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram showed abnormal motion of the left ventricular wall  along with reduced ejection fraction (45%). Moreover  the characteristic apical ballooning shape  resembling a Japanese octopus trap (Takotsubo)  was observed. These findings  in combination with her elevated stress levels  led to a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).   Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was initiated on beta-blocker therapy (metoprolol)  along with ACE inhibitors (lisinopril) to manage her heart failure symptoms. She also received aspirin and statins for secondary prevention of any potential cardiovascular event. Psychological counselling was recommended to help her cope with chronic stress.   Follow-up and Outcomes  She remained in the hospital for monitoring for a week. Her symptoms started improving by Day 3. Repeat echocardiogram at six-weeks follow-up showed complete recovery of left ventricular function  suggesting typical course of TCM. She also reported better management of stress after attending regular counselling.  Discussion  This case highlights that TCM  often mimicking AMI  can occur even in the absence of significant cardiac history. It is important to note that TCM is mostly seen post-menopause in women  and often an emotional or physical stressor can be identified. In this case  chronic stress appears to have led to her presentation. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial in ensuring recovery from this reversible cardiomyopathy.   Patient Perspective  The patient reported that she was startled by the severe chest pain. However  it was comforting to know her heart disease was reversible  and was satisfied with her care management. She emphasized the psychological component of her disease and shared her commitment to focus on stress management.  Informed Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report. 
15,7,49,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial49,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 65-year-old Female: A Case Report  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a transient left ventricular dysfunction often precipitated by severe physical or emotional stress. This cardiomyopathy typically mimics acute myocardial infarction  presenting with chest pain and changes in the electrocardiogram.  Patient Information: We report on a 65-year-old Caucasian female who presented to the emergency room with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient resides in a suburban community in Dallas  Texas  and is retired. She lives with her husband  has three grown children  and owns two pets. She is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient appeared acutely distressed with cold and clammy skin. Her vitals revealed a blood pressure of 120/90 mmHg  pulse 107 bpm  respirations 28 per minute  and oxygen saturation 92% on room air.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history of hyperlipidemia and osteoarthritis. She had no previous history of cardiovascular diseases or strokes. Her medication regimen includes statins for her hyperlipidemia and occasional NSAIDs for joint pain.  Diagnostic Assessment: Complete blood count  metabolic panel  and cardiac biomarkers were obtained. Our patient had a slight elevation in cardiac troponin levels  raising suspicions of an acute coronary syndrome. An urgent electrocardiogram displayed prolonged QT interval and ST-segment elevation. However  coronary angiography ruled out significant coronary artery disease. The transthoracic echocardiography revealed a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with characteristic apical ballooning.   Therapeutic Intervention: Treatment was supportive concerning her symptoms and clinical findings. The patient received standard heart failure medications  including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics.   Follow-up and Outcome: On a follow-up examination after two months  repeat echocardiography showed a complete recovery of left ventricular function  thus confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Patient Perspective: The patient reported a high level of stress due to the recent loss of her mother  which likely triggered her Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Since her recovery  she has been working with a therapist to manage her stress and grief.  Conclusion: This case highlights the crucial role of careful diagnostic evaluation in ruling out more common causes of acute chest pain. Clinicians should be aware of conditions like Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  particularly in post-menopausal women with recent severe emotional or physical stress. Timely intervention and supportive care play a significant role in the patient's recovery and prognosis.
15,7,50,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial50,Patient Information  Demographics: 58-year-old Caucasian female  Presenting concerns: The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of intense chest pain and shortness of breath that started a few hours earlier. She was experiencing severe emotional stress due to her husband's recent untimely death.  Medical history: The patient reported no significant past medical history. She was a non-smoker and led an active lifestyle with regular exercise.  Diagnostic focus and assessment:  On physical examination  she appeared anxious and showed signs of respiratory distress. She had elevated blood pressure with 155/85 mmHg and a heart rate of 100 bpm. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  initially leading us to suspect an acute myocardial infarction. However  the patient's subsequent troponin levels  although raised  were not consistent with the significant ST-segment changes noted on the ECG  raising suspicion for a different diagnosis. A transthoracic echocardiogram was subsequently performed  which showed apical ballooning with preserved function of the basal segments  a pattern characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Clinical Findings:  In addition to these findings  the patient's complete blood count  electrolytes  creatinine  and liver function tests were normal. Her fasting glucose and cholesterol were within normal levels  while thyroid function tests were borderline normal. The Coronary angiogram revealed no obstructive coronary disease ruling out a myocardial infarction.   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was initially managed as an acute coronary syndrome. She was started on aspirin  clopidogrel  and heparin. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers were added after the tentative diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her symptoms and heart failure were managed with diuretics and meticulous fluid balance.   Follow-Up and Outcomes:  Over the following days  her symptoms  ECG changes  and cardiac biomarkers markedly improved. She was discharged home after a week in the hospital. On a one-month follow-up appointment  echocardiography showed complete resolution of wall motion abnormalities consistent with a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She was informed and counseled about the condition and its association with intense emotional stress.   Patient Perspective:  The patient was appreciative of the care received and expressed her commitment to managing emotional stress more effectively utilizing recommended therapy and counseling.  Informed Consent:  The patient gave informed consent for her anonymized information to be published in this case report.  Teaching Points:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy  is an important differential diagnosis in patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome  particularly when the clinical presentation is atypical or the cardiac biomarker profile does not fit with the degree of ECG changes. The condition is often preceded by emotional or physical stress and primarily affects postmenopausal women. Although its exact mechanism is not clearly understood  takotsubo cardiomyopathy is reversible and typically carries a good prognosis if recognized and managed appropriately. 
15,7,51,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial51,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in an 58-year-old Female Patient  Patient Profile: Patient is a 58-year-old Asian female presenting with symptoms of acute chest pain and shortness of breath. Her BMI is 28.8 and she has no history of smoking or alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension  Type 2 diabetes  but no known cardiac history. Her hypertension and diabetes have been well-managed with medication. She possesses no allergies  has no previous surgeries  and is generally in good health. She follows a balanced diet  exercises regularly  but has a stressful job as a senior manager in a corporate firm.   Family History: The patient's father had hypertension and her mother had Type 2 diabetes. There is no known hereditary cardiac illness in her immediate family.    Presenting Symptoms: Patient initially visited the outpatient department with complaints of acute chest pain  dyspnea  nausea  and anxiety. She reported the pain radiated towards the left arm  replicating symptoms similar to a myocardial infarction. She also showed signs of mild tachycardia.  Diagnostic Assessment: Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ST-segment elevation  indicative of potential acute coronary syndrome. However  cardiac biomarker levels were moderately elevated  twisted with the ECG findings. Subsequent coronary angiography revealed no significant occlusive disease to explain the ECG changes. An Echocardiogram showed a hyperdynamic left ventricle with apical ballooning and preserved basal function  indicative of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome  or stress cardiomyopathy).   Treatment: Given the confirmation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  the patient was initially managed with beta-blocker therapy (Carvedilol)  Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and supportive measures to reduce her stress levels. Encouragingly  she responded well to medication and was stable throughout her hospital stay. Psychotherapy sessions were also initiated to help the patient deal with her workplace stress.  Follow-up and Prognosis: The patient was discharged home in a stable condition after a week  with advice on maintaining good glycemic control  strict control of blood pressure  continuation of medication as prescribed  and stress management. Periodic echocardiography and therapeutic guidance on lifestyle changes and stress management were recommended. At a 3-month follow-up  the patient’s symptoms had improved significantly and her repeat echocardiography showed a complete reversal of the initial abnormality  confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chest pain  particularly when the ECG changes and symptoms mimic a myocardial infarction  but there's no corroborative angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease. Besides  it highlights the role of stress management in patients who demonstrate a strong correlation between their symptoms and underlying emotional or psychological stress.

15,7,53,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial53,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 65-Year-Old Female Following Emotional Stress  Abstract: This report describes the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian female diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy after experiencing severe emotional stress.  Case Presentation:   The patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm along with episodes of fatigue and faintness. The onset of these symptoms followed shortly after hearing about the sudden death of her elder sister  with whom she was very close. She holds a master's degree in education  is a retired schoolteacher  and a widow with two adult children. Her lifestyle can be regarded as sedentary  without any history of smoking  alcohol  or substance misuse.  Past Medical History:   Her past medical history includes hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago  controlled using a daily dosage of 5mg amlodipine besilate  with regular follow-up assessments showing satisfactory management. She does not have any known allergies but does have a family history of cardiovascular disease; her father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 72.  Clinical Findings:   On initial examination in the ED  the patient was alert and oriented but appeared visibly distressed. Vital signs demonstrated a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  a pulse of 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute  and a temperature of 98.6F. Physical examination revealed a 3/6 systolic murmur on the left sternal border. No other abnormalities were discerned.  Diagnostic Assessment:  The ECG done at the ED revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterior and inferior leads suggesting acute coronary syndrome. However  her Troponin levels were mildly elevated  inconsistent with the severe ECG changes. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal walls consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Left heart catheterization illustrated no coronary arterial occlusion  further confirming the diagnosis.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was admitted to the cardiac care unit and started on beta-blockers  an ACE inhibitor  and a statin. Gradually  her symptomatology improved  and she was discharged home in stable condition after 5 days. During outpatient follow up after 6 weeks  the patient remained asymptomatic  and repeat echocardiography showed resolution of the wall motion abnormalities  indicating recovery from the episode.  Conclusions:  This case highlights that emotional stressors can trigger takotsubo cardiomyopathy in postmenopausal women  especially those with hypertension. Awareness of this condition among clinicians is essential to ensure timely and appropriate management  which ultimately results in excellent prognosis.

An echocardiogram showed left ventricular apical ballooning with preserved basal function  leading to the suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiography confirmed the absence of significant coronary artery disease  which supported the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Therapeutic Intervention:  She was commenced on beta-blockers to manage her blood pressure  alongside aspirin  a statin  and a medication to reduce the risk of blood clots. She was also provided with eplerenone  an aldosterone antagonist  and was kept under careful observation.  Follow-up and Outcomes:   Following this treatment  Ms. A’s chest pain subsided  and her symptoms improved. Over a period of 4-6 weeks  repeat echocardiography indicated the normalization of her left ventricular function. She was discharged with instructions to continue medication and was scheduled for regular follow-ups.  Clinical Lessons from the Case:  This case underlines the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation  particularly postmenopausal women confronted with sudden emotional stress. While the exact cause of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is unknown  it is often triggered by severe stress. It is crucial to note that despite similar clinical presentation  management and prognosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy significantly differ from that of a typical myocardial infarction.  
15,7,55,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial55,Patient Information: • Initials: M.K. • Age: 72 • Gender: Female • Ethnicity: Caucasian • Occupation: Retired Teacher  Case Presentation: M.K.  a 72-year-old Caucasian female patient  presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute chest pain. The pain started suddenly  central and intense  without any identifiable triggering factor. The patient reported that the chest pain felt like a 'tight band' across her chest. The pain was unrelieved by rest and nitroglycerine. She complained of associated shortness of breath. There were no other associated symptoms like nausea  vomiting  or palpitations.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension for the past 10 years and is on regular medication (Losartan 50 mg/day). She is post-menopausal and has a past surgical history of total abdominal hysterectomy 15 years ago for uterine fibroids. M.K. does not have a history of heart disease  does not smoke  or use alcohol excessively  and maintains a fairly active lifestyle for her age.  Physical Examination & Diagnostic Findings: Upon examination in the ED  MK was anxious and diaphoretic. Her blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg  heart rate 100 bpm  and respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The cardiovascular examination revealed normal S1 and S2 without any additional heart sounds or murmurs. The results of the rest of the physical examination were unremarkable. Her initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads V2-6  suggesting an acute myocardial infarction (MI).   However  coronary angiography  performed suspecting an acute coronary syndrome  showed no significant coronary artery disease to explain the patient’s pain and ECG alterations. The left ventriculography showed typical apical ballooning with basal hypercontractility  suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This was further substantiated by a raised troponin I level of 4.5 ng/ml (normal range 0 - 0.4 ng/ml) and a slightly increased pro-BNP of 600 pg/ml (normal range 0 - 100pg/ml).  Treatment & Outcome: Considering the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  the patient received supportive treatment  including aspirin  beta-blockers  and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. She reported significant relief from the chest pain and was stable over the next few days. Repeat echocardiography after two weeks showed complete resolution of wall motion abnormalities  which is consistent with TTC.   This case report underscores the importance of recognizing TTC as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain  especially in post-menopausal women. It highlights the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment  which generally result in good clinical outcome in these patients.
15,7,56,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial56,Patient Information:  Ms. X is a 72-year-old Caucasian female who arrived at the Emergency Department (ED) with shortness of breath  chest pain and discomfort. She reported that the symptoms started abruptly after she heard about the unexpected death of her brother.   Medical History:  The patient's past medical history was significant including hypertension  hyperlipidemia and osteoarthritis. She had no known history of coronary artery disease or any other heart-related conditions. Her medications included Amlodipine 5mg daily  Atorvastatin 20mg at bed time and Ibuprofen 400mg as needed for pain. She was a non-smoker and consumed alcohol moderately. Up to the event  Ms. X had been living independently and was in her usual state of physical health.  Evaluation:  On examination  she appeared in acute distress. Her vital signs: BP 150/95mmHg  heart rate was 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  temperature of 98.8 F and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed no murmur or gallops. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Her EKG showed ST segment elevation in the anterior leads. Initial laboratory results were significant for Troponin-I level of 0.9 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL) and a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 800 pg/mL (normal <100 pg/mL).  Treatment:  She was immediately started on aspirin  nitroglycerin  and heparin and moved to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) with the suspicion of anterior wall myocardial infarction. Emergent cardiac catheterization however revealed normal coronary arteries. On left ventriculogram  the characteristic finding of apical ballooning with preserved basal function was observed  which confirmed the clinical suspicion of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as Stress Cardiomyopathy or Broken Heart Syndrome).  Outcome:  Ms. X received supportive therapy including beta blockers and ACE inhibitors. Her chest pain resolved over the next 48 hours. Repeat echocardiogram done a week later showed near normalization of left ventricular function. She was subsequently discharged with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Conclusion:  This case represents a classic example of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition often triggered by significant emotional stress. This condition often mimics myocardial infarction and should be considered in the differential diagnosis in appropriate settings. Importantly  with supportive management and elimination of inciting stressors  prognosis is generally favorable with full recovery of cardiac function in the majority of patients.
15,7,57,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial57,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman: A Case Report   Case Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  with a medical history significant for hypertension  mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  and hyperlipidemia. She is neither a smoker nor has a family history of early-onset heart disease. She was presenting to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset chest pain and difficulty in breathing. The pain was described as central  intense  and radiating to the left arm.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  the patient was afebrile with irregular heartbeats and elevated blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4  quite similar to that seen in acute myocardial infarction. No other significant abnormal findings were noted during examination.  Timeline:  The patient's symptoms appeared abruptly whilst she was attending her grandson’s wedding. The onset was not associated with physical exertion. She mentioned extreme emotional distress during the event due to a significant dispute. The symptoms had lasted approximately 3 hours before she arrived at the emergency department.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Initial assessment  based on symptoms and ECG  pointed towards acute myocardial infarction. However  biochemical markers demonstrated a slight increase in troponin I level  incongruous with typical myocardial infarction levels. Computed Tomography (CT) coronary angiography was therefore undertaken and interestingly  revealed no significant obstructive coronary disease.  An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram showed reduced left ventricular function with apical ballooning and basal hypercontractility  which is characteristic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was managed with conservative measures  including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and statins  which she tolerated well.  Follow-up and outcomes:  Follow-up echocardiogram was performed after 6 weeks  which demonstrated complete normalization of the left ventricular function  confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy retrospectively. She remained asymptomatic and continued to be on statins and ACE inhibitors for her hypertension.  Conclusion:  The case highlights the importance of understanding and recognizing TCM  which can mimic myocardial infarction. This report also underlines the potential role of emotional triggers in the development of TCM  especially in postmenopausal women with a history of hypertension. Careful diagnostic evaluation is critical in such patients to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and to conduct appropriate management.
15,7,58,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial58,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman Following a Severe Emotional Event - A Case Report  Case Report:  Patient Information:  A 66 year-old Caucasian woman with no known previous medical history presented to the ER with severe chest pain and palpitations. She was recently widowed  losing her husband of 45 years a month ago  and reported substantial emotional stress and depression since his death.  Clinical Findings:  At her arrival  she was hypertensive with blood pressure measuring 155/90 mmHg  and tachycardic with pulse rate of 110 beats per minute. EKG showed ST segment elevation in the precordial leads suggestive of anterior wall myocardial infarction. Auscultation revealed no abnormal heart sounds or murmurs.   Diagnostic Assessment: Her initial laboratory workup was significant for elevated troponin levels to 1.2 ng/mL and Brain Natriuretic Peptide(BNP) of 950 pg/ml. Transthoracic echocardiogram depicted the characteristic apical ballooning with hypercontractile basal segments. Left ventricular ejection fraction was evaluated to be approximately 35%. Coronary angiogram did not demonstrate any significant coronary artery disease.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initially treated with aspirin  nitroglycerin and beta blockers for suspected myocardial infarction. Once takotsubo cardiomyopathy was identified  she was continued on the beta blocker (metoprolol) and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (enalapril) was added. She was also provided psychological counselling and prescribed an antidepressant (escitalopram) due to severe emotional trauma and depression.   Follow-Up & Outcome: Consecutive echocardiograms over the next four weeks showed progressive resolution of left ventricular function with ejection fraction returning to normal. The antidepressant treatment was effective in reducing her depressive symptoms. During her 6 month follow-up  she reported significant improvement in her wellbeing and her EKG  echocardiogram and lab results (including troponin and BNP levels) were all within the normal range.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed gratitude towards the medical team for the precise diagnosis and treatment. She also emphasized the role of psychological assistance  stating it was indispensable for her recovery.  Conclusion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy  is a condition that may mimic acute coronary syndrome. This case emphasizes the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis when encountering patients  particularly post-menopausal women presenting with chest pain after a recent emotional event  even in absence of prior cardiac history. An optimal therapeutic approach seems to be a combination of medical therapy and psychological support.

She is a retired school teacher  nondrinker  nonsmoker with a body mass index of 26 kg/m^2. She lives with her husband in rural Maine.   History of Present Illness:  The patient reported acute onset of severe chest pain that started two hours prior to arrival at our centre. The pain was retrosternal  severe  and crushing in nature leading to shortness of breath. It occurred spontaneously during rest at home and was not linked to any physical exertion. The patient reported significant mental stress in relation to a recent traumatic event in her life – the unexpected demise of her only son  which occurred two weeks prior to the presentation.  Past Medical and Family History:  Mrs. A's past medical history is notable for hypertension  which is well controlled on a low-dose Diuretic (Hydrochlorothiazide). She denied any history of diabetes  dyslipidemia  renal diseases  pulmonary diseases  or any significant family history of cardiovascular events.   Clinical Findings:  On admission  Mrs. A was conscious  oriented and showed signs of palpable distress. Vital signs recorded an elevated blood pressure of 170/90mmHg  pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate was 22 per minute and oxygen saturation was 94% on ambient air. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities  apart from an elevated jugular venous pressure.   Diagnostic Assessments:  Electrocardiogram revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. However  the patient's initial troponin I level was mildly elevated at 0.10ng/mL  an unexpected finding for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). An emergent coronary angiogram revealed no significant coronary artery disease. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated significant hypokinesis of the mid to apical segments of the left ventricle  along with preserved basal function  favoring a diagnosis of Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy. These findings were reconfirmed by a subsequent cardiac MRI.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Appropriate medical therapy for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was initiated  including Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers and anxiolytics. Individualized counseling was offered to help her cope with her bereavement.  Follow-up:  During her follow-up at our outpatient clinic four weeks later  Mrs. A reported resolution of her chest discomfort and was asymptomatic at baseline. Repeat echocardiography revealed full recovery of the left ventricular function.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the typical clinical presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy seen in post-menopausal women experiencing emotional stress. It emphasizes the important role of detailed diagnostic investigations in distinguishing this condition from acute coronary syndrome. The patient made a full recovery with standard heart failure treatment and psychological support.
15,7,60,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial60,"Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. B (Patient's identity protected) Sex: Female Age: 65 years Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Summary:  Mrs. B  a 65-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain. The pain was described as crushing in nature  and it radiated to the left arm. There was associated shortness of breath  dizziness  and profuse sweating. Mrs. B stated that these symptoms developed suddenly while she was attending her husband's funeral.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. B had been previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She was on Metformin 500mg twice daily  Lisinopril 10mg once daily  and Amlodipine 5mg once daily. There were no known allergies to medication. Her medications were up-to-date  and she had been compliant with her treatment regimen. She'd never smoked nor consumed alcohol in her lifestyle.  Emergency Room Assessment:  On initial assessment  Mrs. B appeared anxious  she was diaphoretic  and her skin was relatively cold and clammy. She had elevated blood pressure (160/90 mmHg) and an increased heart rate (110 bpm). Her oxygen saturation was acceptable (96% on room air).  Investigations & Findings:  An ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anteroseptal leads  which suggested a possible acute myocardial infarction. Serum troponin I levels were raised. She immediately underwent angiography  which did not show any significant blockage that might cause a heart attack. Ultrasound of the heart (Echocardiogram) showed apical balooning with a hyperdynamic base of the heart  a feature characteristic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Diagnosis:  Based on the presenting symptoms  investigative findings  and especially the emotional stressor - her husband's death  Mrs. B was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""".  Treatment and Outcome:  Mrs. B was managed conservatively in the coronary care unit with continued monitoring. She was treated with heart failure medications including Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  Beta blockers  Diuretics  and Anticoagulants to prevent blood clotting. Her chest pain and ST-segment elevations resolved over the next few days. In follow-up echocardiography taken eight weeks after the initial event  Mrs. B's heart function was found to have returned to normal with an efficient ejection fraction.  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a relatively rare  acute heart condition  often triggered by severe emotional stress. The condition is more common in post-menopausal women. Although the long-term prognosis is generally good with most patients making a full recovery  acute management in a hospital setting is often needed due to the severity of the initial symptoms which may mimic a heart attack.

15,7,62,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial62,Case Report:  A 60-year-old Caucasian Female with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following the Loss of Her Son  Patient Information: A 60-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of a heart attack including sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  shortness of breath  and extreme fatigue. She was recently bereaved following the loss of her only son in a car accident two weeks ago.   Medical History: Mrs. X has a past medical history significant for hypertension controlled with amlodipine  hypothyroidism managed with thyroxine  and chronic back pain. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. There is no family history of cardiac disease.  Investigations and Diagnosis: On presentation  her blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior wall  and blood tests revealed a mildly increased troponin level.   An emergency coronary angiogram was performed that did not reveal significant coronary artery stenosis typically present in myocardial infarctions. Left ventriculogram  however  showed apical ballooning with a preserved basal function - a pattern indicative of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM) or broken heart syndrome.  Considering the presenting symptoms  the event of recent severe stress (death of her son)  and the characteristic diagnostic findings confirm the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Treatment: The patient was treated conservatively with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  β-blockers and was provided psychological support for her grief. She was monitored closely in the cardiac care unit for arrhythmias  heart failure  or thrombus formation  which are common complications in the acute phase of TCM.   Outcome and Follow-Up: The patient responded well to therapy. Follow-up echocardiography after two months showed complete resolution of the ventricular dysfunction. At six months follow-up  Mrs. X was considerably better and displayed no signs of chest discomfort  fatigue  or breathlessness.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of considering Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in patients presenting with acute chest pain and relevant triggers  especially in postmenopausal women. Despite a presentation similar to a heart attack  the absence of coronary artery blockage and the presence of apical ballooning are characteristic findings. Though TCM is often triggered by severe emotional stress  it is ordinarily transient and reversible with appropriate management.
15,7,63,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial63,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 56-year-old Female After an Emotional Triggering Event  Patient Demographics The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian female  employed as a financial manager and neither a smoker nor an alcohol drinker. She is a widow with two grown-up children.  Presenting Complaints The patient presented to the ER with severe central chest pain radiating to her left arm and neck  associated with shortness of breath  nausea  sweating  and a feeling of impending doom.   Medical History The patient had a past medical history of hypertension  diagnosed three years ago  for which she took Amlodipine 10mg daily. There was no past history of ischemic heart disease  diabetes mellitus  dyslipidemia  or any psychiatric disorders. The patient did not have any known allergies.  Recent Events and Triggers The patient recently lost her husband from a sudden cardiac event  and the anniversary of his death had occurred earlier in the week  causing intense emotional distress.  Clinical Findings On examination  the patient was anxious and perspiring with a heart rate of 110 bpm  blood pressure of 150/100mm/Hg  respiration rate of 18 breaths per min  and oxygen saturation was 94% at room air. 12 lead ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II  III  AVF  V4-V6.  Investigations and Results Lab reports showed normal complete blood count  renal function  and electrolytes. Cardiac troponin I levels were elevated (1.0ng/mL  normal: <0.04ng/mL). Lipid profile was within normal limits. A chest X-ray was normal. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed impaired left ventricular function with apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesis  suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries  ruling out acute coronary syndrome.  Treatment She was admitted to the cardiac care unit and treated with aspirin  bisoprolol  ACE inhibitors  and supportive care. She was referred to a grief counseling service to address the emotional triggers of her condition.  Outcome and Follow-Up The patient was discharged home after seven days of hospital stay with a significant resolution of symptoms  and she was put on regular follow-up. At a three-month follow-up  she reported minimal symptoms and repeat echocardiogram showed a significant improvement in left ventricular function.  Learning Point This case underlines that stressful emotional events can lead to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy even in the absence of prior ischemic heart disease. Timely intervention  both medical and psychological  can lead to a good prognosis.
15,7,64,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial64,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following Emotional Stress in Elderly Female: A Case Report  1. Patient Information  Mrs. A is an 80-year-old Caucasian female  retired schoolteacher  non-smoker  from a non-alcoholic background. She is widowed with two children and lives alone. She has no known family history of heart diseases. She was actively involved in community service and yoga.   2. Clinical Findings   Mrs. A reported to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath following the sudden tragic death of her only grandson in a road accident. On examination  she was pale  mildly diaphoretic with a heart rate of 110 beats/min and blood pressure measurement of 150/80 mm Hg. She had no prior history of heart disease or hypertension. The cardiovascular examination revealed no murmurs  rubs or gallops and the lungs were clear on auscultation.  3. Timeline  The symptoms started suddenly within 2 hours following the traumatic news. On examination  she had signs suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior and lateral leads. High-sensitivity troponin-I levels were elevated  which made the clinical picture suspicious of an acute myocardial infarction.   4. Diagnostic Focus and Assessment  The patient was immediately sent for emergent coronary angiography which surprisingly showed no significant documented arteriosclerotic changes or obstruction. A bedside transthoracic echocardiography revealed left ventricular apical ballooning with hypercontractility at the base of heart  a characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome). Given the patient's presentation  the clinical diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made.  5. Therapeutic Focus and Assessment  The initial acute management was a standard treatment for acute coronary syndrome  including aspirin  clopidogrel  and heparin. Once the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was suspected based on the angiogram and confirmed by the echo  the heparin was discontinued. The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit and treated with supportive care  including beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.   6. Follow-up and Outcomes  The patient's chest pain and shortness of breath significantly improved over the following days. A repeat echocardiogram performed seven days later showed complete resolution of the left ventricular dysfunction. The patient was discharged 10 days later on a regimen of Aspirin  beta-blocker  and ACE inhibitor. She underwent regular follow up for the next three months with echocardiogram showing normal left ventricular function and overall improvement in her health status.  7. Patient Perspective   “Losing my grandson was unimaginable for me. The heartache was so intense  I could feel it physically. Following my doctors' advice  I have now joined a bereavement group and continue to participate in community activities to keep myself engaged”  said Mrs. A.  8. Teaching Points   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be considered as a differential diagnosis in elderly females presenting with acute coronary syndrome  especially in contexts involving intense emotional stress. Confirmatory diagnosis is made by coronary angiography and echocardiography revealing characteristic apical ballooning. Timely recognition and management of this potentially reversible condition can lead to a good prognosis.
15,7,65,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial65,Title: Acute Stress-Induced (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy in an Elderly Female  Case Report:  Identification Information & Chief Complaint: The patient is an 82-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher  who presented to the emergency department complaining of acute onset of severe chest pain.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and depression  all of which are well-controlled with medication. She has been on atenolol  atorvastatin  and escitalopram for several years. The patient has no prior history of coronary artery disease  myocardial infarction  heart failure  or other cardiovascular diseases. She does not smoke but admits to moderate alcohol consumption. She has been living alone since her husband passed away 2 years ago.  Clinical Findings: Upon presentation  the patient was experiencing classic angina-like symptoms  including chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Physical examination revealed mild tachycardia and moderate hypertension. No heart murmurs  rubs  gallops  or arrhythmias were noted.  Diagnostic Assessment: Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated prominent T wave inversions in the precordial leads  suggesting acute coronary syndrome. However  coronary angiography revealed no significant blockages. Echocardiogram however showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal walls - features characteristic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the cardiac care unit for observation and management. Treatment was mainly supportive  including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics to lessen cardiac load. She showed gradual improvement in symptoms and the scheduled follow-up echocardiograpy revealed resolution of the apical ballooning.  Discussion: The patient's symptoms  the absence of significant coronary artery disease on angiography along with the echocardiographic features  were consistent with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM). TCM often presents with symptoms similar to acute coronary syndrome  particularly after a recent stressful event. In this case  the patient  living alone  might have been subjected to chronic emotional stress  possibly triggering TCM.  This case emphasizes the significance of understanding TCM as a differential diagnosis in elderly females presenting with chest pain  especially when other significant cardiac disease is absent. It also supports the necessity of treating TCM with a supportive approach  primarily focused on reducing cardiac work and reassessing with regular cardiac imaging.  Follow-Up: The patient has been advised to continue medical management for her hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and depression. She is scheduled to return for regular follow-ups and an ongoing evaluation of her cardiac status. As part of managing stress levels  the patient has also been recommended to engage in group therapy  yoga  or meditation  after discharge. 
15,7,66,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial66,Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 66-year-old Female with a History of Depression  Patient Profile:  - Age: 66 - Sex: Female - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired teacher  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented to the Emergency Department with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  shortness of breath  palpitations  sweating  and nausea. Symptoms began abruptly approximately two hours prior to her arrival.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of chronic depression for which she has been receiving psychotherapy and medication (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRI). The patient's other medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidaemia  which are well controlled with medication (ACE inhibitor and statin  respectively). The patient has never smoked and has no history of illicit drug use. She does not have any family history of cardiac diseases but has a family history of depression and suicide.  Assessment and Findings:  On physical examination  the patient appeared to be in obvious distress. She was conscious but visibly anxious and sweating profusely. Auscultation revealed normal heart sounds but also signs of slight pulmonary congestion. Her blood pressure was 165/95 mmHg  heart rate was 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation level was 96% on room air.  Lab tests indicated raised cardiac enzymes levels  Troponin T - 0.223 ng/mL (reference range <0.01 ng/mL) and Creatine Kinase-MB - 45 U/L (reference range < 25 U/L). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior lead  mimicking an anterior wall myocardial infarction.  Diagnosis:  Given the patient's symptoms  medical history and initial test results  a presumptive diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) was made  and she was moved to the Cardiac Care Unit for further evaluation.  A Coronary Angiography was performed to rule out Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)  and surprisingly  no significant stenosis was observed. Meanwhile  an Echocardiogram showed severe hypokinesis of the apical segments with hyperkinesis of the basal segments - a pattern known as apical ballooning.  Considering the patient's recent history of emotional stress  the angiographic and echocardiographic findings  a final diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM) was made.  Treatment and Outcome:  The patient was started on beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors and was continued on her regular dose of SSRI for depression. She was under continuous monitorization in the intensification care unit. She received psychological support during her hospital stay  considering the importance of emotional factors in TCM.  Her clinical condition improved gradually over the next week  and she was discharged with advice on lifestyle modifications for controlling stress and hypertension. Close follow-ups were scheduled with Cardiology and Psychiatry for the effective management of TCM and depression.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of considering TCM in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chest pain  particularly in postmenopausal women with recent emotional stress. The case also reinforces the importance of considering psychiatric comorbidities such as depression.   Patient consent was obtained for the write-up and publication of this case.

This case report presents a 67-year-old female with this syndrome.  Presenting complaints: A 67-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain that started suddenly after she received the news of the unexpected death of her close friend. She also reported shortness of breath.  History of Present Illness: The pain was intense  centered in the chest  lasting for about 2 hours. Associated symptoms included dyspnea  anxiety  and diaphoresis. She denied any associated nausea  vomiting or radiating discomfort.  Past Medical and Personal History: Her prior medical history revealed controlled hypertension managed on Losartan and no history of previous cardiac issues. Despite her age  she was quite active and had a history of occasional tobacco use but quit 15 years ago. She lived independently and had a history of mild depression  for which she was not taking any medication.  Clinical Findings: Initial examination showed that the patient was diaphoretic  had a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  pulse rate of 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed tachycardia with regular rhythm and no murmur  rub  or gallop were auscultated.  Investigations: Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4  but the patient’s serum troponin level was normal. Further diagnostic testing included a coronary angiogram which revealed no evidence of a significant blockage in any coronary arteries  ruling out a conventional heart attack. However  the left ventriculogram showed apical ballooning  indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment: The patient was managed conservatively with beta-blockers (metoprolol)  ACE inhibitors  and was provided supportive care including reassurance  frequent monitoring  and psychological support.  Outcome and Follow-up: Her chest pain resolved within a few days  and she was discharged on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors as standard therapy. On her follow-up appointment 2 months later  an echocardiogram showed complete resolution of left ventricular function  confirming the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She reported feeling much better  with no recurrence of her chest pain or any other associated symptoms.  Learning Points: This case underscores the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with severe chest pain  particularly following an emotional stressor. This syndrome is likely underdiagnosed as it mimics myocardial infarction  yet can be differentiated by specific EKG changes  the absence of obstructive coronary disease  and the presence of apical ballooning on ventriculography.

15,7,68,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial68,Patient Case Report  Patient Information:  Ms. X  65-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher  residing in Ontario  Canada. She presented to the local emergency department with central chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient is widowed and lives alone  she has two adult children who reside in different cities. She was previously active  smoked for 20 years  but quitted 15 years ago. There’s a family history of cardiovascular disease – her father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 69.  Past Medical History:  Ms. X reported that she has been managing hypertension and hypothyroidism for the past 5 years and has been generally compliant with prescribed medications – Metoprolol and Levothyroxine respectively. No past episodes of chest pain have been reported. Three weeks ago  she lost her younger brother to cancer which was a stressful life event.  Present Illness:  The patient’s symptoms started a few hours before presentation  the pain was described as intense and pressing  radiating to the left arm  associated with bouts of acute breathlessness. Electrocardiogram (EKG) indicated ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads suggesting an acute coronary syndrome.   Management:  She was immediately treated with dual antiplatelet therapy  statins  and nitroglycerin as per acute coronary syndrome protocol. Echocardiography was performed and showed hyperkinesis of the basal segments and akinesis of the mid to apical segments of the left ventricle  classic for takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiogram revealed minimal coronary artery disease excluding the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Cardiac biomarkers were slightly elevated.  Diagnosis:  Based on these findings  Ms. X was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome)  which is typically precipitated by acute severe emotional stress.   Treatment:  She was managed conservatively  and her chest pain symptoms resolved over the subsequent 48 hours. Repeat echocardiography after three weeks confirmed a complete recovery of the left ventricular function.  Prognosis:  She was educated about the condition and reassured about the generally benign nature of the condition with good prognosis and low recurrence rate. She was however advised to adopt stress-coping strategies to avoid a recurrence of similar episodes in the future. The patient agreed to lifestyle modifications and follow-up in the outpatient department for further monitoring and management of her hypertension.
15,7,69,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial69,"Patient Information:   Ms. R  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presented herself to the emergency department on August 5  2021.  Chief Complaint:   Complaints of sudden-onset chest pain and shortness of breath.  History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and type two diabetes mellitus  well controlled with proper medication for the past 12 years. She also suffered from informative breast cancer  for which she underwent surgical intervention in the form of a mastectomy five years ago  followed by a successful course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She is a non-smoker  with moderate alcohol consumption. Prior to her breast cancer  she was healthy and had an active lifestyle. She lives with her cat and has a strong social network with supportive friends and family.   Present Illness:  The patient reported waking up at night due to severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. Described the pain as a """"heavy pressure"""". The chest pain was accompanied by shortness of breath  cold sweating  and palpitations. It started suddenly without any warning. The patient reported no known triggers but she has been under significant emotional stress  owing to her recent divorce.  She was immediately rushed to the hospital  arriving approximately 2 hours after symptom onset.   Physical Examination:  On physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and was in visible pain. Blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  pulse rate 110 beats/min  respiratory rate 20 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Investigations:  Blood tests showed elevated troponin level. ECG indicated ST elevation in precordial leads. Coronary angiography was performed which showed no significant stenosis or occlusion to suggest acute coronary syndrome.  Echocardiogram demonstrated apical ballooning and severely reduced left ventricular function  with an estimated ejection fraction of 30%. This  along with the patient's presentation and diagnostic findings  led to the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or “broken heart syndrome.”  Treatment:  Patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit where she was treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  β-blockers  and diuretics.   Outcome:  The patient responded well to medical management. Her symptoms significantly improved after 3 days and by the 7th day  a repeat echocardiogram showed significant recovery of left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 55%.   The patient was discharged after two weeks with instruction to continue her medications and follow a routine outpatient check-up after one month.  Interpretation:  This case report underscores the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain  especially in post-menopausal women and in the setting of recent emotional stress  despite the high prevalence of coronary artery disease in this population."
15,7,70,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial70,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 70-Year-Old Woman Following Emotional Stress: A Case Report  Patient Information:  A 70-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the emergency department (ED) of our hospital.  Chief Complaint: The patient presented to the ED complaining of sudden onset severe chest pain  similar in character to that of myocardial infarction.  Past Medical History: The patient had a history of hypertension and hyperthyroidism. She had no prior history of ischemic heart disease  arrhythmia  or drug allergies.  Recent Events: In the interview  it was noted that the patient experienced a severe emotional upset. She had just attended her husband's funeral the previous day  which was an extremely stressful event for her.  Clinical Findings: The initial physical examination revealed an anxious and diaphoretic woman with tachycardia  blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  and slight respiratory difficulty. The 12-lead ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II  III  aVF  and V3-6  suggesting an acute coronary syndrome.   Diagnostic Assessment: Blood chemistry showed raised troponin levels. The subsequent coronary angiography revealed unobstructed coronary arteries  but the left ventriculogram displayed apical ballooning with preserved function at the base of the heart.   The presentation of symptoms following emotional stress  the ECG changes  elevated troponin levels  and characteristic imaging findings lead to a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  a transient cardiac syndrome that mimics myocardial infarction.  Therapeutic Intervention: Treatment was supportive  with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  aspirin  and diuretics combined with close cardiac monitoring.  Follow Up and Outcomes: The patient's ECG abnormalities and cardiac symptoms improved greatly over six weeks. The follow-up echocardiogram showed complete normalization of the left ventricular function  confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of physicians being mindful of TTC as a potential differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain  particularly when following emotional stress  despite ECG changes and biomarkers suggesting acute coronary syndrome.

15,7,71,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial71,"Title: An Uncommon Presentation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 56-Year-Old Woman  Case Report  Patient Information: A 56-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with severe retrosternal chest discomfort. The pain started suddenly while she was performing her daily chores. Pain radiated to the left arm and was associated with shortness of breath. No associated loss of consciousness  palpitations  or diaphoresis reported. The patient had a history of hypertension controlled with beta-blocker therapy and no history of diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  or thyroid disorders. There were no previous hospitalizations. She was a nonsmoker and denied alcohol consumption. The patient was recently widowed a few months ago.  Clinical Findings: On initial examination  the patient was pallid  acutely ill-looking  saturating 96% on room air. Pulse rate was 92 beats per minute  blood pressure was 148/98 mm Hg  and respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds and no murmurs. Lung bases were clear to auscultation.  Diagnostic Assessment: The electrocardiogram at presentation showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads V1-V4. Initial laboratory investigations  including complete blood count  renal function test  and liver function test  were within normal limits. The initial troponin T level was 0.51 ng/mL (normal: <0.01 ng/mL). The patient was treated as an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) case and transferred to the cardiac catheterization lab. Coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis. Left ventriculogram demonstrated akinesia of the apex with basal hyperkinesis  consistent with """"Takotsubo"""" or """"apical ballooning"""" pattern. Echocardiography confirmed these findings.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was managed by supportive care including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers. The anticoagulant was discontinued considering the possibility of intraventricular thrombus. Antidepressants were also prescribed to manage the stress related to loss.   Follow-up and Outcomes: During the hospital stay  the patient’s symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea improved. Serial cardiac biomarkers returned to normal within a week. Repeat echocardiography after four weeks demonstrated near normalization of left ventricular function. Clinically  the patient remained symptom-free at the 3-month follow-up.  Patient's Perspective: The patient’s sense of well-being had improved significantly  and she was relieved that her coronary arteries were normal. She was introduced to a local bereavement support group  which she found helpful.  Informed Consent: The patient gave informed consent for the case to be published.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain  especially in postmenopausal women with recent severe emotional stress. Also  a normal coronary anatomy during angiography in the setting of myocardial infarction should raise the suspicion for the same. Prompt recognition and supportive treatment can significantly improve outcomes."
15,7,72,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial72,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Female with No Previous Cardiovascular History  Case Report:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female with an unremarkable medical history  other than controlled Hypothyroidism on Levothyroxine  who presented at our emergency department with severe chest pain. She had not been experiencing any previous symptoms  did not have any known cardiovascular history  and did not take any regular cardiovascular medication.  Five days before her admission  the patient had faced a severe emotional stress in the form of her husband's sudden death. She reported gapingly awakened from sleep with sudden  severe  and central chest pain radiating to her left arm. Her chest pain was reported as 9/10 on the Visual Analogue Scale and was associated with nausea  diaphoresis  and breathlessness.   Clinical examination revealed slightly elevated blood pressure at 140/90mmHg and a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. The rest of the physical findings were normal. The patient had an ECG  which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. She was immediately admitted for suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome and started on Asprin and Clopidogrel.  Laboratory investigations did not show significantly elevated Troponin T levels. Echocardiography showed akinetic apical and middle segments of the left ventricle with hyperkinetic basal segments  often compared to the shape of a takotsubo (Octopus trap). Coronary angiography did not show any significant coronary artery disease that could explain the regional wall motion abnormality.  The diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made clinically using the Mayo clinic criteria. She was initiated on standard heart failure treatment with Bisoprolol and Ramipril. Psychotherapy was also advised considering her emotional stress.  The patient demonstrated a gradual clinical improvement and was discharged after eight days. Follow-up echocardiography done six weeks later showed marked improvement and near-normalization of the left ventricular function.  Conclusion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress or broken heart syndrome  can mimic myocardial infarction and is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. This report highlights that the syndrome  while rare  may occur in people with no previous cardiovascular history. Hence  it is vital to include Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in individuals presenting with chest pain and electrocardiogram changes  regardless of their previous history. Additionally  psychological support might be beneficial in the management of this condition given its strong correlation with stressful events. 
15,7,73,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial73,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following Extreme Emotional Stress in a Postmenopausal Woman  Case Report:  The patient  Ms. A  is a 68-year-old Caucasian female with a history of depression and anxiety  but no known history of cardiovascular disease. She was in her usual state of health until the untimely passing of her son  which served as the situational stressor that exacerbated her condition.   She presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to her left shoulder  associated with difficulty in breathing  palpitations  and an episode of syncope that lasted approximately 2 minutes. The pain had started suddenly  around 2 hours after hearing the news of her son's death. She described the pain as a heavy pressure  scoring it as a 9 on the scale of 1 to 10  with 10 being the most severe pain.  She had a pulse rate of 102 beats per minute  blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% in room air. The rest of her physical examination was within normal limits.  Histories related to alcohol consumption  smoking  or illicit drug use were negative. She was on escitalopram for her depression and lorazepam for anxiety.  Her preliminary blood work revealed elevated troponin levels at 4 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL)  with normal CK-MB levels. EKG showed ST-segment elevations in leads II  III  aVF  and V1-V4. Following the results  she was immediately transferred for coronary angiography suspecting an acute myocardial infraction. Surprisingly  the angiography did not reveal any coronary artery disease.  Echocardiography revealed apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesis  clinical features consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). Her left ventricular ejection fraction was also markedly reduced at 35% (normal >55%). She was diagnosed with TTC following confirmation from the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that displayed transient regional systolic dysfunction of the left ventricular (LV) mid-segments with or without apical involvement  mimicking the image of the “octopus trap”  which is the hallmark of TTC.  Ms. A was given supportive care with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and anxiolytics. She was also recommended for counseling considering her grief response to her son's passing. By the end of the second week  her troponin levels normalized and her chest pain resolved  with a remarkable improvement in the echocardiography depicting the ejection fraction returning to the normal value.   This case report presents the characteristic triggers  and presentation of TTC  and how effective management with supportive care can lead to complete recovery. It is crucial for healthcare providers to consider TTC in the differential diagnosis when older women present with chest pain and EKG changes following intense emotional stress even in the absence of coronary artery disease.
15,7,74,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial74,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Female: A Case Report  Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'  is a transient  acute heart condition often precipitated by severe emotional or physical stress. The syndrome is characterized by a sudden  temporary weakening of the myocardium.  Patient Information: A 56-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe chest pain radiating down her left arm. She reported the onset of pain suddenly in the early morning hours. She is currently post-menopausal and works as an elementary school teacher  living a previously sedentary lifestyle.  Clinical Findings: On examination  she was diaphoretic and complained of dyspnea. Blood pressure was 155/95 mmHg  heart rate was 110 beats/min  respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. She rated her pain as 8/10.  Diagnostic Assessment: Her ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads along with a mildly increased troponin level  raising concerns for acute myocardial infarction (MI). The patient was immediately transferred to Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) for further evaluation where angiography revealed no significant stenosis in the coronary arteries but revealed the typical 'apical ballooning' associated with TTC.  Her echocardiogram confirmed left ventricular apical ballooning dysfunction with a slightly depressed ejection fraction (40%).  The patient reported the recent loss of her husband  indicating a significant emotional stress trigger  which is known to be associated with TTC.  Therapeutic Interventions: The patient was initially managed as an acute MI with dual antiplatelet therapy  beta-blocker  ACE inhibitor  and statins. After confirmatory diagnosis of TTC  cautious volume repletion was done to improve left ventricular function. Progress was carefully monitored through serial echocardiography. Psychological support was provided for her bereavement.  Follow up and Outcome:  Upon discharge a week later  repeat echocardiogram showed improvement in ejection fraction and resolution of ventricular wall motion abnormalities. She was enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program. Outpatient follow-up after 3 months showed the patient was asymptomatic and her ECG returned to normal. Her cardiac function continued to remain normal in subsequent 6 and 12-month follow-ups.  Conclusion: The case emphasizes the critical importance of considering TTC in the differential diagnosis of post-menopausal women presenting with chest pain  especially in those undergoing significant emotional stress. Though transient  it can cause severe heart failure  and hence timely diagnosis and treatment are essential.
15,7,75,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial75,"Title: A Case Report of a Middle-Aged Woman with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Abstract: We report a case of a 55-year-old female non-smoker patient diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a syndrome characterized by transient regional systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle. Highlighting the clinical presentation  diagnostic steps  and management plan  this case emphasizes the importance of a high index of suspicion and a comprehensive approach to a differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.  Case Presentation:  A 55-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension and borderline diabetes presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of severe chest pain. The pain started abruptly during a stressful argument and was described as a squeezing sensation radiating to her jaw and left arm  intensifying over the span of an hour. She had no history of drug abuse or psychotropic medication use. Further family history did not show any incidence of cardiac disease.  Vitals upon arrival in the ED included a blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 24 per minute  and oxygen saturation of 97% in room air. Physical examination was significant for diaphoresis and distress due to pain but otherwise unremarkable.   Diagnostic Assessment:  Initial EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  indicating acute coronary syndrome. Lab findings included elevated troponin levels at 5 ng/mL. However  the patient's hypertension and diabetes status warranted a further diagnostic approach. An echocardiogram was performed that revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved function of the basal segments  more suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Cardiac catheterization revealed no obstructive coronary artery disease  further confirming the diagnosis.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Management included the initiation of aspirin  low molecular weight heparin  a beta-blocker (carvedilol)  an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril)  and a statin (atorvastatin)  along with regular monitoring and conservative measures for managing chest pain. Her blood glucose levels were managed with metformin.  The patient's course in the hospital remained stable  and her chest pain significantly improved after 48 hours.  Follow up and Outcome:  A repeat echocardiogram performed 8 weeks later revealed normalization of the left ventricular systolic function. The patient was then advised to continue the medical therapy and follow up in the outpatient department regularly.  Conclusion:  This case merits attention as it presents an instance where Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" was initially mistaken for acute coronary syndrome due to similar clinical manifestations. Hence  the typical characteristics of this syndrome should be recognized promptly for appropriate diagnosis and management  primarily when the patient's history includes recent high-stress levels."
15,7,76,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial76,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman  Patient Information  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female. She is a non-smoker  lives alone  and is widowed. The patient denies any use of alcohol or illicit drugs. She is a retired grade school teacher and has a past medical history of hyperlipidemia  with no known drug allergies. She has a family history of coronary artery disease  with both her parents passing away due to heart conditions in their early 70s.  Clinical Findings  The patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with severe chest pain radiating down her left arm  associated with shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and overwhelming anxiety. The patient reported the symptoms started suddenly while she was under severe emotional distress following a heated argument with a family member. She has never experienced such symptoms before. The severity of the pain was an 8 out of 10 on the pain scale.   Diagnostic Assessment   Electrocardiogram (EKG) at the ED revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Initial high-sensitive troponin levels were significantly elevated  with a reading of 0.38 ng/mL. The patient was emergently treated as per ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) protocol and taken for coronary angiography. Interestingly  coronary angiography showed no significant atherosclerotic disease.  An echocardiogram was performed  revealing apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal segments  which are typical features of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Ejection fraction was measured to be 35%. Given her clinical presentation and these findings  the patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was initially managed with aspirin  clopidogrel  atorvastatin  and enoxaparin in line with acute coronary syndrome protocol. After the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was confirmed  her management was switched to a beta-blocker (metoprolol) and ACE inhibitor (ramipril) to manage her heart failure.   Follow-up and Outcomes  The patient's chest pain and dyspnea gradually improved over a few days. Repeat echocardiogram performed after a week showed slight improvement in left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 45%. The patient was discharged on the tenth day with prescriptions for metoprolol and ramipril.  The patient was educated on the condition  the need for follow-up  and optimization of lifestyle changes including stress management techniques. The patient was followed up in the cardiology clinic after two weeks. Her medications were continued  and she was enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program. She has since remained symptom free during her regular follow-up visits. Repeat echocardiogram after three months showed normalization of left ventricular function.  Patient Perspective  The patient expressed initial shock and difficulty accepting the diagnosis. Considering her family history of heart disease  she initially believed she was having a heart attack. However  after her physicians thoroughly explained Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  she felt relieved. Despite her improvement  she remained worried about potential recurrence. As part of her recovery  she has since engaged in psychotherapy for stress management and continues to focus on implementing healthier lifestyle habits.

15,7,77,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial77,Patient Information:   A 67-year-old Caucasian female presented to our emergency department complaining of sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. She lives alone and has no known close relatives. According to her neighbours  she is known to be highly independent and socially active person in her locality. The patient was a retired college professor and had lost her only son in a car accident two years ago. Past medical history is significant for mild hypertension and anxiety disorder  for which she is on enalapril 10mg and escitalopram 10mg respectively. She neither used tobacco nor consumed alcohol.  Clinical Presentation:   On arrival at the hospital  she was anxious and stated that she had been feeling a tightening sensation across her chest and difficulty in breathing since morning. On examination  her blood pressure was 170/100mmHg and heart rate was 110 beats per minute. Pulse oximetry indicated o2 saturation of 95% on room air. Chest examination revealed no abnormal lung sounds.  Investigations:   Diagnostic investigations included electrocardiography (ECG) which showed ST-segment elevation highly suggesting acute myocardial injury. Her blood tests returned positive for elevated troponin I levels. Toluidine blue staining revealed no signs of clot formation. Due to her unstable condition  she was immediately transferred to the catheterization lab for coronary angiography. Surprisingly  this revealed the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Further testing using transthoracic echocardiography revealed a significant reduction in systolic function of the left ventricle and apical ballooning  a pathognomonic sign of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Diagnosis and Management:   The diagnosis of TCM was made based on the clinical presentation  echocardiography findings  and absence of significant coronary artery disease. The patient was started on a beta-blocker (metoprolol)  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril)  and a diuretic (furosemide) to manage her symptoms and cardiac function. She was provided supportive care  and her condition was closely monitored.  Outcome and prognostic considerations:  Over the next several days  the patient's health gradually improved. Her chest pain and shortness of breath were ameliorated. Follow-up echocardiography was done within a week displayed significant recovery of the left ventricular function with no observable apical ballooning. She was discharged home with an outpatient follow-up appointment. For the long-term management of her condition  she was advised to continue with the prescribed medication and regular follow-ups. The patient was also recommended to meet a mental health professional considering the association of TCM with emotional stress.   Due to the nature of TCM  it is crucial for healthcare professionals to recognize and assess high-stress situations or emotional trauma in patients  as they can contribute to a sudden collapse in left ventricular function leading to heart failure symptoms.
15,7,78,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial78,Title: A Rare Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 65-year-old Male Following the Loss of a Spouse   Patient Description:   Mr. JS is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired teacher  who presented to the hospital with complaints of severe chest pain  sweating  and shortness of breath. The patient lives alone and recently lost his wife after 40 years of marriage.   Past Medical History:   In terms of past medical history  the patient has been generally healthy with no rigorous medical incidents. The only significant history is mild hypertension which has been well-managed with routine medications and quarterly visits to his healthcare provider.  Clinical Findings:   Upon physical examination  the patient had an elevated heart rate (tachycardia) and high blood pressure. His breathing rate was also slightly increased. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST-segment elevation  initially suspicious for myocardial infarction. However  subsequent blood tests showed modestly raised troponin levels  not characteristic of a typical heart attack.   Diagnostic Assessment:   Given the presentation of symptoms  it was initially suspected that the patient may have experienced a heart attack. However  a coronary angiogram revealed no significant blockages of coronary arteries to account for the symptoms  which pointed us to potentially differential diagnoses. The patient then underwent an echocardiogram which displayed apical ballooning of the left ventricle  a classic sign seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome).   Therapeutic Intervention:   The patient was admitted for observation and was given supportive therapy including beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and aspirin to manage his symptoms and protect his heart. He showed improved functioning and decreasing levels of cardiac enzymes over the following days.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:   Follow-up after four weeks  showed a marked improvement in the patient's condition  with the patient reporting a decrease in chest pains and increase in overall well-being. A repeat echocardiogram demonstrated that the left ventricular function had returned to normal without any residual cardiac sequelae.  Patient Perspective:   The patient acknowledged the emotional stress he had been experiencing for losing his wife and post-diagnosis reported being more receptive to seeking and accepting support and counselling to deal with this life-altering event.  Learning Points:   This case highlights the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain  especially in the context of recent severe emotional stress. As always  a comprehensive and considerate approach proves pivotal in providing quality patient care.
15,7,79,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial79,Patient Information:   A 65-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the hospital after experiencing sudden  sharp chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain eased at rest but was exacerbated by physical exertion. She presented with a history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and depression. She was a non-smoker and consumed alcohol moderately. She lived on her own and was independent in her daily activities. She did not have any known allergies. Following her husband's death 2 months ago  she had been under significant emotional stress.   Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  the patient appeared mildly distressed  sweating  and pale. Her blood pressure was 150/95 mmHg and pulse rate was 110 per minute. She exhibited significant anxiety and laboured breathing. Her physical examination was otherwise unremarkable  with no noticeable peripheral edema  jugular venous distension  or abnormal heart sounds.  Diagnosis:  Blood work showed moderately elevated cardiac troponin I levels (1.8 ng/mL)  and an electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. An emergent angiogram showed no significant stenosis (blockage) in the coronary arteries  which led to a suspicion of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC). Further diagnostic testing with echocardiography showed apical akinesia with basal hyperkinesis of the left ventricle which confirmed the diagnosis of TC.   Treatment:  The patient was initially managed with pain control and fluid resuscitation. She was started on beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and anticoagulants. After diagnosis  she was further treated with a low-salt diet and advised on stress management techniques. A psychologist was consulted to manage her ongoing depression and bereavement issues.  Outcome and Follow-up:  After an initial period of intensive cardiac monitoring in the hospital  the patient steadily improved over the next two weeks and her troponin levels returned to normal. A follow-up echocardiogram a month later showed a significant improvement in left ventricular function. The patient was recommended lifestyle modifications and close follow-up with cardiology and psychiatry services. She was advised to continue her medication  engage in mild physical activities  and seek grief counseling to alleviate emotional stress. Her prognosis was discussed  and she was counseled regarding the possibility of recurrence.   Patient Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publishing this case report. All patient identifiers have been removed or altered to maintain privacy.   Learning Points:  This case emphasizes the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis when older patients  particularly women  present with chest pain and EKG changes  especially in the context of significant emotional stressors. It also highlights the role of mental health in the onset and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases.

Past Medical History: This patient has a history of moderate hypertension controlled with medication (hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily) and has no known allergies. There is no past medical history of diabetes  coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular conditions. However  she does have a family history of coronary artery disease  with both her parents experiencing myocardial infarctions in their late sixties.  She did have a diagnostic workup done approx. five years ago due to chest pain  but was found to have no signs of significant stenosis or ischemia and her lipids levels were within normal limits. Also  as she reports  she visits her doctor annually for routine checkups.  Presenting Concerns: The patient was admitted to the hospital following chest pain  palpitations  diaphoresis  and sudden shortness of breath following her house burglary confrontation. EKG revealed non-specific ST-segment and T wave abnormalities  indicating possible myocardial injury or early ischemia. Cardiac biomarkers were also elevated with Troponin I levels at 1.4 ng/mL (reference range 0–0.04 ng/mL) and B-type Natriuretic peptide at 690 pg/mL (reference range 0-100 pg/mL).   Based on these findings  an emergent coronary angiogram was performed to rule out acute coronary syndrome  which did not reveal any significant coronary artery disease but did show a left ventricular mid-apical ballooning characteristic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her ejection fraction was found to be 30% (normal range being 55-70%).  Management and Outcome: The patient received standard heart failure medication including beta-blockers (metoprolol)  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (lisinopril)  and diuretics (furosemide). She was closely monitored in the hospital. After a week  repeat echocardiogram showed recovery of her left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 55%.  Her follow-up appointments have been uneventful  and she is coping better with her emotional stresses  with the aid of psychotherapy and a local support group  in addition to attending a cardiac rehabilitation program.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of recognizing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with chest pain  particularly in the setting of emotional stressors. Although typically reversible  prompt recognition and treatment are crucial for these patients.
15,7,81,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial81,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 57-year-old Female  Patient Information:  A 57-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient  a resident of Asheville  North Carolina  is a retired school teacher  widow  non-smoker  and drinker of approximately 10 units of alcohol per week.  Background and Medical History:  The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is currently taking Lisinopril  simvastatin  and metformin respectively for these conditions. Additional history revealed that her husband passed away six months prior to this presentation following a prolonged illness. The patient has been under significant psychosocial stress since then.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient was in acute distress  with blood pressure of 170/95 mm Hg  heart rate at 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate at 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. She had diffuse ST segment elevation on the initial EKG. Laboratory results showed normal complete blood count  but an elevated cardiac troponin I level at 2.6 ng/mL.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  Given the EKG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes  initial suspicion was for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)  and the patient was urgently taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. However  the coronary angiography demonstrated no significant obstructions in the coronary arteries.  Subsequent left ventriculography demonstrated the classic ‘octopus pot’ or 'takotsubo' appearance with apical ballooning and basal hypercontraction of the left ventricle  suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM). This was further confirmed by echocardiography.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment:  The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and treated with aspirin  intravenously administered nitroglycerin  and a beta-blocker. Her symptoms completely resolved within the next 72 hours. Repeat cardiac biomarkers after 48 hours showed normalization of troponin I levels.  Conclusion:  Despite her extensive history of cardiovascular risk factors  the patient was diagnosed with TCM  commonly known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  triggered by intense emotional stress. This case underscores the importance of considering TCM in the differential diagnosis of chest pain  especially in postmenopausal women with recent severe stress  even when classic heart attack symptoms and initial investigations suggest an acute coronary event.   Patient Follow-up:  The patient was discharged in stable condition with a follow-up in the cardiology clinic. A repeat echocardiography was scheduled for 3 months post-discharge  which demonstrated normalization of left ventricular function and wall motion abnormalities. The patient has been counselled about stress management  grief counselling and cardiac rehabilitation.

15,7,82,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial82,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman  Patient: Maria Jones Age: 68 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Weight: 68 kg Height: 165 cm  Past medical history: Hypertension  past smoker (quit 10 years ago)  mild obesity (BMI: 25 kg/m2)  no known allergies  no family history of heart disease.  The patient presented at the outpatient department with complaints of severe chest pain  dyspnea and palpitations that began suddenly. She mentioned that she was under extreme emotional stress due to the sudden death of her sister a few days prior.  An EKG test revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. However  emergency coronary angiogram showed no signs of significant narrowing or blockage in the coronary arteries  which is unusual in patients presenting with acute chest pains or symptoms of a heart attack.  Given the absence of obstructive coronary disease or plaque rupture in angiogram and taking into consideration the patient's recent history of extreme emotional stress  a provisional diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or Broken-Heart Syndrome  was considered. Echocardiogram demonstrated a markedly reduced ejection fraction with the apical ballooning and basal hypercontraction pattern typical of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  confirming the diagnosis.  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit. Treatment started with Angiotensin-converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  Beta-blockers  and diuretic medications. Emotional support was provided by a team of psychiatrists and psychotherapists to help her cope with the emotional stress related to her sister's death.  Over a period of a few days  the patient's chest pain and shortness of breath significantly improved. The patient showed remarkable progress  and her ejection fraction was significantly improved at one month follow-up. She was advised to continue the prescribed medication along with regular monitoring of her heart function.  This case emphasizes the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chest pain  especially in postmenopausal women with a recent history of severe emotional stress. Although this is typically a transient condition  it has the potential for serious complications if not recognized and managed appropriately.
15,7,83,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial83,"Case Report: A 55-Year-Old Female with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Introduction: We herein describe a case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a rare condition also known as """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Patient Information: The patient  Mrs. A  is a 55-year-old Caucasian woman who lives with her immediate family in a suburban area. She is a teacher by profession who has been retired for a couple of years.  Clinical Findings/ Diagnosis: Mrs. A presented to the emergency department with symptoms of acute chest pain and difficulty breathing  initially suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction. After substantial diagnostic testing  the patient was finally diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Detailed Assessment and Investigations: Initial vitals recorded included BP 130/80  Pulse 88  and SPO2 97%. Electrocardiograms showed ST-segment elevation in leads II  III  aVF  V5  and V6. Troponin level was elevated at 2.5 ng/mL  while complete blood count  blood glucose  and lipid profile were within normal ranges. Following the ECG  an emergency echocardiography was performed  which exhibited a typical apical ballooning but had preserved basal contractility.  Past Medical History: Mrs. A has a history of type-2 diabetes mellitus  for which she takes metformin. She is also known to manage her hypertension with a combination of hydralazine and amlodipine. No history of smoking  alcoholism  or drug abuse. Her father had a history of coronary artery disease.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU) for close monitoring. She was initially treated with a standard heart failure regime including beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and diuretics. Additionally  psychological counseling was initiated to mitigate the stress contributing to illness.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Mrs. A was cooperative and responded positively to treatment and counseling sessions for stress management. Repeat echocardiography performed after seven days showed significant improvement in left ventricular function. The patient was discharged after 10 days with a follow-up outpatient appointment.  Patient Perspective: Mrs. A expressed her relief in understanding that her condition was not as permanent as a heart attack and was manageable with de-stressing techniques  correct medication  and lifestyle changes.  Inform Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publishing this case report.  Conclusion: This case exemplifies that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  although rare  can present itself as an acute coronary syndrome. A timely and correct diagnosis is critical and can be achieved via adequate clinical  laboratory  and imaging studies. Moreover  psychological stress may be a triggering factor and therefore  potentially a critical component in the management and prognosis of the patient.  Notes for Clinician: One must consider Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a possible diagnosis in patients  especially post-menopausal women  presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome but who have no significant coronary artery disease on angiography."

15,7,86,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial86,Title: A Case Report of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Post-Menopausal Woman Following Significant Emotional Stress  Introduction: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or “broken heart syndrome”  is a reversible form of cardiomyopathy that mimics acute coronary syndrome and is often precipitated by severe emotional stress.  Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain. The patient has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and is a nonsmoker. She is a retired schoolteacher and currently living alone.  Clinical Findings: Upon presentation  the patient described her pain as severe  crushing  and retrosternal  radiating to the left arm. The vital signs showed blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.  Diagnostic Assessment: Her 12-lead EKG demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  mimicking a myocardial infarction. Cardiac biomarkers were elevated  with Troponin I level of 5.1 ng/mL (normal: <0.04 ng/ml). An emergency coronary angiogram was performed and showed non-obstructive coronary artery disease. A left ventriculography revealed apical ballooning and hypercontraction of basal segments consistent with TTC. The ejection fraction was calculated at 35%  reduced from the normal range of 55-75%.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for cardiac monitoring. She was started on a beta-blocker (metoprolol)  an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril)  and a statin (atorvastatin). Anxiolytic and antidepressant medications were prescribed to manage her significant emotional stress. She reported recently losing her spouse after a long illness.  Follow-Up and Outcome: The patient stabilized over the next few days. Repeat echocardiogram after two weeks demonstrated significant improvement in left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 55%. The patient was then discharged with outpatient follow-up.  Patient Perspective: The patient voiced a sense of relief when learning that her symptoms  although initially reminiscent of a heart attack  were due to a medical condition that generally has a good prognosis once the emotional stressors are controlled.  Conclusion: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is an important differential diagnosis in post-menopausal women presenting with chest pain and transient ST-segment elevation. It underlines the necessity of considering emotional stress as a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
15,7,87,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial87,"Title: A Case Report of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-year-old Asian Female  Patient Information:   The patient is a 68-year-old Asian female with a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with atenolol and statins for the past ten years. She is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. Her family history includes coronary artery disease in her father who died of myocardial infarction at the age of 66 and a sister diagnosed with breast cancer. She lives alone and recently lost her husband  reportedly causing significant emotional stress.  Clinical Findings:  The patient presented to the emergency department with severe  crushing retrosternal chest pain radiating to the left arm for 4 hours. She described her pain as 8/10  triggered by a sudden emotional surge due to the anniversary of her husband’s death. She had associated symptoms of nausea  diaphoresis  and shortness of breath but denied any history of similar episodes in the past. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  and respiratory rate of 24/min. She looked distressed with pallor.  Diagnostic Assessment:  ECG showed ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads V2-V4 with QT interval prolongation. Troponin I level was elevated  suggestive of myocardial necrosis. Considering her chest pain and ECG changes  she was initially thought to have ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)  and was started on aspirin  clopidogrel and heparin. However  a coronary angiogram revealed no evidence of coronary artery disease  which made the diagnosis of STEMI unlikely.  Further investigation with transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a characteristic finding resembling a """"takotsubo""""  i.e.  apical ballooning with hypercontractile basal segment  consistent with the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Initial management included pain control with morphine and limitation of infarct size with oxygen  aspirin  clopidogrel  and heparin. Upon confirmation of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  the patient was closely monitored in the cardiology intensive care unit. ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker (metoprolol) were added  and she was gradually weaned off the inotropic support. A psychologist consulted for better management of her stress and emotional issues.  Follow-up:  The patient's condition began to improve after 48 hours with a decrease in chest pain and stabilization of vitals. Repeat echocardiogram after a week showed improvement in the left ventricular function. She was discharged on the tenth day with a prescription for ACE-I  beta-blocker and an appointment for outpatient psychotherapy sessions.  Conclusion:  This case represents a typical presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  which is often misdiagnosed as acute coronary syndrome. High index of suspicion and distinctive echocardiogram findings can help in early diagnosis and management. It reiterates the critical role of psychological stress in the pathogenesis of this disease  which necessitates the inclusion of psychological management as part of comprehensive therapy."
15,7,88,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial88,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy   Patient Information: The patient is a 57-year-old African American female  known by the initials J.T. She is a widow and lives alone. She has two children and three grandchildren who live out of state.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant past medical history of hypertension controlled by medication  hypercholesterolemia managed with statins and minor symptoms of anxiety for which she does not take medication. The patient has no history of cardiovascular diseases or any cardiac risk factors such as smoking  alcohol  or drug abuse.   Presenting Complaints: Patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe chest pain and dyspnea that started suddenly while she was having an argument over the phone with her son. She reported the pain was severe  located in the center of her chest  and radiated to her left arm. Accompanying the chest pain  she exhibited symptoms of nausea  profuse sweating  and a feeling of impending doom.  Clinical Findings: Upon presentation  J.T.'s blood pressure was elevated (170/100 mm Hg)  and heart rate was rapid at 110 bpm. An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Levels of cardiac biomarkers  specifically troponin T  were slightly elevated (0.10 ng/mL  reference range <0.01 ng/mL). Her echocardiogram demonstrated apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hypercontraction of the basal walls  typical findings for takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Therapeutic Intervention: Given the presentation and findings  J.T. was initially managed as an acute myocardial infarction patient with aspirin  clopidogrel  and intravenous nitroglycerin. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring. As the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was confirmed  her treatment was adjusted accordingly - continued on beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors)  and anxiety management.  Follow-up: On her follow-up after two months  J.T. reported she was feeling significantly better and was back to her regular daily activities. Repeated echocardiography demonstrated resolution of the previous left ventricle changes  confirming the temporary nature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy typical changes. Her blood pressure was well controlled  and she was advised to continue with her hypertensive medicine  cholesterol control  and to seek assistance for stress and anxiety management.  Conclusion: This case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy showcases the disease typical characteristics of a middle-aged woman under emotional stress presenting with signs that might initially suggest acute myocardial infarction. Being aware of takotsubo cardiomyopathy can save the patient from unnecessary invasive diagnostic interventions  guide appropriate treatment  and reassure the patient and their relatives of the typically good prognosis associated with this condition.
15,7,89,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial89,"Case Report   Patient Information  A 65-year-old Caucasian female presented to the Emergency Department (ED) at 2 AM complaining of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  associated with shortness of breath  and nausea. The patient is a retired teacher and lives with her husband and a pet dog. Her lifestyle factors include that she is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She is not involved in any strenuous physical activity and enjoys gardening and reading.  Medical History  The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension  which has been well controlled with hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily for the last 10 years. She also has a history of hypercholesterolemia managed with atorvastatin 20mg daily. She has no known drug allergies.  Recent History  Over recent weeks  the patient unfortunately faced the death of her close sister which caused her significant emotional stress. The chest pain started not long after getting the devastating news of her sister's demise  which she mentioned was far more severe than anything she'd previously experienced.  Investigations  In the ED  her EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Initial cardiac biomarkers returned with an elevated troponin level of 3.6 ng/ml (normal <0.04 ng/ml). Emergency coronary angiography was performed which surprisingly showed no significant coronary artery disease.   However  left ventriculography disclosed typical apical ballooning with basal hypercontractility  consistent with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  often referred to as broken heart syndrome. Echocardiogram showed a reduced ejection fraction of 35% (normal range 55-70%) with apical hypokinesia.  Treatment  Patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) for observation. She was initiated on guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure including low-dose beta-blocker (Carvedilol) and ACE inhibitor (Lisinopril). In addition  she was provided counselling and support to cope with her bereavement.  Outcome and Follow-Up  During her stay in the CCU  her symptoms gradually resolved  and repeat echocardiogram after two weeks demonstrated significant improvement in her ejection fraction to 50% with resolution of the apical hypokinesia. The patient was discharged with a follow up appointment in cardiomyopathy clinic. On her follow up visit one month later  further echocardiogram confirmed complete resolution of the left ventricular function abnormalities.   Brief Discussion  Also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress. The presentation can mimic that of an acute coronary syndrome. However  the classic finding of apical ballooning and absence of coronary occlusion can help differentiate between the two. While the recovery is typically good with medical management  the importance of stress management cannot be overstated."
15,7,90,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial90,Title: A Case Report on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 65-year-old Male  Introduction:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is a kind of nonischemic cardiomyopathy that presents similar to acute myocardial infarction. Initial investigations often misinterpret it as heart attack because of its similar symptoms including chest pain  breathlessness  and abnormal Electrocardiogram (ECG) results.  Case Presentation:  Patient Information: A 65-year-old Caucasian male.  Clinical Findings: The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath that had commenced 1 hour prior to consultation  soon after hearing of his wife's sudden death. The pain was severe  radiating to his left arm and not relieved by nitroglycerin.  Diagnostic Assessment: A 12-lead ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterior precordial leads  suggesting an anterior wall myocardial infarction. Serum troponin I level was elevated threefold above the upper limit of normal  reflecting cardiac damage. A transthoracic echocardiogram highlighted left ventricular apical ballooning  with hyperkinesia of the basal segments and akinesia of the apical and mid ventricular segments.  Therapeutic Intervention: He received initial treatment as per acute coronary syndrome  with aspirin  clopidogrel  low molecular weight heparin and oxygen. However  coronary angiogram was normal without any evidence of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis.  Follow-Up and Outcome: During the following week  the patient's symptoms gradually improved and the ventricular function normalized on repeat echocardiogram. He was discharged with advice for psychological counseling and follow-up at the cardiology clinic in 1 week.  Past medical history: The patient was a non-smoker  teetotaler  had mild hypertension which was well controlled by angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and there was no family history of heart disease. He was otherwise healthy without any other significant medical history.  Discussion: The clinical presentation mimicked acute myocardial infarction leading to initial confusion. However  normal coronary arteries on angiogram and the typical echocardiogram pattern led to the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient's acute emotional stress likely served as a trigger for his cardiac event. The rapid resolution of symptoms and improvement of ventricular function is characteristic of TTC.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes that TTC  though not very common  should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with symptoms mimicking acute coronary syndrome  particularly occurring post severe emotional stress  even in absence of significant risk factors for coronary artery disease. It also demonstrates the significant role of psychological stressors in precipitating this form of cardiomyopathy.
15,7,91,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial91,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 54-Year-Old Female  Patient Information  A 54-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the cardiology department of our hospital presenting with acute chest pain. The patient is divorced with no children and works as a middle-school teacher in the local school district. She has no history of smoking or alcohol abuse.  Past Medical History  The patient generally has good health with no significant past medical history. She has no family history of cardiac disease. Her BMI of 26 falls in the overweight range  although she reports an active lifestyle with regular exercise. She has not been diagnosed with diabetes  hypertension  or high cholesterol. She does not take any regular medication  aside from an occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for headaches.  Recent History  Two days before her admission  the patient experienced an unexpectedly stressful event at her place of work. Following this event  she reported feeling increasingly anxious with difficulty sleeping. After the onset of sudden  severe chest pain accompanied by shortness of breath  she visited the hospital fearing that she was experiencing a heart attack.  Clinical Findings  Initial examinations revealed classical signs of acute coronary syndrome – acute chest pain combined with ECG changes (ST segment elevation) and a mild increase in cardiac Troponin I levels. However  upon further examination with coronary angiography  there was no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture which would typically cause a heart attack.  A subsequent echocardiogram revealed a reduced ejection fraction (45%) and suggested global hypokinesis of the mid and apical segments of the left ventricle  with preserved function of the base. This contraction abnormality  mimicking the shape of a Japanese octopus trapping pot  or “takotsubo ” led to a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome.  Treatment and Follow-up  The patient was initially treated with aspirin  beta-blockers  and ACE inhibitors following her admission under the suspicion of acute coronary syndrome. Post-diagnosis  her drug therapy included only beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. She was advised on the importance of stress management given the likely trigger of her condition.  She was discharged after a week of monitoring in hospital  with her symptoms significantly improved. On subsequent follow-up 3 months later  repeated echocardiogram exhibited complete resolution of her left ventricular function.  Patient consent was obtained for publication of this case.  Discussion  This case highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of suspected acute coronary syndrome  particularly in post-menopausal women with recent exposure to significant emotional stress.
15,7,92,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial92,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following a Severe Emotional Trauma: A Case Report  Case Profile:   Patient Information:   A 65-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain  mild shortness of breath  and nausea. She was widowed and lived alone. She was a retired nurse  non-smoker  did not consume alcohol  and had an otherwise clean bill of health. There were no known drug allergies.   Medical History:   The patient's past medical history was significant for controlled hypertension and generalized anxiety disorder. She was on Ramipril 5mg daily for hypertension and was occasionally taking Alprazolam 0.25mg during episodes of anxiety. She had no history of ischemic heart disease  diabetes  stroke  or any other chronic medical conditions.   Clinical Findings:   On admission  the patient was found to be in distress with sweat-soaked clothes. Clinical examination revealed a blood pressure of 165/95 mm Hg  heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Cardiac examination showed regular rhythm without any murmur. Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally. Electrocardiography (ECG) displayed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4  suggestive of acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.   Diagnostic Assessment:  Troponin levels were slightly elevated. Coronary angiography was performed immediately  which surprisingly showed normal coronary arteries without any obstruction. A subsequent echocardiography demonstrated a significantly reduced ejection fraction of 35% (normal range: 55-70%) with apical ballooning and basal hypercontractility  pointing to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The diagnosis was confirmed by cardiac MRI  which showed transient left ventricular apical ballooning without any evidence of infarction.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was started on metoprolol 25mg BD and Ramipril was uptitrated to 10mg daily. Alprazolam was replaced with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)  Sertraline 50mg daily considering her anxiety disorder.   Follow-up & Outcome:  The post-admission course was relatively uneventful. The patient’s chest pain resolved within the next few days and she reported feeling better emotionally and physically. A repeat echocardiogram after six weeks showed complete recovery of left ventricular function with an ejection fraction improving to 60%.  Patient Perspective:  The patient indicated feeling significant emotional distress following her husband's death remarked to be the major emotional trauma triggering her condition. She appreciated the importance of psychological well-being and agreed to continue the SSRI therapy along with attending grief counseling sessions.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition often mimicking acute coronary syndrome  especially in postmenopausal women with recent severe stress. It also underlines the significance of considering mental health as an essential part of holistic patient care.

15,7,93,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial93,"Title: Progressive Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-year-old Female Patient  Patient Information: Our patient  Mrs. Joan Smith  is a 68-year-old Caucasian female residing in Battle Creek  Michigan. She is a retired elementary school teacher and lives with her 70-year-old husband. She has two adult children and five grandchildren. Mrs. Smith does not smoke  drinks alcohol occasionally and leads a moderately active lifestyle.  Chief Complaint: Mrs. Smith presented to the emergency department reporting severe chest pain that she described as """"sharp"""" and """"squeezing"""" in nature. The pain had started suddenly while she was gardening and persisted for about two hours.  Medical History: Mrs. Smith has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both are well-controlled with medications (Amlodipine 5mg/day for hypertension and Metformin 500mg/twice a day for diabetes). She was diagnosed with anxiety disorder five years ago following the death of her youngest son and is taking Sertraline 50mg/day. She also reported a history of intermittent chest pain in the previous months  unrelated to physical effort  and usually relieved by rest.  Current Medication: Amlodipine  Metformin  and Sertraline. She has no known drug allergies.  Physical Examination: On inspection  the patient appeared anxious. Vital signs were stable apart from a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed no extraordinary sounds  lungs were clear  and the rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Investigations: Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Initial troponin level was minimally elevated. Emergency coronary angiography was performed which did not reveal any significant coronary artery disease. Left ventriculogram demonstrated apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basal segments - findings consistent with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC).   Diagnosis: Given the clinical context and the investigations  Mrs. Smith was diagnosed with progressive Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as Broken Heart Syndrome.  Treatment and Course: The patient was admitted into our cardiac care unit. She was treated with standard heart failure management including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors  in addition to her existing medications. After a period of 10 days  her symptoms improved significantly  and she was discharged. On a 3-month follow-up visit  her ECG had normalized and a repeat echocardiogram showed complete resolution of the previous wall motion abnormalities.  Discussion: This case illustrates an episode of TTC in a postmenopausal woman with a history of anxiety disorder who presented with symptoms mimic acute coronary syndrome. Emotional stress could have triggered her TTC. Early recognition and treatment resulted in a favorable prognosis.   Conclusion: Given the potential for severe complications  it is crucial for clinicians to consider TTC in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain  especially in postmenopausal women with a history of emotional stress or psychiatric illness even if initial cardiac investigations are inconclusive."
15,7,94,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial94,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following Emotional Stress: A Single-Case Report  Patient Information:  The patient is a 67-year-old female  Caucasian  married  with a BMI of 26.8  non-smoker  and non-alcoholic.  Presenting Concerns:  The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  breathlessness  and palpitations  suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. The onset of symptoms occurred following an emotional stress event  i.e.  the sudden death of her husband.   Medical  Family  and Psychosocial History:  The patient has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. She has been on medication (Metformin and Lisinopril) for these conditions. The patient's family history is suggestive of ischemic heart disease  as her deceased husband had undergone stenting for coronary artery disease five years ago. The patient lives with her son and reports a supportive environment.  Examination and Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  the patient appeared distressed  with a heart rate of 114 beats per minute and blood pressure of 165/95 mmHg. Cardiac auscultation revealed no murmurs or gallops. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads which would usually suggest a septal myocardial infarction. However  patient reports of chest pain were inconsistent with a typical heart attack.   Diagnostic Assessment:  An immediate coronary angiogram was performed which showed no obstructive coronary artery disease. However  left ventriculography revealed apical ballooning of the heart  suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome.   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was managed conservatively with aspirin  a beta-blocker (metoprolol)  an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) and a statin (atorvastatin). Normal saline was given for hydration.  Follow-up: The follow-up echocardiogram done after ten days showed complete resolution of apical ballooning and systolic function was back within normal parameters. Based on her depressive symptoms  a psychiatrist was also consulted who diagnosed her with major depressive disorder. Once her chest pain resolved  she was discharged with a regimen of her previous medicines  along with an antidepressant (escitalopram) and a referral for outpatient grief counseling.   Patient Perspective: Expressing a sense of relief  the patient appreciated the clinical team's efforts in explaining the diagnosis and resultant treatment plan. She showed willingness to attend follow-up appointments and engage in the grief counseling sessions.  Conclusion: This case highlights the potential for severe emotional stress to lead to cardiomyopathy  even with non-obstructive coronary arteries. Early recognition and appropriate management of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are essential for good patient outcomes. 
15,7,95,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial95,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy In A 68-Year-Old Caucasian Female: A Case Report    Introduction: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as broken heart syndrome or apical ballooning syndrome  commonly presents similarly to acute myocardial infarction but without showing coronary artery occlusion. It is often triggered by severe stress and disproportionally affects postmenopausal women.  Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  currently residing in the United States  who presents with acute chest pain characterized by a crushing sensation.  Clinical Findings: The patient's initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-elevation in the precordial leads and her Troponin I levels were markedly increased. An echocardiogram revealed apical akinesia with hyperkinesia of the basal walls  suggestive of TTC  despite the absence of significant stress previously in the day.  Past Medical History: The patient's medical history includes hypertension  treated with an ACE inhibitor  and hyperlipidemia  treated with statins  over the past ten years. No history of smoking  alcohol consumption  or illicit drugs usage is reported. The patient’s family history reveals no cardiac problems.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initially treated with aspirin and heparin  considering acute myocardial infarction. After diagnostic confirmation of TTC  treatment was transitioned to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and antiplatelets.  Outcome and Follow-up: During hospitalization  the patient's symptoms significantly improved  with a marked decrease in Troponin I levels and no arrhythmias recorded. The patient was discharged after a week. A follow-up echocardiogram after two months showed complete normalization of left ventricular function.  Discussion: This case is distinctive as it presents TTC in a patient without any noticeable acute stress. It demonstrates the need for clinical awareness on TTC  which should be a differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with chest pain and ECG changes indicative of myocardial infarction  particularly in the absence of significant coronary artery disease.  Conclusion: Understanding the diverse presentations and triggers of TTC is critical in its diagnosis and treatment. Future research should explore the links between hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and TTC  given this patient’s medical history.    Key Words: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  Postmenopausal woman  Acute chest pain  Echocardiogram  Hypertension  Hyperlipidemia.
15,7,96,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial96,"Case Report: Female Patient Presenting with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following Death of Her Spouse  Patient Profile: The patient is a 67-year-old Hispanic woman living in a suburban community. She has three adult children and recently became a widow after her husband unexpectedly passed away due to a sudden heart attack. Her oldest daughter  who lives nearby  had noticed her mother's noticeable deterioration in health and emotional state since her father's passing and brought her to the hospital.  Medical History: Prior to her recent downturn  the patient had no significant medical issues apart from mild hypertension  which is controlled by daily medication (5mg Lisinopril). She had never smoked or consumed alcohol and had always followed a balanced diet. There was no known history of cardiac issues in her family.  Presenting Complaint and Examination: The patient was admitted with acute chest pain that radiated to the left arm and shortness of breath  which she described as feeling similar to """"an elephant sitting on my chest"""". The pain began suddenly and had progressively worsened  prompting her daughter to bring her to the hospital.   In the hospital  her vitals were taken: blood pressure 158/94 mmHg  pulse 112 bpm  respiratory rate 20  temperature 98.6°F  and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. On physical examination  the patient appeared in distress  but other than tachycardia  her examination was relatively unremarkable. There were no elevated jugular venous pressure or other signs of heart failure.  Laboratory Tests and Diagnosis: An EKG showed ST-segment elevations in the anterior precordial leads  and troponin was elevated  but less than typically seen in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A coronary angiogram showed no significant blockages that could have been responsible for her pain. A subsequent echocardiogram showed apical ballooning  with the base of the heart contracting normally but the middle and apical parts of the heart not contracting well. This suggested a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management and Outcome: The patient was placed on a beta-blocker (metoprolol) and an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril). She was also given aspirin and closely watched for complications for the next several days. There was no development of life-threatening arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock during her admission. She was discharged five days later with a plan to continue medications and sympathy therapy or counseling needed for her bereavement. On follow-up one month later  her symptoms have resolved  and repeat echocardiography showed recovery of her left ventricular function.  Clinical Lessons: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as “broken heart syndrome ” thus named because it often follows a stressful experience like the loss of a loved one  is a temporary heart condition that mimics heart attack symptoms. While prognosis is generally good  it highlights the need for the consideration of mental health and stressors in the management of physical conditions."
15,7,97,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial97,Title: Case Report - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 68-year-old Female  Patient Information: A 68-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  accompanied by nausea  and shortness of breath  similar to symptoms suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome.  Presenting Concerns: The patient experienced a sudden onset of pronounced chest pain and acute breathlessness post attending her granddaughter's wedding. Previously  no remarkable cardiac symptoms had been reported by the patient.  Medical History: The patient has a history of Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension  both controlled with medication (Metformin and Lisinopril  respectively). The patient also had a history of depression following the death of her spouse three years prior. She lived alone but had a supportive network of close family and friends and has had no known contact with illegal substances  tobacco  or alcohol.  Physical Examination: Upon physical exam  the patient appeared anxious and distressed. Her vital signs on admission were as follows: blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  and 95% oxygen saturation on room air.  Diagnostic Focus and Results: An electrocardiogram revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. Blood analysis showed slightly elevated cardiac troponin T levels but normal creatine kinase-MB levels. An emergent coronary angiogram was performed  which surprisingly showed no evidence of significant coronary artery disease. Left ventriculography demonstrated apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the base  consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment: The patient was started on heart failure treatment  which included beta-blockers (Carvedilol)  ACE inhibitors (Ramipril)  and diuretics (Furosemide). She was also referred for sessions with a clinical psychologist to manage associated psychological stressors.  Follow Up and Outcomes: Over the next few days  the patient's chest pain and breathlessness reduced significantly  and repeat echocardiography after two weeks showed full recovery of left ventricular function. She was discharged after 15 days with medications and a follow-up plan.   Patient Perspective: Initially  the patient expressed anxiety and fear over her condition. With proper explanation of her condition and the management plan  she felt reassured. She acknowledged the importance of addressing her psychological stressors and agreed to continue with her psychological treatment.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the association between emotional stress and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It also emphasizes the importance of considering TCM in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chest pain and elevated troponin levels  particularly in postmenopausal women with emotional stress. Regular follow-ups are critical in these patients to prevent recurrence and manage associated psychological conditions.
15,7,98,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial98,Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Mimicking Acute Myocardial Infarction in a 73-Year-Old Woman  Patient Information: This case report presents a 73-year-old Caucasian woman who appeared to our clinic with acute chest discomfort. The patient lives in rural Minnesota  is a non-smoker  and has a history of controlled hypertension using beta-blockers. She lives independently and carries out her everyday activities with little to no assistance.  Case Presentation: This patient arrived at emergency services presenting with intense retrosternal chest pain of sudden onset  accompanied by shortness of breath. Initially  it was described as a tightness that radiated towards the left arm and was associated with nausea and sudden onset of profuse sweating. She had no known allergies. The onset followed a severe emotional distress - the death of her husband a week prior. Her vital signs on admission were: pulse of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg  temperature of 98.2°F (36.8°C)  and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.  Medical History: Her medical history includes type 2 diabetes  treated with diet and metformin  and recently diagnosed osteoarthritis. The woman reported no previous cardiac symptoms and wasn’t aware of having any heart problems. There was no significant family history of either cardiac events or other major illnesses.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed an anxious patient in moderate distress  without any significant abnormalities. An ECG done at the time of admission showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior precordial leads representing possible anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Troponin I levels were elevated  and an urgent coronary angiogram was performed showing normal coronary arteries. An echocardiagram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with basal hypercontractility suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).   Diagnosis: Based on the patient's symptoms  elevated troponin and the typical ‘octopus pot’ appearance seen on echo  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was treated with supportive medical therapy including aspirin  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and was also provided emotional support as part of her treatment.  Follow-up and Outcomes: At the 3-month follow-up  her echocardiogram demonstrated complete resolution of the left ventricular dysfunction  supporting the diagnosis of TCM.   Patient Perspective: The patient reported improvements in her symptoms and was able to return to her daily routines without significant limitations.   Conclusion of the Case Report: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'  often presents very similarly to an acute myocardial infarction. This case emphasizes that TCM should be considered as a differential diagnosis in post-menopausal women presenting with chest pain after an acute emotional event.
15,7,99,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial99,"Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman: A Case Report  Patient Information: Ms. Jane Doe  a 66-year-old Caucasian female  was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED). Jane is a retired school teacher  recently widowed a year prior  and residing in the outskirts of Chicago. She is a nonsmoker with occasional alcohol intake and no known drug allergies.   Clinical Findings: The patient presented to the ED with severe chest pain  breathlessness  and palpitations  which she rated as 8 on a scale of 10. The discomfort was central and radiating to the left side  similar to a previous episode of angina. At the ED  her blood pressure was 135/90mmHg  and a resting 12-lead ECG revealed significant ST-segment elevation in the anterior and inferior leads.  Diagnosis: With a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  the cardiovascular team initially suspected acute myocardial infarction. However  Coronary Angiography revealed no typical characteristics of coronary artery disease (CAD). Serum troponin levels were elevated (5.2 ng/mL)  conflicting with the angiography results.   Further examination through Transthoracic Echocardiography and Ventriculography demonstrated a not-so-common finding: the mid-segment and the apex of the left ventricle were hypokinetic  with preserved basal function  presenting the """"apical ballooning"""" had a shape reminiscent of a Japanese octopus trap  termed """"Takotsubo"""". With these radiological findings  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC) was confirmed.  Intervention: Given the absence of CAD  invasive operative procedure was avoided. The patient was managed conservatively with Aspirin  β-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and Statin  catered to her symptomatic acute heart failure. The patient responded positively: within a week  her symptoms had markedly improved.  Patient was trained on stress management techniques as serial psycho-emotional turbulence or stress-induced spikes of catecholamines are considered typical triggering factors for TTC.  Follow-Up and Outcome: Over a period of 3 months  progressive cardiac imaging studies showed a gradual resolution of the regional wall motion abnormality. Ms. Doe reported a significant decrease in her symptoms  and her follow-up troponin levels normalized to 0.012 ng/mL. At 6 month follow-up  patient is doing well without any recurrent chest pain or breathlessness.  Practitioner Reflection: This case underscores the necessity of considering Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in differential diagnosis even if the primary suspicion is of acute myocardial infarction  especially in postmenopausal women with a history of recent intense emotional or physical stress. A comprehensive understanding of patient symptomatology and thorough cardiac imaging can aid a swift and correct diagnosis. Prompt  appropriate treatment helps ensure a favorable prognosis for these patients."
15,7,100,diagnosis15-prompt7-trial100,Title: Case Report of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 56-year-old Female Post-Surgical Patient  Patient Information:  The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian female with a previous medical history of hypertension and anxiety. She is a non-smoker and reports moderate alcohol consumption. Family history is significant for her father who died of myocardial infarction at the age of 69.  Clinical Findings: The patient was admitted for an elective hysterectomy due to uterine fibroids. The surgery was uncomplicated and the patient was stable post-operatively. However  three hours post-surgery  the patient reported severe chest pain and discomfort  accompanied by shortness of breath. Physical examination revealed a decreased S1 heart sound  slight jugular vein distention  and pulmonary rales on auscultation. Initial vital signs were blood pressure 145/100 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats/minute  and oxygen saturation of 89% on room air.  Diagnostic Assessment: An electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated ST segment elevation in the precordial leads. Troponin levels were found to be markedly elevated (6.2 ng/mL). Emergency coronary angiography did not discover any significant obstructive coronary artery disease. Left ventriculography revealed a reduced ejection fraction (40%) and apical ballooning indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was introduced to a heart failure regimen comprising an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and beta-blocker. She was also administered aspirin  a statin  and prescribed oxygen therapy to address desaturation issues. Psychiatry services were consulted given the patient's history of anxiety and possible contribution to the development of TCM.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: The patient demonstrated clinical improvement within a week  with resolution of symptoms. Repeat echocardiogram after one month presented an ejection fraction restored to baseline  now measuring 60%  and reversed apical ballooning. Follow-up appointments were scheduled to adjust her therapy and monitor her progress.   Discussion: This case underscores the significance of acute emotional or physical stress as triggers for TCM  frequently misdiagnosed as acute coronary syndrome due to similar presentation. The patient's post-surgical state likely constituted such a trigger. Her anxiety disorder may have also facilitated the development of TCM  necessitating further exploration of psychiatric contributions to this condition.   Patient consent: Obtained and documented.

15,9,1,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial1,"Patient Profile: Ms. E. W.  a 62-year-old Caucasian woman living in the suburbs  was presented to the emergency department (ED) of a local hospital. She's a school principal  widowed  with three grown children. She doesn't smoke  she occasionally consumes alcohol during social events. Ms. E. W. has a past medical history of hypertension (managed with medication) and hypercholesterolemia. Her family history includes her mother had diabetes  and father died of a stroke at his late 60s.  Presenting Problem: The patient came to the ED with a sudden  severe chest pain while delivering a presentation at a school board meeting. The pain had characteristics of acute coronary syndrome – severe  crushing pain radiating to the left arm with associated excessive sweating.  Examination and Findings: On examination  her blood pressure was recorded as 160/90 mmHg  and heart rate was 105 bpm  irregular. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads  mimicking an anterior wall myocardial infarction (heart attack). Blood tests showed a slight increase in cardiac enzymes. Given the results  the ED physician suspected a heart attack and initiated treatment accordingly.  Further Investigations and Diagnosis: Coronary angiogram performed subsequently did not reveal any significant coronary artery blockages typically associated with a heart attack. An echocardiogram  however  showed signs of left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning  a feature not typical of heart attacks but characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  The final diagnosis was therefore takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also called """"broken-heart syndrome """" following exclusion of a myocardial infarction.  Management: Given the stress directly before the onset of symptoms  it was concluded that this was likely the triggering factor. She was managed conservatively with medications including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics  and monitored closely.  Outcome: Following initial management at the ED and hospitalization for a few days  Ms. E. W. was discharged from the hospital with instructions for follow-up and proper stress management. Her condition improved gradually with complete recovery of heart function in follow-up echocardiograms. A psychiatrist addressed her ongoing high-stress levels. Recommendations were made to start yoga  mindfulness  and engage in regular physical activity.  This case showcases the importance of considering health conditions which can mimic common critical illnesses like a heart attack and shows why takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be considered particularly in postmenopausal women presenting with acute chest pain following a stressful event. Furthermore  proper stress management strategies are integral for secondary prevention in these patients."
15,9,2,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial2,Patient Presentation  The patient  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  reported to the emergency department with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. She rated her pain at an 8 on the scale of 10  describing it as a consistent heaviness localized in the mid-chest  with occasional sharp stabs. These symptoms were noted after she received news of her daughter's sudden critical illness. The patient has a history of mild hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and has been on Lisinopril 10mg daily and Simvastatin 20mg daily for the past 7 years. She has no known drug allergies.  The patient is an active former school teacher  now retired  and is a non-smoker. She denies any use of illicit drugs or alcohol. However  she does admit to experiencing high anxiety  consistent with her type-A behavior pattern. The patient has no history of chest pain or cardiac issues. Her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 57 and a brother has been diagnosed with angina pectoris.  On physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic with blood pressure 155/90 mmHg  pulse 105 beats per minute  temperature 98.6F  and rest of physical assessment unremarkable. EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads with Troponin-I levels slightly elevated at 0.8 ng/ml. Chest X-ray was normal and a Transthoracic Echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning with basal hypercontractility consistent with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  The patient was transferred to the CCU for observation and treated with aspirin 325mg  nitroglycerin for chest pain  and a beta-blocker  metoprolol 25mg  to control hypertension. Cardiac catheterization was done showing no coronary artery disease and confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Upon the administration of appropriate medications and with the application of stress reduction therapy  there was a significant improvement in the patient's condition. She was discharged on aspirin  continued with metoprolol and Lisinopril  with a course of low-dose benzodiazepines for a short period to control her anxiety.   The patient was recommended for follow up after 1 week with a cardiologist. Her family was also educated about the importance of stress reduction in her lifestyle  with advice for cardiac rehabilitation and psychological counseling.  This case illustrates that acute emotional stressors can precipitate Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  even in the absence of underlying coronary artery disease. It underscores the importance of considering this condition in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chest pain  especially in post-menopausal women with recent intense emotional stress.
15,9,3,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial3,Patient Case Presentation  Demographics: Mrs. S. Green is a 67-year-old Caucasian female. She is a retired elementary school teacher and lives alone in her home. She is a non-smoker  has never consumed alcohol  and follows a balanced diet. Mrs. Green has a BMI of 24.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Green has a medical history of hypertension and intermittent asthma  both of which are well-controlled with medication. One year ago  she was also diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. She has had no prior cardiac issues and her cholesterol levels have been in the normal range. She is good at adherence with her medications and follows up regularly with her primary healthcare provider.   Family History:  Her father died at the age of 79 due to myocardial infarction while her mother lived up to 84 and succumbed to Alzheimer's. Mrs. Green has two children  both of whom are alive and well. There is no family history of any inheritable disease.  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Green presented to the emergency department with severe chest discomfort and shortness of breath. Initially  she felt lightheaded and sweaty with no physical exertion. Soon after  she experienced pain in her chest that she described as 'crushing'. These symptoms arose suddenly around 2 hours after receiving distressing news about a family member's health.  Investigative Procedures and Results:  Her vital signs were stable upon arrival; however  an electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST-segment elevation  typically seen in myocardial infarctions. Later  cardiac enzyme studies like troponin were modestly elevated. Initial management for acute coronary syndrome was initiated. However  coronary angiography showed no obstructive coronary artery disease  which ruled out myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiography (Echo) revealed acute left ventricular dysfunction  with apical akinesis and basal hyperkinesis  mimicking the shape of a “takotsubo ” or Japanese octopus trap.   Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentations  results from investigations  and the patient's recent emotional stress  Mrs. Green was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) or 'Broken Heart Syndrome'.   Summary:  Mrs. Green was experiencing an emotional stressor that likely triggered her TCM. This diagnosis was affirmed by the presence of transient regional wall motion abnormalities in the left ventricle (LV)  absence of occlusive coronary disease  new EKG abnormalities  and modest elevation in cardiac troponin. Despite her significant chest pain and traditional ‘heart attack’ findings  her issue was non-ischemic and often completely reversible with supportive care and control of cardiovascular risk factors. As with any episode of acute heart failure  it is critical to identify and treat precipitating factors (including emotional stress or anxiety)  manage volume status  and prevent secondary myocardial injury.
15,9,4,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial4,Patient Information: Ms. Williams  a 63-year-old Caucasian female  presented with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath. She has a past medical history of hypertension  which is managed by metoprolol and lisinopril  and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to a history of domestic violence. She doesn't smoke or consume alcohol. Her immediate family history reveals a father who had coronary artery disease and a mother who died of stroke. There's no known history of cardiomyopathy in her family.   Present Illness: Ms. Williams works as a school bus driver and three days prior to her hospital visit  she was faced with an autopilot incident; her bus went out of control without any driver but was finally brought to halt by her. Following this  she experienced persistent pressure-like chest pain radiating to the neck and left arm  coupled with shortness of breath - symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome.  Investigations & Results: Lab investigations showed elevated troponin levels (0.23 ng/mL) with a negative test for CK-MB. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) showed T wave inversion in leads V1-V4. A subsequent angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries with no blockages  but her left ventricular angiography showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal segments  indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms  EKG results  and angiographic findings  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome) was established. This condition often mimics the symptoms of a heart attack and is typically triggered by severe emotional distress.  Management: Ms. Williams was admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) for close monitoring. She was given standard heart failure treatments  including ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics to relieve her symptoms and improve heart function. Furthermore  she was recommended to engage in psychotherapy along with the continuation of psychiatric medications for PTSD.  Prognosis: Patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy generally have a good prognosis with appropriate management and complete recovery of left ventricular function. However  given that Ms. Williams' condition seems to be triggered by emotional stress related to her PTSD  a concerted effort is necessary to manage her mental health to prevent recurrence. As part of her follow-up care  she will need close cardiology and psychiatric follow-ups.  This case illustrates the rare but significant condition of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It highlights the importance of considering the patient's mental health in the prevention of physical illnesses  especially in patients with known psychiatric illnesses such as PTSD.
15,9,5,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial5,"Patient Presentation  Ms. Jensen  a 68-year-old Caucasian female presented to the ER with chest pain and signs of acute distress. She is recently widowed  retired teacher living alone within the suburbs of New York.   Past Medical History  Ms. Jensen is a non-smoker  with a BMI in the overweight range at 29. She is diagnosed with well-regulated hypertension and has a history of chronic depression  managed with SSRI therapy. She has had no previous cardiovascular issues and has not been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus nor any lipid disorder. Her last routine cardiac risk check-up a year ago showed normal results. She has no known drug allergies.  Family History  Ms. Jensen’s family history is significant for cardiovascular disease: her father passed away at an early age (59) due to myocardial infarction and her older brother (75) has diagnosed ischemic heart disease.   Current Complaints  The patient reports experiencing acute  severe chest pain  similar to a """"clenching"""" feeling  radiating into her left arm approximately 4 hours prior to arrival at the ER  which she initially had attributed to indigestion. She reports feeling overall weak  shaky and experiencing “palpitations”  but no shortness of breath  nausea  or fainting.   Further Evaluation  An ECG was promptly conducted and showed ST-segment elevations. Following this initial assessment  an urgent transthoracic echocardiography was performed  revealing left ventricular apical ballooning with basal sparing  a commonly found feature in takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Blood analysis shows raised levels of cardiac biomarkers troponin T and NT-proBNP. Cardiac catheterization did not evidence any significant coronary artery disease.  Diagnosis & Management  Considering the results  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress/broken heart syndrome) was made  most likely triggered by the stress and grief associated with her recent bereavement.  The patient was admitted to the cardiology department where acute heart failure was managed pharmacologically with diuretics and ACE inhibitors. She was set up for close monitoring of her cardiac function and follow-up psychotherapy was recommended to manage stress levels and prevent recurrence.   Prognosis  Most people with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  especially when managed promptly  recover within days to weeks and do not experience long-term cardiac damage. Ms. Jensen was informed about the need for comprehensive control of her pre-existing hypertension  stress management  potential risk of recurrence  and the generally favourable prognosis of her condition."
15,9,6,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial6,Patient Presentation:  We are discussing a 68-year-old Caucasian female identified as Mrs. H  who was admitted to our emergency department complaining of a severe chest pain  accentuated by mild dyspnea. The onset had been sudden  during a highly stressful family confrontation.   Past Medical History:  Mrs. H had no previous known history of cardiac or pulmonary diseases. She is hypertensive on medication (Lisinopril 10 mg daily)  and she has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was a smoker  with a history of 20 pack-years but quit 15 years back. She does not have a history of diabetes  cancer  or any surgical procedures.  Family History:  No relevant family history could be reported. Her parents lived into their late 80s and died of non-cardiac causes. There's only one known cardiac event in her family  an uncle who reportedly had an 'infarct' at the age of 56.  Physical Examination:  On admission  the patient appeared acutely distressed. She is alert and oriented to person  place  and time. Vital signs revealed blood pressure 145/95 mmHg  heart rate 115 beats per minute  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 98% on room air.  Investigation and Diagnosis:  Her ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V5. Blood tests revealed slightly elevated cardiac troponin I levels. However  her lipid profile was within reference range. Emergency 2-dimensional echocardiography revealed hypo-kinetic apical segments with hyperactive basal segments typically reflecting the “takotsubo” or “Octopus pot” - Dr. Hikaru Sato's description.  MRI and coronary angiogram ruled out myocardial infarction  confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken-heart syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy).   Management:  Mrs. H was managed in the CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. Her hypertension and heart failure were managed with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. She responded well to the medical management and counseling and made a complete recovery. Her left ventricular function had fully normalized at the follow-up echocardiography 6 weeks later.  She was released with a prescription of aspirin  atenolol  and lisinopril with directions to follow up in the cardiology outpatient clinic and undergo a stress management program.    In her case  it was important to differentiate takotsubo cardiomyopathy from more common heart diseases like myocardial infarction  as the treatment methods differ. Ultimately  her recovery emphasizes the role stress might play in the pathogenesis of this condition.
15,9,7,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial7,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: Ms. Deborah  a 62-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain and shortness of breath. She currently lives alone and is a retired school teacher with no known drug or alcohol use. She has no children but has siblings  one of whom has a history of arthritis and the other is healthy. The only medication she takes is for hypertensive control.  Past Medical History: Ms. Deborah has a past medical history of hypertension which has been well-controlled with medication for the past 10 years. She has no previous history of cardiac diseases  surgeries  nor any known allergies.  Presenting Complaint & Examination: She described her chest pain as a sudden onset of severe left-sided chest pain  which was not related to exertion and not associated with any other symptoms. The pain was non-radiating and lasted over an hour before she decided to seek medical attention. Her blood pressure was 152/92 mmHg  pulse rate 98 bpm  respiratory rate 20 bpm  and the oxygen saturation 94% on room air.   Investigations: Laboratory tests revealed a significant rise in Troponin I level (20.3 ng/ml) and Creatine Kinase-MB (CK-MB) level (45 U/L)  suggestive of myocardial injury. The EKG demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads (V2-V6) and T wave inversion. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was then performed which revealed hypokinesia in the mid and apical segments of the left ventricle  suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Clinical Course & Management: Ms. Deborah was admitted to the cardiology department where she was treated with standard heart failure medications including beta blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and aspirin. She was also referred for psychological counseling given the suspected stress-related nature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She showed good response to the treatment with a significant improvement in her clinical symptoms and was discharged home with regular follow-up appointments scheduled at the cardiology clinic.  Discussion: In the case of Ms. Deborah  the sudden onset of severe chest pain  elevated cardiac enzymes  and the characteristic features of wall motion abnormalities in the TTE were key findings for diagnosing takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Also known as stress-induced or broken heart syndrome  this condition is characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the heart muscles  often triggered by severe stress. The patient’s social history did not reveal any recent stressful events  suggesting that the etiology can be multifactorial. The case exemplifies the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential in patients presenting with chest pain especially in post-menopausal women. 
15,9,8,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial8,Case Presentation  Patient Information:   The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency room with intense chest pain and shortness of breath  symptoms mimicking a heart attack. The patient is a widow living alone in an urban setting  with her two adult children residing nearby.  Past Medical History:  The patient has no known history of heart disease. Her past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes (controlled by metformin) and hypertension (controlled by lisinopril). She is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or drug misuse. She also has a history of generalized anxiety disorder and is currently on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.  Complete Demographics and Social History:   Patient retired from her job as an elementary school teacher five years ago. She maintains an active lifestyle  including regular walks and involvement in a weekly bridge club. Recently  the patient has faced multiple stressors  including the death of a close friend and increasing loneliness amid the COVID-19 pandemic's social distancing restrictions.  Family History:  The patient's father died at 72 due to a heart attack. Her mother  who lived up to 78  was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The patient's older brother underwent angioplasty at the age of 60. There's no history of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the family.  Physical Examination and Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed slightly irregular heart sounds and a blood pressure of 170/90 mmHg. Blood tests showed a slight increase in cardiac troponin levels  but not as high as typically found in a myocardial infarction. ECG demonstrated ST-segment elevation  while echocardiogram and ventriculogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle  consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis and Management:  The patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also referred to as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome. Her condition seemed to be triggered by the extreme stress and anxiety she'd been experiencing recently. She was closely monitored  and her blood pressure was brought under control. Her current medication regimen was deemed appropriate  although stress-reducing approaches  such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and regular follow-ups  were recommended.  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a temporary heart condition often triggered by stress  closely resembles myocardial infarction but doesn't involve blocked heart arteries. This case reinforces the significance of considering alternative diagnoses when heart disease symptoms present in patients  particularly in post-menopausal women with a history of psychological stress  and without traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease.
15,9,9,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial9,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old  Caucasian female  presenting to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of severe chest pain that was radiating to her left arm. Her symptoms started while she was witnessing an armed robbery at her local convenience store. She describes the pain as a severe squeezing sensation  rating it at a 10/10 on the pain scale. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and nausea.   Past Medical History:  The patient’s medical chart revealed a history of controlled hypertension  for which she is taking lisinopril 10 mg daily. She also has a history of borderline diabetes but is not on any anti-diabetic medications  managing her condition with diet and exercise. She has no known allergies to medications.  Family History:  A significant family history includes a father who died of myocardial infarction at the age of 62  and a mother who lived till 79 but was diagnosed with Alzheimer's later in life. Her two older brothers are alive and have hypertension  but none have any history of heart disease.  ED Course:  In the ED  the patient’s EKG showed ST segment elevations in the anterolateral leads  concerning for an acute myocardial infarction. She was emergently taken to the catheterization lab where a left heart catheterization didn't show any significant blockage to explain the EKG findings.   Ultrasound of the heart demonstrated normal function and wall motion in the base of the heart but depressed function in the mid and apical segments consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'. The patient received conservative management  with an emphasis on stress management and regular follow-up.  Psychological Screening:  Given the nature of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy ostensibly being related to mental or emotional stress  the patient was also screened for anxiety and depression. The results highlighted pre-existing anxiety but no depression was detected.  Hospital Course and Treatment:  The patient remained stable during her hospital stay and was treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and was provided counselling and stress management resources. Her chest pain gradually improved over a few days  as did her heart function on repeat echocardiograms.  Upon discharge  she was advised to continue her medications  emphasis was placed on regular follow-ups with the cardiology and mental health team  and she was counseled on ways to manage her stress and anxiety effectively.  Brief Summary:  The diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an important differential to be considered in individuals  particularly post-menopausal women  presenting with chest pain and EKG changes  particularly in the aftermath of a significant mental or emotional stressor. This case underscores the importance of considering a comprehensive differential diagnosis and performing appropriate investigations to pinpoint the issue and provide meaningful treatment.
15,9,10,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial10,Patient Presentation  Patient Information:  Ms. A  a 67-year-old African-American woman  visited the Emergency Department with complaints of severe chest pain  shortness of breath  nausea  and light-headedness. She lives in a suburban community with her retired husband. Ms. A is a retired school teacher  non-smoker  and occasionally consumes alcohol.  Medical History:  Past medical history reveals that she has hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are well controlled with medication (Amlodipine 5mg once daily and Atorvastatin 10mg once daily). However  she has been noncompliant with medication for the past couple of weeks due to a recent death in her family.  Family History:  She has a family history of early-onset coronary artery disease  as her father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 52. Nonetheless  her family history does not point to any record of inherited disorders or malignancies.  Presentation and Examination:  On examination  her heart rhythm was regular but tachycardic with a rate of 110 bpm  and BP was 165/95 mmHg. Breath sounds were normal  but slight pulmonary edema was observed. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads  whereas troponins were mildly elevated. Her full blood count  renal function  liver function  lipid profile  and thyroid function test were within normal ranges.  Hospital Course:  She was initially treated as acute coronary syndrome given her symptoms and ECG changes. However  a coronary angiography displayed no significant obstructive coronary disease but indicated a typical apical ballooning pattern of the left ventricle  consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Given the recent emotional stress of a family death and lack of significant coronary artery disease  she was finally diagnosed with TCM  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome.  Treatment:  She was treated with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers  alongside her antihypertensive and statin therapy. Her symptoms improved over a few days with the supportive care.  Follow-up:  Ms. A was scheduled for an outpatient follow-up appointment in one month. On her follow-up visit  echocardiogram reported normal left ventricular function  indicating recovery from the TCM episode. It was also recommended for her to see a grief counselor to manage emotional stress better.  Conclusion: Ms. A's case underscores the importance of considering TCM as a possible diagnosis in post-menopausal women presenting with chest pain  especially when there's evidence of emotional stress. It also highlights the need for better patient education about medication compliance and stress management in preventing TCM episodes.
15,9,11,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial11,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile:  Mrs. Angela Davis  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She also reported lightheadedness and fatigue over the past 4 days. The pain was not relieved by rest and didn't radiate to any other part of the body.   Past Medical History:  She is moderately obese (BMI 32) and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension. She quit smoking 12 years ago and consumes alcohol occasionally. She has a history of poor medication compliance and infrequent follow-up appointments.  Family History:  She denied any family history of cardiovascular diseases  but both her parents were reported to have diabetes and hypertension.  On Physical Examination:  Vital signs included a heart rate of 115 beats per minute  blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  a respiratory rate of 24  and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Her body temperature was 98.5°F. She appeared anxious and was in visible distress.  Investigations:  The EKG revealed signs consistent with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Troponin levels were elevated. However  coronary angiography  which is the definitive test for coronary artery disease  showed no significant blockages in the coronary arteries.   Echocardiography revealed left ventricular apical ballooning  and the basal segments were hyperkinetic  which were findings consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment and Outcome:  Mrs. Davis was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit where she was monitored closely. Medications including beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and aspirin were commenced. Her symptoms started to improve after 48 hours.  A follow-up echocardiogram done 10 days later showed a marked improvement in ventricular function. She was subsequently discharged on beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.  Summary:  This case illustrates that although the symptoms and initial test results might suggest a heart attack  takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be a consideration if coronary angiography is normal. Moreover  it underscores the need for assessing physical symptoms in conjunction with psychosocial stressors as Mrs. Davis was going through a divorce  indicating that emotional stress might have contributed to the onset of this condition. Further research is necessary to understand the pathophysiology and treatment strategies for takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
15,9,12,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial12,Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  Mrs. S  who is currently unemployed. She lives with her husband in a suburban neighborhood and has two adult children who live out of state. She was a high school teacher but retired two years ago. She does not consume alcohol  nicotine  or illicit drugs and maintains a balanced diet.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented with severe chest pain and shortness of breath following an extremely stressful event - the sudden death of her close friend.  Medical History: Mrs. S has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been controlled with medication. She has a past surgical history of a hysterectomy performed 15 years ago and does not have any known drug allergies.   Family History: Her father died of a heart attack at 70 and her mother died of stroke at 72. She has a younger brother diagnosed with hypertension  and her older brother died in a car accident at the age of 50.  Physical Examination: On examination  Mrs. S was in acute distress. Her eyes were teary  and she was speaking in short and shallow breaths. Her blood pressure was high at 160/90 mmHg  her pulse rate was fast at 100 beats per minute  and she was afebrile.  Clinical Findings: Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  mimicking the pattern of acute myocardial infarction. Subsequent coronary angiography  however  indicated no significant coronary artery disease. Echocardiography demonstrated hypokinesis of the mid left ventricle and apical ballooning  suggestive of TC.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation  ECG findings  absence of significant coronary artery disease  and the typical echocardiographic findings  Mrs. S was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TC)  also known as broken heart syndrome  typically triggered by intense emotional or physical stress.  Treatment & Follow-up: She was admitted to the ICU and started on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors to help manage her symptoms and reduce the stress on her heart. She had a positive therapeutic response and her condition stabilized within seven days. However  emotional counseling was recommended to her to help her cope with her grief and reduce her risk for future stress that can trigger another TC episode.  This case underscores the significant physiological impact of emotional stress and the importance of considering Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with sudden chest pain and dyspnea  particularly in the context of severe psychological stress.  
15,9,13,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial13,Patient Information:  • Mr. Jones  a 64-year-old African American male  Presenting Complaints:  • Severe chest pain and shortness of breath that began suddenly while watching a football game. • Patient reports that he was under significant emotional stress due to the game.  Past Medical History:  • History of essential hypertension  manage with daily Losartan for the past four years. • No prior history of heart disease or heart attacks.  Social History:  • Denies smoking. • Drinks a glass of wine occasionally. • Prior employment includes 30 years in a stressful corporate career.  Family History:   • Mother died at age 66 of myocardial infarction. • Father has a history of hypertension and stroke but is currently alive. • One sibling  a brother  died prematurely at 45 due to a motor accident.  Physical Examination:  • Vital signs: Blood Pressure: 160/100 mmHg  Heart Rate: 110/min  Temperature: 98.7F  Respiratory Rate: 22/min  Oxygen Saturation: 96% at room air. • Cardiac exam: Normal S1 and S2  no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  • Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. • Peripheral pulses: Normal  no edema noted.  Impression:  From the hospital admission  diagnostic testing  including cardiac imaging  was conducted that suggested an abnormal left ventricular shape. Troponin levels were elevated  but coronary angiography displayed no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as “Broken Heart Syndrome ” was diagnosed.  Treatment Plan:  1. In-hospital monitoring of cardiovascular status. Administer aspirin  beta-blockers  and ACE inhibitors. 2. Stress management counseling. 3. Close follow-up with a cardiologist and managing hypertension cautiously. 4. Patient education about Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy and lifestyle modifications to lower heart disease risk.  Given his past chronic stress exposure and presentation during an acute emotional stress event  the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy seems appropriate. It should be noted with extreme caution that prognosis is generally favorable with appropriate management  but attention should be to psychiatric evaluation/ referral for stress management and preventing potential recurrence.   Discharge from the hospital was accomplished after cardiovascular status became stable. The patient was educated about the condition and necessary medications  lifestyle modifications  including a low salt diet for hypertension  regular exercise  and stress management techniques. Follow-up visits with the cardiology outpatient department were scheduled.   Close observation and heart health maintenance will be crucial parts of Mr. Jones’s ongoing health plan. As always  it will also be essential for Mr. Jones to maintain open lines of communication with his healthcare provider. This will ensure that any potential complications or symptoms are addressed as soon as possible in order to prevent any further health issues.
15,9,14,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial14,Patient Presentation  Mr. John  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and signs of shock. His BP was 100/60 mmHg  HR was 120 bpm  and SpO2 was 92%. His initial EKG demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the anterior wall leads. Lab results revealed mildly elevated Troponin levels.  Past Medical History  He has a known history of hypertension  hyperthyroidism  and mild chronic kidney disease. However  he is non-compliant to antihypertensive medications. He is a non-smoker  consumes alcohol moderately  and has a sedentary lifestyle.  Family History  The family history is noteworthy for cardiovascular disease  particularly heart failure in his father who died at the age of 81 and a brother with a myocardial infarction in his late 60’s.  Treatment & Hospital Course  Initial management was carried according to acute coronary syndrome guidelines. However  emergent coronary angiography revealed non-obstructive coronary artery disease. The left ventriculogram demonstrated apical hypokinesis and hypercontractility of the basal walls  a finding consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   He was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit for management and optimization of his congestive heart failure. His stay was complicated by transient hypotension that was managed effectively. Over the next week  his symptoms significantly improved  and repeat echocardiography showed normalization of LV function.  Further Investigation & Psycho-Social Background  Inquiring about recent stressors  he revealed that his wife had passed away two weeks ago after battling with lung cancer. The sudden demise of his wife had left him devasted. Hence  the presence of emotional stress and typical LV function patterns made a probable diagnosis of stress-induced (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy.  Education about disease  importance of adherence to his prescribed medication regimen  and engagement in moderate physical activities were reinforced. He was also advised to consider seeking help from support groups or psychological therapies to manage grief and loss. He was discharged in stable condition with a follow-up cardiology appointment within two weeks.   Conclusion  The diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome  is an important consideration in seemingly healthy individuals with sudden onset chest pain and normal coronary arteries  especially amidst recent emotional stress. The prognosis is generally good with appropriate management and emotional support. 
15,9,15,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial15,"Patient: Mrs. J  Age: 67  Sex: Female  Race: Caucasian  Background Information: Mrs. J was rushed into the emergency department of our hospital reporting acute chest pain and shortness of breath. She had no prior history of heart disease but has been treated for hypertension and Type II diabetes for over a decade. Mrs. J admitted to having chronic stress due to caring for her husband who recently passed away from cancer. Further  Mrs. J has a family history of stroke from her maternal side.  Presentation: Mrs. J was extremely anxious and complaining of severe crushing chest pain which began suddenly at rest. She reported feeling fatigued over the past few days  but nothing that she would describe as abnormal. Her pain was said to be similar to that experienced during a myocardial infarction (heart attack)  but not identical. She denied any notable triggers to her pain but did indicate her husband's death has been continually stressful.  Examination: On initial physical examination  Mrs. J had a respiratory rate of 18  pulse of 100  blood pressure of 170/90 and her oxygen saturation was 94%. An examination of the heart revealed tachycardia but no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.   Investigation: Mrs. J's initial ECG suggested signs of ST-segment elevation  which at a glance  suggested an acute coronary syndrome. However  her subsequent coronary angiogram showed no significant coronary artery stenosis  which rules out an obstructive coronary disease. Upon observation of a left ventriculogram  it appeared that the apex of the left ventricle balloons out during contraction  given the characteristic shape of """"takotsubo"""" which means """"octopus pot"""" in Japanese.   Diagnosis: Based on her symptoms  coronary angiogram  ventriculogram  the absence of significant coronary artery disease  and the presence of a stressful trigger  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""" was made.   Treatment: Mrs. J was admitted to the cardiology ward for close supervision. She was initially managed as though she was having a heart attack because the symptoms and test results are similar. She was given aspirin  beta-blockers  and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors). Her condition improved gradually. Alongside  her blood pressure and sugar levels were managed effectively. We also recommended a follow-up with a psychiatrist for possible anxiety or depression related to the loss of her husband.  Plan: Mrs. J is to be followed up in the cardiology clinic within 2 weeks of discharge and to continue her blood pressure and diabetes medications. She was advised to start stress management and relaxation techniques and will also be referred to grief counseling services.   Discussion: Mrs. J's case is a classic presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The condition  which frequently occurs in postmenopausal women  is usually triggered by physical or emotional stress. Despite the acute presentation  prognosis is typically favorable with appropriate supportive management."
15,9,16,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial16,"Patient Information: Mrs. Smith is an 80-year-old widowed Caucasian female who recently moved to a skilled nursing facility due to persistence mobility difficulties.  Presenting Complaint:  Mrs. Smith reported sudden onset chest pain and difficulty in breathing that started following an antagonistic family visit that provoked a significant emotional upset.  Medical History: Mrs. Smith has a past significant medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia that was managed with a long-term prescription of Lisinopril and Atorvastatin  respectively. However  she has no history of ischemic heart disease  diabetes mellitus  or pulmonary diseases. She's a non-smoker and drinks alcohol only occasionally  with her last drink recorded as 1-2 glasses of wine two weeks ago.   Family History: Her father died of a myocardial infarct at the age of 70 years and her mother of a cerebrovascular stroke in her late seventies. She has one brother who has a history of coronary artery disease.  Current Presentation: Physical exam showed regular heart rate of 92/min  BP of 165/95 mm Hg  and SpO2 of 92%. She appeared anxious  was cold to touch with profuse perspiration. Bloodwork showed elevated troponin I levels  suggesting myocardial injury while other parameters including electrolytes  kidney function and liver function were within normal limits. Her chest X-ray was normal but an ECG manifested mild ST-segment elevation indicative of acute coronary syndrome. However  Coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries. Echocardiography showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction  which is highly suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis: Taking her clinical presentation  diagnostic findings  and the precipitating emotional stress into account  Mrs. Smith was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often referred to as """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Plan:  The plan includes close observation of vital signs  telemetry  and symptomatic relief for chest pain. Medical treatment for heart failure including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors and diuretics was given. Stress management and therapy to cope with her emotional distress was provided. Counseling on lifestyle modification  medication adherence  and signs of heart failure exacerbation was given upon discharge.  Discussion: Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy is a form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy which is likely due to catecholamine excess triggered by acute emotional stress. It presents much like an acute coronary syndrome and is characterized by reversible left ventricle dysfunction and the absence of obstructive coronary disease. The management is supportive and the prognosis is usually favorable with most patients recovering completely. It is more common in post-menopausal women  suggesting a potential role of decreased estrogen.   Risk Factors: Major risk factors include being female (particularly post-menopausal)  hypertension  excessive emotional stress and history of a neurological disorder or mental health disorder. Clearly  in this case  Mrs. Smith’s age  gender  past history of hypertension  and significant emotional distress may have all contributed towards her condition. "
15,9,17,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial17,"Patient's Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of hypertension and chronic stress due to multiple hardships  including the recent death of her husband. She was living independently and maintaining a healthy lifestyle before her recent episode. She has no known drug allergies. The patient has a family history of heart diseases - her deceased husband had chronic congestive heart failure and her father died at the age of 69 because of a myocardial infarction.  Presenting Issue: She presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started earlier that evening. Her symptoms started suddenly while she was watching a television show. The pain was described as a crushing sensation  radiating to the left arm and jaw.  Clinical Examination & Interventions: On examination  her blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Her breath sounds were normal but the heart sounds revealed a gallop rhythm. The ECG showed ST-segment elevations in the anterior precordial leads  mimicking an anterior myocardial infarction. Cardiac enzymes - Troponin T and CK-MB were heightened. The Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a significant reduction in the left ventricular ejection fraction with apical ballooning  while the bottom and midsections of the left ventricle functioned well  giving the appearance of being """"tako-tsubo""""  thus leading to a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome.  The interventional cardiologist was consulted and angiography was done which showed no obstructive coronary artery disease thus ruling out any myocardial infarction.  Therapeutic Approach: The patient was treated with aspirin  ACE inhibitors  and beta-blockers. Due to her stressful life scenario  a psychiatric consult was sought  and she was started on stress management techniques and mild anxiolytics. Follow-up echo after 4 weeks showed complete recovery of cardiac function.  Outcome: Patient's condition started improving gradually with her reporting less occurrence of chest pain  and after a month  her echo showed significant improvement in her condition. The patient was advised to follow the prescribed course of medication and continue with regular cardiology follow-ups to avoid recurrence.   Summary: This case re-emphasizes the recognition and early intervention of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  especially in post-menopausal women with sudden stressful scenarios mimicking myocardial infarctions. It endorses the value of a multi-disciplinary approach in managing such cases where a psychiatrist can play a pivotal role alongside cardiologists."
15,9,18,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial18,Patient Summary:   Mrs. R is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  retired schoolteacher  with a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She has no known allergies and her surgical history is unremarkable. She lives alone since her divorce 10 years ago and has two legally adult children who live out-state.   The patient is a non-smoker and denies any history of alcohol or substance abuse. She does not have any family history of heart disease but her father had hypertension and her maternal aunt was diabetic. Recently  she has been under significant stress due to the passing away of a close friend.   Presenting Symptoms:  Mrs. R presented to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain that started two hours prior to admission. The pain is located in the anterior chest  radiating to the back  and associated with shortness of breath  nausea  and lightheadedness.   Clinical Findings:  In the emergency department  her vitals were stable except for slightly elevated blood pressure. Her ECG demonstrated ST segment elevation in the anterior-lateral leads. Blood workup revealed mildly elevated cardiac troponin I levels. A subsequent coronary angiogram was performed that revealed no significant coronary artery disease to account for the ECG changes. An echo cardiogram indicated dyskinesia of the apical and mid segments of the left ventricle with preservation of the basal function  giving a visual appearance similar to a 'takotsubo'  a Japanese octopus trap - hence  the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (‘broken heart syndrome’) was made.  Treatment:  The patient was admitted to the cardiology service for close monitoring and management. She was started on angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and beta blockers. Her symptoms resolved over the next couple of days with optimal medical management. She was counseled on stress management and was referred to a local support group to help cope with her recent personal loss.  Conclusion:  Mrs. R's case illustrates the classic presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This is often precipitated by emotional or physical stress and typically has an acute onset of symptoms mimicking that of a myocardial infarction. Serial ECGs  cardiac biomarkers  and an echo cardiogram are key to making the diagnosis. The prognosis is generally good with appropriate medical management and stress management strategies.
15,9,19,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial19,"Patient Profile  Name: Mary B.  Age: 65-Year-Old Gender: Female Occupation: Retired School Teacher Ethnicity: Caucasian  Marital status: Widowed Residence: Urban  Presenting Complaint  Patient presents with a sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath and palpitations similar to a """"heart attack"""". This happened after she received the news about her son's sudden death in an accident.  Past Medical History  Mild hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus well-controlled by diet and medication. Mary does not have any history of heart disease. She has always been compliant with her medications and follows regular check ups with her primary care doctor.  Family History  She has lost her parents and her husband in their late 60s to cardiovascular diseases. There's no record of unusual mental illness in the family.  Examination  On examination  Mary seems anxious and chronically stressed. Vital signs show a blood pressure of 150/95 mmHg and heart rate of 110 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular examination reveals mild tachycardia with no other abnormalities. Respiratory  abdominal and neurological examinations are unremarkable.  Investigations  High-sensitivity troponin T  a marker of myocardial damage  was elevated above the 99th percentile. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST-segment elevation. Echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning and hyperkinesis of the basal segments  consistent with the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome).  Treatment  The treating team chose to supportively manage with heart failure medications which includes beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors)  and diuretics  and to continue monitoring her condition.  Outcome  Patient reported improved symptoms over the course of a week; a repeat echocardiogram after 2 months revealed normalization of heart morphology and function.  Summary  This case highlights the fact that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  although relatively rare  should be considered in the differential diagnosis in a patient presenting with chest pain  particularly in postmenopausal women with recent severe emotional stressors. Rapid diagnosis  differentiation from acute coronary syndrome  and supportive management can result in complete recovery. Discussion with the patient regarding possible triggers and management of stress is also an integral part of treatment."
15,9,20,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial20,"Patient Presentation  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian woman named Mrs. Barney. She is a retired high school teacher  and lives alone since the passing of her husband five years ago. Mrs. Barney has two daughters who stay nearby and visit her regularly.  Past Medical History  The notable aspect of Mrs. Barney's past medical history includes controlled hypertension  which has been under medical management for the past 10 years  and an episode of major depressive disorder following her husband's demise. She has no known allergies or genetic ailments. She has a history of sporadic smoking but quit 15 years ago. She does not consume alcohol. There are no prior reported incidents of heart disease.  Family History  When it comes to family history  Mrs. Barney's father had suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 75 and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Her mother had diabetes and passed away due to breast cancer at 70. There is no history of heart diseases in her siblings  and daughters are healthy.  Presenting Complaint  Mrs. Barney presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She describes the onset of her symptoms as sudden and insists they occurred in conjunction with receiving distressing news about the closure of the school where she served for 35 years  which she refers to as """"a substantial part of her identity.""""  Hospital Course  On presentation  her ECG indicated ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads with no prior similar ECG for comparison. Initial Troponin-I was elevated. Upon these findings  she was admitted for an urgent cardiac catheterization. The angiogram revealed no significant blockages to justify it as an acute coronary syndrome  despite the initial suggestive ECG and elevated Troponin.  Diagnosis and Management  Considering the circumstances surrounding symptom onset  notably her emotional distress and angiogram results  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome.' She was started on beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and provided counseling support to manage her psychological stress effectively.  At discharge  her symptoms had significantly improved  and she was advised to continue her medications  regular outpatient follow-ups  and engage in distress management activities.  In terms of prognosis  the patient was informed that though the recovery from this acute phase may take anywhere from days to weeks  studies suggest that overall long term prognosis for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is similar to that in patients with coronary artery disease.  By compiling a medical history  emotional triggers  and angiogram results  it was possible to narrow down to a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also highlighting the importance of taking into account emotional stress and its pathophysiological repercussions in disease processes.

Diagnostic Tests: An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  resembling an acute myocardial infarction pattern. Emergency cardiac enzymes were suggestive of myocardial injury with a raised Troponin-I. Subsequent coronary angiogram was performed  which showed no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease.  The echocardiogram demonstrated a characteristic finding of apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved basal function consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. These findings in the presentation of chest pain  EKG changes  raised cardiac enzymes  emotional stress  and the absence of obstructive coronary disease aided in concluding the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management: The patient was managed conservatively with the continuation of beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and anxiolytic medications. Emotional support and counseling were also provided.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome""""  occurs predominantly in postmenopausal women and is often triggered by severe physical or emotional stress. The pathophysiology is not entirely understood  but it's believed to involve catecholamine excess  microvascular dysfunction  or myocardial bridging.  The patient's outcome was favourable. Her chest pain resolved over the next days and an echocardiogram displayed improved left ventricular function. She underwent a follow-up therapeutic session to enable her to develop better stress-coping mechanisms.   This case underscores the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain  especially in post-menopausal women with stress triggers  even in the absence of significant coronary artery disease.

15,9,22,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial22,Patient Presentation: ------------  The patient  Mrs. C  is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  currently retired and living with her husband. She has two children  both of whom are in good health. No immediate or extended family members with a history of significant cardiovascular disease can be established.   Past Medical History: ---------------  Mrs. C's past medical history is significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and an episode of mild depression. Her hypertension and diabetes have been well managed through medication and lifestyle modifications. She has below average BMI and a non-smoker. The last oral glucose tolerance test conducted six months ago was normal. This patient does not routinely drink alcohol and denies any illicit drug use.  Present Complaint & Examination: -------------------  Mrs. C presented to the emergency department exhibiting classic signs of acute coronary syndrome  complaining of sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the left arm. She reported a large amount of stress and emotional turmoil over the course of the past week due to the sudden death of her younger brother. Her EKG showed signs of ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads.  Diagnosis & Management: ----------------  Given the nature of her symptoms  the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was suspected. This was further supported by the fact that her angiogram showed insignificant coronary artery disease but confirmed the classic 'apical ballooning' image seen in takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome).  Her treatment plan involved initially managing her acute symptoms with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Given her diabetic background  her medication was reassessed to ensure none could potentially worsen her condition. A referral to see a clinical psychologist was also suggested  given the intense emotional stress that tends to precipitate this condition  and her history of depression.  Follow-up : ----------  On follow-up  she reported a decrease in her chest pain and overall stress levels. A repeat echocardiogram was conducted after four weeks which showed considerable recovery of her left ventricular systolic function. Mrs. C is to continue with the prescribed medication  modify her lifestyle and attend regular follow-ups at the cardiology clinic.   In conclusion  this case serves as a reminder that acute myocardial infarction is not the only cause of acute chest pain and care must be taken to diagnose and treat less common causes such as takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Additionally  the case draws focus on the potential cardiovascular effects of significant emotional stress and highlights the importance of early diagnosis and intervention in improving patient prognosis.
15,9,23,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial23,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  referred to as Mrs. A. She is a retired school teacher  a widow living alone without support save her only daughter who visits her occasionally. Mrs. A. presents with severe chest pain  resembling symptoms associated with myocardial infarction. However  upon closer examination and angiography  no significant obstructions in the coronaries were discovered  leading us to the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""".  Past Medical History:  Mrs. A. has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which has been managed through medication and diet for the past 20 years. She also has type 2 diabetes  controlled by dietary measures and oral hypoglycemic agents. She does not smoke or consume alcohol  and there is no known history of illicit drug use.   She was hospitalized two years ago for pneumonia and made a complete recovery. Mrs. A. also suffers from anxiety and has had a few panic attacks in the past year  triggered by stressful events  such as her husband's death.  Family History:  Her family history indicates that her father had been diagnosed with a myocardial infarction in his early sixties and passed away from a stroke at the age of 78. Her mother lived into her eighties and died from complications of Alzheimer's disease. Her older brother has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease and is currently managing the condition with medication.   Review of Systems:  Mrs. A. currently complains of fatigue and weakness  alongside her chest pain. She also reports a recent increase in dyspnea on exertion and occasional lightheadedness.    Investigations:  Initial investigations revealed elevated cardiac enzymes. An EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  but a subsequent coronary angiogram showed no obstructive coronary disease. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated apical ballooning and a reduced ejection fraction of about 30%. The absence of significant stenosis on the angiogram in the setting of ST-segment changes on EKG and reduced heart function led to a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment:  Mrs. A has been given supportive treatment with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and diuretics to manage symptoms of heart failure.   Final Notes:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is associated with emotional and physical stress  and given Mrs. A’s past history with anxiety and recent stressful events  an increase in her anxiety management care is required to prevent future events. Psychotherapy and potential adjustment of her medications for anxiety may be beneficial as part of her long-term management strategy."
15,9,24,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial24,Patient Case Presentation:   Patient Profile: - Name: Mrs. Helen Green - Age: 65 years  - Gender: Female  - Occupation: Retired school teacher  - Home address: Silver Springs Retirement Community  Charlotte  North Carolina  Presenting Symptoms: The patient arrived at the hospital complaining of sudden  severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. She also reported a history of palpitations and shortness of breath initiated on the same day while she was attending a family ceremony.    Past Medical History: Mrs. Green has hypertension  controlled by losartan and hydrochlorothiazide  diagnosed 7 years ago. She mentions she has been inconsistent with her medications due to periodic bouts of depression since her husband's death two years ago.   Demographic Information: She drinks alcohol occasionally and has never smoked. She maintains a fair diet and tries to have a walk every day.   Family History: Her mother passed away at the age of 70 due to myocardial infarction. She has an older sibling living with type-2 diabetes mellitus.  Investigations: At the emergency department  her ECG showed ST-segment elevation  and her troponin was elevated as well  which typically indicates a heart attack  but subsequent angiography ruled out blockage in her coronary arteries. Echocardiography revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle  a distinctive feature not typically seen in heart attacks.   Diagnosis: Considering the acute stress event she experienced (family ceremony)  the raised cardiac enzymes  distinctive echocardiographic features  and the absence of major coronary artery disease  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) was made.  Management: Mrs. Green was started on beta-blockers (metoprolol) and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (lisinopril)  and her existing medication for hypertension was continued. She was also referred to a psychologist for her depression.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a stress-induced (“broken heart”) syndrome that imitates acute coronary syndrome. Although the exact cause is unknown  it's thought that a surge of stress hormones stuns the heart  causing changes in heart muscles and blood vessels. Cardiovascular risk factors  family history of heart disease  and mental health are important aspects to consider. The case of Mrs. Green emphasizes the need for holistic management addressing both physiological and psychological health.   Prognosis:  The majority of people recover with appropriate treatment  and the heart muscle typically regains normal function. In Mrs. Green's case  regular follow-ups  both physical and psychological  are necessary to ensure proper recovery and prevention of recurrence.
15,9,25,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial25,Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Postmenopausal Woman Triggered by Unexpected Grief  Case Presentation:  Patient A.B.  a 72-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain and dyspnea. These symptoms were found to occur shortly after the patient learnt about the sudden demise of her close friend  which she admitted caused her significant emotional distress. She also disclosed a recent increase in her alcohol consumption due to her feeling distressed and anxious.  Medical history/Social history: Patient A.B. had been reasonably controlling her hypertension and diabetes over the last 15 years with a combination of ACE inhibitors and Metformin. She had never smoked and led a diligent life dedicated to aerobics and a healthy diet until her husband died three years ago  which since then has led her to neglect her physical health somewhat.  Family History: Both parents had coronary artery disease with her father suffering a myocardial infarction at the age of 67. Moreover  her elder sister was diagnosed with congestive heart failure.   Her physical examination revealed an elevated heart rate (105 beats/minute)  increased respiratory rate (22 breaths/minute) and an elevated blood pressure (150/90 mmHg). Lab tests showed slightly elevated levels of cardiac troponin. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  and the subsequent emergency coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease  allowing us to rule out an acute coronary syndrome.  Upon performing an echocardiography  it revealed the characteristic finding of an apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesis  indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The results correlated with the patient's acute emotional distress  leading us to the conclusion of a Takotsubo Syndrome receding the sudden emotional trauma.  Treatment: Patient A.B. was given aspirin  angiotensin receptor blockers and a beta-blocker. She was also referred to a grief counselor to manage her emotional distress and was given advice on reducing alcohol consumption. She responded well to the treatment and gradually her cardiac function began to improve.  Conclusion: Even though Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a relatively rare condition that mimics an acute coronary syndrome  it presents a clear link to emotional triggers  reinforcing the strong connection between mental and cardiac health. This case brings forth the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with chest symptoms following severe emotional distress  even more so in postmenopausal women  a demographic especially vulnerable to this condition.
15,9,26,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial26,Patient Case Presentation:  Patient Information: Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female presenting today in the Emergency Department with complaints of acute chest pain. The patient lives independently and has a history of anxiety and depression. She is a lifelong nonsmoker  and her alcohol consumption is low to moderate.  Past Medical History: She was previously diagnosed with hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and mild osteoporosis. She received treatment accordingly for these conditions and has regular follow-ups at the outpatient clinic. She has no known allergies to any medication.  Family History: Her mother died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 72 years and the deceased father had a history of stroke and diabetes mellitus. She has one older sister who has hypertension and one younger brother alive and well.  Presenting Complaint: The patient was found weeping and clutching her chest  following a heated argument with her sister. She described an intense chest pain radiating to her left shoulder and arm.  Investigation: On physical examination  the patient was in obvious distress  slightly sweaty  but not hypotensive. An ECG showed moderate ST-segment elevation in anterior leads. Troponin T levels were moderately elevated. An emergent coronary arteriography was conducted which surprisingly showed no significant stenosis or clot. However  left ventriculography demonstrated apical akinesis and ballooning with hypercontractile or normal basal segments  which is consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Course of Treatment: The patient was treated with aspirin  Beta-blockers  and ACE inhibitors  and the anginal pain subsided considerably over the next 24 hours. Transthoracic echocardiogram repeated after ten days showed complete resolution of wall-motion abnormalities.  Diagnosis: She was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as ‘broken-heart syndrome’. It is believed that her condition was precipitated by severe stress related to a family dispute.  Discharge and Follow up: Upon discharge  patient was prescribed with heart medications. Her family was made aware of the need for the patient to avoid stressful situations. She continues outpatient psychological therapy for her anxiety and depression. She will return in two weeks for an outpatient visit to assess how she is dealing emotionally and physically  and to monitor any potential recurrence of her symptoms.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in post-menopausal women presenting with symptoms similar to acute coronary syndrome  particularly in the context of acute emotional stress.
15,9,27,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial27,Patient Case Presentation: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Description: Mrs. W is a 68-year-old African American female  retired  who lives with her elderly husband. She has two adult children and three grandchildren. Mrs. W was a former smoker but quit 20 years ago. She also used to drink alcohol moderately but stopped about 15 years ago.   Past Medical History: Mrs. W was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago  which has been managed with medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily). She has no history of diabetes mellitus  coronary artery disease  or strokes. She was previously treated for depression following the death of her mother seven years ago which was managed through therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Sertraline 50mg/day). However  she was reported to have stopped her anti-depressant medication about 2 years ago  stating she felt better and didn't need them anymore.  Family History: The patient’s father had coronary artery disease and passed away at 78 due to myocardial infarction. Her mother lived to age 96 and had her health issues in old age (osteoarthritis and hypertension) managed well. None of her siblings have a history of cardiac ailments except for a sister who has hypertension.  Current Presentation:  Mrs. W presented to the Emergency Department with severe chest pain and dyspnea that started after she received the news of her eldest son's sudden death in a car accident. On examination  her vitals were: BP: 150/90 mmHg  HR: 110 bpm  RR: 22 breaths/min  Temp: 37.8°C  SpO2: 93% on room air. The ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  and her Troponin I levels were raised. However  coronary angiography showed non-obstructive coronary artery disease.   Echocardiogram was performed which demonstrated the classic 'apical ballooning' indicative of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. She was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (AKA Broken Heart Syndrome) likely induced by severe emotional stress. The diagnosis was definitive since she met the modified Mayo Clinic criteria for the disease.  Management: She was admitted to the cardiac care unit and treated with aspirin  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and statins. Counseling was incorporated into her care plan due to the precipitating emotional stress. Her condition gradually improved and she was weaned off from her supportive treatment. She was discharged after 10 days and advised regular follow-up with cardiology and psychotherapy sessions to help cope with her son's death.  This case study emphasizes the vital connection between psychological stress and cardiovascular diseases. Emotionally triggered Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is a unique cardiac condition that necessitates a multidisciplinary approach in the management of patient care. Continued research will hopefully provide more definitive care routes for this distinct patient population.
15,9,28,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial28,Subject: Case Presentation - Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile: The patient  Mrs. Julia Clark  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  was recently admitted to our facility. She is a retired school teacher  living on her own  with two adult children.   Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Clark was rushed to the emergency department after suffering from acute chest pain and shortness of breath. She reported experiencing these symptoms for the past 2 hours.   Past Medical History (PMH): Mrs. Clark is known to have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  for which she has been on medication (Metformin 500mg twice a day) for the last 10 years. She is also fortuitously hypertensive since the last five years  controlled on Losartan potassium (50mg/day). There is no previous history of any major surgeries  injuries  or hospitalizations.   Family History: Both her parents had cardiac issues. Her father died at age 72 due to myocardial infarction and her mother had a history of hypertension but lived till age 80. Her elder brother has undergone angioplasty at the age of 62.  Current Clinical Findings: On clinical examination  her pulse rate was 85 beats per minute  blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg. Her respiration rate was slightly high  at 23 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation was 96%. The cardiac examination revealed a regular rhythm without murmurs.   Diagnostic Findings: Her ECG findings displayed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Cardiac biomarkers were mildly elevated. Upon performing an echocardiogram  it demonstrated an ‘apical ballooning’ with the basal segment of the left ventricle showing normal or hyper contractility  correlating with the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Treatment & Prognosis: Mrs. Clark has been started on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics to control the symptoms and prevent left ventricular remodeling. The prognosis is typically good  with most patients showing complete recovery within a few weeks. However  considering her history of diabetes and hypertension  careful monitoring and control of these aspects will also be needed.  Psychosocial Context: It is important to note that these symptoms started precisely after she received news of her younger son's sudden death  pointing to the fact that emotional stress acted as an inciting incident leading to her present condition. She has been directed to counseling and support to help her navigate this loss.   This case exhibits the classic presentation of Takotsubo or 'broken heart' syndrome  emphasizing the tangible impact of emotional distress on cardiac function  especially in individuals with other predisposing factors such as diabetes and hypertension. Regular follow-ups are advised.
15,9,29,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial29,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Jane Doe Age: 63 Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  Presenting Concern:  Mrs. Doe presented with severe chest pain and extreme fatigue that started a few hours ago after learning about the sudden death of her lifelong friend. She reports having felt a significant emotional shock and describes the pain as sharp and consistent  radiating to her left arm and shoulder.   Pas Medical History:  Mrs. Doe has a history of well-controlled hypertension and is on regular medication. She has had no previous related cardiac issues  surgeries  or allergies. Her most recent blood work was done six months ago  and all her parameters were within the normal range. She has momentary spikes in blood pressure due to stress  which are managed by lifestyle modifications.  Family History:  Her mother underwent bypass surgery at the age of 75  and her father died in his early 60s due to a heart attack. Her sister was recently diagnosed with diabetes. Other than these  there is no significant hereditary disease in the family.   Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  she was found to be hypotensive (BP: 80/60mmHg) and tachycardic (HR: 102bpm). Initial ECG indicated ST-elevation in anterior-lateral leads with slight T-wave inversion  suggestive of a heart attack. However  blood tests showed normal levels of cardiac biomarkers (Troponin I  CK-MB)  contradicting a heart attack. Echocardiography was performed  showing apical ballooning of the left ventricle with strong hyperkinesis of the basal walls – a characteristic feature of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Treatment and Patient Care:  Mrs. Doe was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome) and treated in the intensive care unit. Given the stress-triggered onset  she was started on beta-blockers (Metoprolol)  ACE inhibitors (Lisinopril)  and diuretics (Furosemide) to manage blood pressure and minimize myocardial stress. Psychological counseling was advised to tackle extreme emotional stress  which likely contributed to this condition.   Concluding Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a reversible condition with a good prognosis if recognized and managed promptly. The patient's emotional stress needs to be addressed to prevent recurrence effectively. Long-term follow-up with a cardiologist is advised to monitor patient progress and any alterations in cardiac function.
15,9,30,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial30,CASE PRESENTATION:  Patient Information: A 65-year-old Asian woman presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and a transient loss of consciousness. She was an active woman who used to exercise three times a week with no past history of cardiovascular or any systemic disease. Her only medication was oral hormone replacement therapy.  Presenting Complaint: The patient described the pain as severe  sharp  radiating to the left shoulder and jaw  and aggravated by breathing  suggestive of anginal pain. The onset was sudden while she was relaxing at home  several hours after hearing about the unexpected death of her grandson.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  her blood pressure was 130/73 mm Hg  pulse was 100 beats/min  temperature was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit  and respiratory rate was 15 breaths/min. Her oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm without murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Oxygen saturation was 98%.  Past Medical History: An in-depth exploration revealed that the patient had been healthy her entire life apart from a hysterectomy 20 years ago due to severe uterine fibroids. She did not have any chronic diseases like diabetes  hypertension  or dyslipidemia.   Family History: The patient’s family history revealed no inherited heart diseases  diabetes  or other significant conditions. Both parents lived until their 90s and passed away due to non-cardiac-related diseases. She has three healthy children in their 30s.  Investigations/Laboratory Results: Her EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads and an elevated Troponin T level of 0.5 ng/ml. Echocardiography revealed apical ballooning with hypercontraction of the basal segments  compatible with a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management: The patient was treated with supportive care that included ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. She was monitored for any complications  primarily left ventricular outflow tract obstruction  left ventricular mural thrombus formation  and arrhythmias.  Prognosis: The prognosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally favorable. However  the patient was advised to avoid intense emotional stressors  where possible  as they can precipitate episodes. She demonstrated good progress during the initial admission and was scheduled for a follow-up after one month.  Notes/Plan: Psychotherapy was recommended to manage her grief and loss  and to potentially help prevent symptoms caused by emotional stress. The patient was also advised to maintain a balanced diet and to continue with her regular exercise program.    This case demonstrates the role of intense emotional triggers in takotsubo cardiomyopathy development  often known as broken heart syndrome - given its close association with acute emotional distress.  References:  Not available.   I certify that I have seen the patient  have reviewed the examination  and agree with the details discussed in this case presentation.
15,9,31,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial31,Patient Presentation: Mrs. J is a 72-year-old Caucasian female with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism  presenting to the emergency department following a sudden episode of chest pain and shortness of breath that began shortly after learning of her daughter's unexpected passing.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. J has a known history of hypertension  for which she takes a low dose Lisinopril  and hypothyroidism  well managed with Levothyroxine. She had a successful hip replacement surgery 3-years prior. She had never been previously diagnosed with any cardiac diseases.  Family History:  There is a significant family history of cardiac disease; her father died of myocardial infarction at age 62  and her older brother has been recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure at age 75.  Social History:  Mrs. J is a widow for 10 years and lives alone but has a supportive network of friends and family. She has never smoked or consumed alcohol. She takes part in water aerobics twice a week.  Presentation:  Mrs. J presented at the emergency department with sudden onset  severe subsided chest pain  shortness of breath following her daughter's sudden death. The patient reported the pain as 'crushing ' radiating down her left arm. There were no associated symptoms such as nausea or fainting.  Investigations: Initial EKG showed slight ST-segment elevation. Blood tests revealed a moderate elevation of cardiac Troponin levels. Due to her symptoms and test results  Mrs. J was treated assuming acute coronary syndrome. A coronary angiography was immediately performed but showed no significant blockages. The left ventricular angiography showed apical ballooning consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Diagnosis: Considering Mrs. J’s clinical presentation  her elevated cardiac enzymes  the characteristic apical ballooning of the left ventricle on angiography  and the absence of obstructive coronary disease on catheterization  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy was made.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken-heart syndrome  typically presents with chest pain and EKG changes mimicking a heart attack. Contrary to a heart attack  however  this temporary condition often follows severe emotional stress and does not involve the coronary arteries. The heart's main pumping chamber — the left ventricle — changes shape  affecting its ability to pump blood effectively.  Management: The immediate management revolved around supportive care  pharmacological therapies which included ACE inhibitors  β-blockers  and diuretics as needed. The patient showed significant improvement with this approach. Counseling and stress management strategies were also part of the discharge plan considering potential emotional triggers.    Prognosis: The prognosis for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally favorable with proper management and support. The left ventricular function often returns to normal within six weeks. Most patients recover fully with low recurrence rates. However  patients like Mrs. J with a significant history of cardiovascular disease must be monitored carefully for potential complications.  This case underscores the significant influence of emotional stress on cardiac function and the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy when evaluating patients presenting with chest pain in the setting of severe emotional stress.
15,9,32,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial32,Patient Profile: Ms. R  a 61-year-old Asian female  presented to the Emergency Department complaining of severe chest discomfort. Born and raised in Japan  she relocated to the United States two years ago. Living independently  she has successfully maintained a job as a caregiver for a local elder. Her past medical history includes hypertension controlled by a low-sodium diet and regular exercise. Apart from occasional bouts of arthritis  she reported no other significant health issues. The patient’s mother suffered from heart disease and passed away at the age of 68 from a myocardial infarction. Additionally  her father is known to have Type II diabetes. Apart from medication allergies  Ms. R smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day for the past 25 years but quit 5 years ago. She admits to moderate alcohol consumption.  Presenting Complaint: Ms. R arrived at the ER after experiencing sudden  intense chest pain onset while at work. It was described as a heavy pressure sensation accompanied by shortness of breath. She reported that she felt nauseated and had one episode of vomiting. The pain did not dissipate with rest and did not radiate to any other part of her body.  Examination and Investigations: Her blood pressure on arrival was 150/95 mmHg with a pulse of 115 bpm. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads  suggestive of an anterior wall myocardial infarction (MI). However  subsequent angiography ruled out a myocardial infarction as no blockages were found in her coronary arteries.  Diagnosis: With the confirmation of an absence of atherosclerotic disease  the working diagnosis was Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC)  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome. Further conversations with Ms. R revealed that she had been under excessive stress due to work deadlines and the recent passing of a close friend. These emotional triggers  combined with her presenting symptoms and test results  further confirmed the diagnosis of TTC.  Treatment and Follow-Up: Ms. R was admitted to the intensive care unit for continuous monitoring and management. She was given angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics to improve her cardiac function. She responded well to the medical treatment and reported rapid alleviation of her chest discomfort over the next few days. Patient education concerning stress management and coping mechanisms was also initiated. After being discharged  follow-up appointments were scheduled with a cardiologist and hypertension specialist to ensure her recovery progress and prevent recurrence.  In conclusion  Ms. R's case provided insight into the importance of considering less frequent causes of chest discomfort. Her case underscored the link between severe emotional stressors and the onset of TTC. Her timely management and follow-up care aimed at reducing her hypertension risk and managing stress could prevent the recurrence of this condition. 
15,9,33,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial33,Patient Introduction: The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian female diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy; she initially presented to the hospital with severe chest pain after the sudden death of her husband.  Chief Complaint & History of Present Illness: She has a two-day history of acute onset chest pain radiating to her left arm  shortness of breath  palpitations  and fatigue. The pain worsens with physical activity and is relieved by rest. Her symptoms occurred following an emotional stress event – the unexpected death of her husband.  Past Medical History: Her past medical history reveals hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which she regularly takes medications (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin  respectively). She has no history of smoking  alcohol  or substance abuse. She has no known allergies.  Family History: The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease. Her father died of myocardial infarction in his sixties  and her mother suffers from diabetes and hypertension.   Physical Examination: On examination  she appears agitated and distressed. Vital signs revealed tachycardia (heart rate: 110 bpm)  high blood pressure (150/90 mmHg)  a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  SpO2 94% on room air  and a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8F). Cardiovascular exam showed increased heartbeat without murmurs. Lung sounds were clear  and the rest of the examination was normal.  Diagnostic Assessment: Initial ECG demonstrated ST-segment elevation  mimicking myocardial infarction. However  cardiac biomarkers were mildly elevated  inconsistent with the degree of ST-segment elevation. Echocardiography and left ventriculography revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle during systole with preserved basal function  a classic sign of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Cardiac catheterization ruled out any significant coronary artery disease.   Plan: The patient was managed with beta-blockers (metoprolol)  ACE-inhibitors (Lisinopril)  and anti-anxiety medications. She was monitored in the coronary care unit with continuous EKG. Upon stabilization of her symptoms  she was recommended to start a cardiac rehabilitation program and mental health counseling to better manage her stressful emotional state.   Conclusion: In conclusion  the patient's presentation of significant emotional stress  characteristic EKG changes  echocardiographic findings of apical ballooning in the absence of obstructive coronary disease  and the mild elevation of cardiac biomarkers led to her diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Emotional stress management and early detection of cardiac symptoms are vital for the patient's recovery and prevention of further cardiovascular events.
15,9,34,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial34,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 62-year-old African American female  referred to here as Mrs. U. She is an office worker and has been living in California for the past thirty years. She is married and has two adult children. Mrs. U is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol moderately. She has a past history of hypertension and high cholesterol for which she has been on medication for several years. Her mother suffered from a stroke at an old age  and her father died of a heart attack. She has no known drug allergies.  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. U reported to the emergency department experiencing shortness of breath  nausea  vomiting  and chest pain that originated in the center of her chest and spread towards her arm.  Clinical Examination: Physical examination returned normal results. Her body mass index was within normal range  and she had a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was found to be 94% on room air.  Investigations: ECG showed signs of minor ST-elevation in precordial leads  and initial troponin was raised at 2.8ng/ml. An echocardiogram revealed impaired left ventricle function with apical ballooning and akinesis of mid and apical segments  a classic appearance of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management: Mrs. U was immediately admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit and given high-dose beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors due to her high blood pressure and rapid heart rate. She was also provided with medication for her cholesterol issue.  Discussion: This case aligns with demographic studies that show that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC)  also referred to as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  is more prevalent in postmenopausal women. The specific cause of TC is unknown  but it is often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress  such as death of a loved one  a serious physical injury  or major surgery.  Possible indications of TC include elevated cardiac biomarkers  ST-segment elevation or depression on electrocardiogram  and confirmation via echocardiogram or cardiac MRI. It is essential to exclude obstructive coronary disease with angiography  as this would suggest a different diagnosis like an acute coronary syndrome.  Medical or family history of cardiac disease  as seen in Mrs. U's case  exacerbates the condition. Mrs. U requires careful monitoring and follow-ups to ensure that her heart regains normal function and to adjust medications if necessary. Supportive care  stress management  and lifestyle modifications play a crucial role in the management and possible prevention of a recurrence.
15,9,35,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial35,Patient Presentation  Mr. Gregory  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  presented to our hospital with sudden-onset chest pain. He reported feeling weak with shortness of breath and a sense of impending doom. He revealed that he had a traumatic incident earlier that day when he received the news of his brother's sudden death.  Past Medical History Mr. Gregory has a history of mild hypertension  controlled with lifestyle modifications. There is no history of smoking or recreational drug use  and there is no prior known history of cardiac disease. His medications include only a multivitamin supplement  taken as needed.  Family History Family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with Mr. Gregory's mother dying of myocardial infarction at 60 and his aforementioned brother dying suddenly at age 50  although the cause of his death is still unknown. No family history of diabetes  kidney disease  or genetic disease is reported.  Physical Examination/Investigations On examination  he was found to have an elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. His cardiac enzymes were moderately elevated  suggestive of cardiac injury. Echocardiography showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with normal function at the base  with significant reduction of ejection fraction to 40%. A coronary angiogram showed non-obstructive coronary disease  while cardiac MRI demonstrated wall motion abnormalities consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Clinical Course & Diagnosis Given his clinical presentation  ECG changes  cardiac enzyme elevations  typical echocardiographic findings  and clean coronary angiogram  a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) was made.   This stress cardiomyopathy is thought to be triggered by intense emotional or physical stress leading to a surge of adrenaline that stuns the heart  causing acute heart failure. Mr. Gregory’s cardiomyopathy was likely precipitated by the intensely stressful incident he had experienced that day.  Management & Follow-up Mr. Gregory was managed conservatively with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors to reduce stress on the heart and help restore normal function. Regular follow-up with echocardiography was scheduled to monitor his recovery. He was also advised to seek psychological support to deal with his traumatic loss.   Mr. Gregory's case emphasizes the significant impact emotional stress can have on physical health  thus highlighting the importance of managing stress and offering holistic healthcare.  
15,9,36,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial36,Patient Profile:  Ms. H is a 65-year-old Caucasian female living in a suburban community. She is retired from her teaching job and lives alone. Her husband passed away a year ago. She has two adult children living in different states. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her father died of a heart attack at the age of 70  and her mother is presently 90 years old and lives in a nursing home.  Presenting Condition:  Ms. H presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain radiating to her left arm  along with profuse sweating and a feeling of impending doom. With her symptoms and family history  doctors initially suspected acute coronary syndrome.   During the initial evaluation  her blood pressure was 150/90mm Hg  her pulse rate was 100 bpm  and her respiratory rate was 22/min. Her physical examination was essentially normal except for a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur heard over the aortic area. Her ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  and her cardiac enzymes were elevated  supporting the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.  Further Management:  She was given aspirin  nitroglycerin  and clopidogrel. Heparin was started  and she was transferred to the cardiac catheterization lab. However  coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis in the coronary arteries. On the other hand  ventriculography showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken-heart syndrome). Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed this diagnosis  showing hypokinesis of the apical and middle segments of the left ventricle with preserved function at the base.  The patient was started on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. Counselling was also initiated due to her recent emotional stress. She also attended sessions with a psychologist to discuss her emotional distress.  Outcome:  Ms. H's chest pain resolved over a couple of days  and she was discharged on beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and aspirin. A follow-up appointment after two weeks showed substantial improvement in her left ventricle function and reduction of her symptoms. She was encouraged to continue her psychological counselling.  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  often occurs after emotional or physical stress. Symptoms mimic those of a heart attack  including chest pain and difficulty breathing. The definitive diagnosis comes through a comprehensive evaluation  including coronary angiography and ventriculography. Management revolves around alleviating symptoms  treating heart failure and  most importantly  addressing the precipitating stress. Patients generally show substantial improvement with the right treatment approach and stress management.
15,9,37,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial37,Patient Presentation:  Patient X is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who lives alone in her community in downtown Boston. The patient is a retired nurse with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidopathy. She has no known history of cardiovascular disease  and to her current knowledge  no family history of heart disease.  Presenting Issue:  The patient presented to the ER with severe chest pain accompanied by shortness of breath  palpitations  and dizziness. These symptoms were precipitated by a sudden and intense argument with a family member over the phone. She described the pain as a crushing pressure  similar to her hypertensive crises in terms of intensity but distinct in nature.   Emergency Department Assessment:  On presentation  her blood pressure was high  reaching readings of up to 180/100 mm HG. Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Her troponin levels were also significantly raised. A prompt evaluation led to the suspicion of an acute myocardial infarction. Given her chest pain history  she was immediately referred to the catheterization lab for a possible percutaneous coronary intervention.   Invasive Coronary Angiogram:  Invasive angiography  however  did not reveal any significant coronary artery disease that would justify her symptoms and the elevated cardiac biomarkers. The left ventricular angiogram  on the other hand  exhibited apical ballooning and hypercontractile basal segments consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment:  She was promptly treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers to manage her symptoms and prevent potential complications. The use of anticoagulants also helped to prevent possible left ventricular thrombus formation.   Hospital Course and Outcome:  During her stay in the hospital  her cardiac enzymes returned to normal  and her symptom gradually improved. Repeat echocardiography a week later showed significant improvement in her left ventricular function.  Diagnosis:  Based on these findings and the emotional stress that preceded her chest pain  albeit in the absence of significant coronary artery disease  Patient X was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Follow-Up:   Patient X was discharged with a prescription for ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  aspirin  and statins. She was also advised to enlist into stress management and heart-healthy education programs. She was scheduled for close follow-up in outpatient cardiology  with regular monitoring of her blood pressure  cholesterol levels  and therapeutic regimen assessments.
15,9,38,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial38,Patient Profile:  Ms. A is a 68-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of controlled hypertension and no other notable prior medical conditions. She resides with her family in San Antonio  Texas  and usually enjoys a socially active life. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She has no known allergies and her family history does not show any significant genetic disorder or risk factors that could contribute to her present condition. She is a widow  her husband died two years ago.  Presenting Complaint:  Ms. A presents to the Emergency Department complaining of acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath  without radiation  that began while she was having an intense argument with her son. She rates her pain as 8/10  located in the substernal region  and describes it as a squeezing type of pain.  Examination and Tests:  On examination  she appears anxious and in pain. Her Blood Pressure was 160/95 mmHg  Heart Rate 110 bpm  and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Chest auscultation revealed no abnormal heart sounds and clear lungs. EKG demonstrated ST elevation in the anterior leads. An emergent echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved basal function  indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Hospital Course:  She was admitted into the hospital for monitoring and treatment. Her cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated but there was no evidence of blocked coronary arteries on the coronary angiogram done. Her chest pain improved with analgesic and anxiety management while her heart function gradually began to improve.  Diagnosis:  Based on Ms. A's presenting symptoms  physical exam  EKG changes  echocardiographic findings  and the context of significant emotional stress  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Treatment:  Ms. A was managed with beta-blockers for blood pressure control and to reduce myocardial oxygen demand  ACE inhibitors for myocardial remodeling  aspirin  and supportive care. She was referred for grief counseling and management of psychosocial stressors.  Prognosis:  Overall  her prognosis is good given the typically reversible nature of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  although there is a risk for recurrence. Lifestyle modifications  stress management  and mental health counseling were advised to contribute to better outcomes for Ms. A.  Conclusion:  Ms. A's case underscores the importance of recognizing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  particularly in postmenopausal women presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome in the context of significant psychological stress. Early recognition and management can contribute to better outcomes. 
15,9,39,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial39,Patient Details: - Name: [Jane Doe] - Age: 64 - Sex: Female - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired school teacher  Presenting Complaint: The patient was brought to the Emergency Department complaining of severe chest pain  related to emotional distress after learning about the unexpected death of her close cousin. The pain was intense  acute  located in the middle of chest and radiating towards left arm.  Past Medical History: - No history of ischemic heart disease - Diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago; controlled on ACE inhibitors - Non-smoker and occasional consumer of alcohol - Previous history of anxiety and treated with psychotherapy and anxiolytics  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient looked anxious with a BP reading of 150/90mmHg  HR:100 bpm  RR: 20 breaths per min  Oxygen Saturation: 97% at room air. The cardiovascular examination revealed no abnormalities. Overall  her physical health was relatively good  considering her age.  Investigations: ECG examination was suggestive of ST elevation in anterior leads. Cardiac enzymes (Troponin T) were elevated. An emergency coronary angiography was therefore performed. It showed no significant blockages in the coronary arteries. An echocardiogram was performed which revealed apical ballooning of the ventricle  with base of the ventricle contracting normally  creating the shape akin to a Japanese octopus trap (takotsubo)  which led to a diagnosis of Takotsubo (stress-induced) cardiomyopathy.  Course of Treatment: The patient was treated with supportive care consisting of low-dose aspirin  beta-blockers  and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors). She was also placed on a mild sedative to help her deal with her anxiety and sleep.  Family History: No noteworthy genetic diseases. Both parents deceased due to old age-related illnesses. She has a younger brother diagnosed with type II diabetes and hypertension.  Follow up: Patient was followed up after 6 weeks. She was feeling better  her blood pressure was back to normal and chest pain was gone. Her follow up echocardiogram showed a resolution of the previous changes indicating a return to her normal cardiac function.  Outcome: The patient recovered fully from the Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Emotional counseling was recommended to assist with her anxiety and stress related to her loss. It was advised she maintain a balanced diet  regular exercise and continue medications for hypertension.   This case illustrates the classic presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly known as 'broken heart syndrome'  where intense emotional or physical stress leads to severe  but often reversible  myocardial dysfunction. It underlines the importance of a thorough investigation in patients presenting with chest pain and apparent myocardial infarction.
15,9,40,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial40,Subject: 62-Year-Old Female  Recently Diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile:  Name: J.D. Gender: Female Age: 62 years Race: African American Occupation: Retired school teacher  Presenting Symptom:  The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain  shortness of breath  lightheadedness  and nausea. These symptoms had begun suddenly after she received news of her brother's sudden demise.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes  both of which are well-controlled with medication. She is a nonsmoker and takes prophylactic aspirin due to a family history of heart disease. She is also on metformin for her diabetes and takes amlodipine for her hypertension. She has maintained a good diet and healthy weight throughout her life  decreasing her chances of cardiovascular disease.   Family History:  The patient's father had died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 56  and the patient's mother died of breast cancer at 70. Her older brother  recently deceased  suffered from chronic heart failure.   Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  the patient is tachycardic with a heart rate of 120 bpm. Her blood pressure measures 140/95 mmHg. EKG shows ST segment elevation  prompting immediate concern for acute myocardial infarction. The thorough lab tests  including cardiac biomarker levels  were performed  showing slightly elevated troponin levels.  Diagnostic Assessment:   Despite the initial EKG findings pointing towards an acute myocardial infarction  coronary angiography revealed no significant blockages in the coronary arteries. Left ventriculography  however  demonstrated the classic apical ballooning appearance of the left ventricle  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Treatment:  The patient was started on beta-blockers (metoprolol)  ACE inhibitors (lisinopril)  and provided with support for anxiety management through the help of a clinical psychologist.   Prognosis:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy generally has a good prognosis with appropriate management. As the patient's other health conditions––hypertension  diabetes  and her psychological stress––are being managed simultaneously  a favorable outcome is anticipated.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the potential role of acute emotional stress in the pathogenesis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It is vital for clinicians to distinguish this condition from more common causes of acute chest pain  such as acute coronary syndrome  to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and to ensure appropriate patient care. The research into the long-term effects of takotsubo cardiomyopathy continues; however  early diagnosis coupled with the careful management of associated conditions can contribute greatly to improved patient survival and quality of life.
15,9,41,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial41,"Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Southwick  a 65-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of chest pain which radiated to her left arm. The pain started suddenly after she received the news of her son's unexpected death. She describes the chest pain as heaviness in chest associated with shortness of breath  but no palpitations or loss of consciousness.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Southwick’s past medical history is significant for hypertension  which is managed with Lisinopril 10 mg daily. She does not have any previous history of heart disease  diabetes  or any other major illness. She also doesn't smoke or consume alcohol on a regular basis. She lives independently at home  with her husband.   Family History:  She has a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Her father had a myocardial infarction (MI) at the age of 70  and her brother was diagnosed with CAD at the age of 45.   ED Course and Initial Evaluation:   On initial evaluation  her vitals included blood pressure of 160/90  heart rate of 110 bpm  temperature of 98.6 F  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Physical exam revealed distress due to pain but no other abnormal findings such as murmurs  jugular venous distention or lower extremity edema.  Initial laboratory findings revealed elevated cardiac biomarkers (Troponin I - 1.5 ng/mL) and ECG demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. Given the clinical presentation and ECG changes  she was initially managed as acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However  emergent coronary angiography demonstrated no significant coronary artery disease but the left ventriculogram showed apical ballooning with reduced ejection fraction of 40% consistent with the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment and Outcome:  She was managed with supportive treatment including pain control  beta blockers  oxygen support and anticoagulation. The psychological stress was addressed with a support network and referral for supportive counseling. She was discharged in stable condition on medications including beta blockers to follow up with cardiology in 1 week and scheduled for outpatient echocardiogram in 1 month.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" typically presents in postmenopausal women and can be triggered by intense emotional or physiological stress. Despite severe presentation  the prognosis is usually good if supportive treatment is provided promptly. Offering psychological support and reassessing cardiovascular risk factors should also be considered in the care plan."
15,9,42,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial42,Patient Information:  Mrs. Elizabeth Moore  a 62-year-old Caucasian female  resident of Seattle  Washington  arrived at the emergency room of our hospital. She is a retired school teacher  married and a mother to two adult children. Mrs. Moore visited the outpatient department complaining of acute chest pain and shortness of breath.   Past Medical History:  Her past medical history includes controlling hypertension and hyperlipidemia with oral medications. She also has osteoporosis and had experienced menopausal symptoms early. Mrs. Moore is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks white wine. There have been no major surgeries in the past.   Family History:  Mrs. Moore's family history reveals that her father died at the age of 70 due to myocardial infarction. Her mother  aged 85  suffers from Type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Present Illness:  On arrival  Mrs. Moore appeared anxious and distressed. Her blood pressure was 170/90 mm Hg  pulse 100/min regular  respiratory rate 22/min  and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads compatible with an anterior wall myocardial infarction. Urgent coronary angiography showed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease.  Upon admission  it was disclosed that Mrs. Moore had recently lost her beloved pet dog  which caused her great emotional distress. Following further diagnostic evaluation  including echocardiogram and cardiac MRI  she was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy or ‘broken heart syndrome’. The condition was characterized by apical ballooning and hyperkinesis of the basal walls  reflecting the typical features of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management and Outcome: Mrs. Moore was managed conservatively with support from beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and reassurance. In addition  she was offered consultation with a clinical psychologist to help cope with her emotional distress. Upon follow-up one month later  Mrs. Moore reported a significant improvement in symptoms  and repeat echocardiogram showed a complete resolution of left ventricular dysfunction.  This case illuminates the potential impact of acute emotional stress leading to takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Clinicians should always maintain a high level of suspicion in elderly women presenting with chest pain  especially those who have recently experienced emotional distress.
15,9,43,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial43,Patient Information:  Name: Mrs. Jane Doe Age: 61 years Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Chief Complaint:  Chest pain and shortness of breath  History of Present Illness:  The patient initially presented to the emergency department with one day of severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started after an emotional stressor - the sudden death of a relative. There is no history of fever  cough  orthopnea  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.   Past Medical History:  No documented history of cardiovascular disease  diabetes mellitus  hypertension  or hyperlipidemia. The patient is a non-smoker and maintains an active lifestyle. She is not on any chronic medications and has no known allergies.  Family History:  There is no family history of early-onset heart disease among first-degree relatives.   Physical Examination:  On examination  vital signs reveal blood pressure 130/85 mmHg  heart rate 110 bpm  temperature 98.6 °F  respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia  normal S1 & S2 with no additional heart sounds or murmurs. Pulmonary examination is unremarkable  with no evidence of rales or wheezing. Other physical examination findings were within normal limits.  Investigations:  An EKG was performed and showed ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads and ejection fraction (EF) was found to be 45%. Coronary angiography revealed no signs of significant stenosis. Lab findings demonstrated increased Troponin I levels.   Diagnosis:  The patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy based on the clinical presentation  significantly elevated troponin level  transient wall-motion abnormalities noted on the echocardiogram  and lack of significant findings on coronary angiography.  Management:  Treatment with aspirin  beta-blockers  and ACE inhibitors was initiated. Emotional/stress management counseling was also arranged given the association of her symptoms with a significant emotional event.   Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a temporary heart condition often triggered by extreme stress. Also known as broken heart syndrome  it presents similar to acute coronary syndrome. The distinction is typically made through coronary angiography  which is unremarkable in Takotsubo  and specific wall-motion abnormalities seen on echo. Treatment is supportive  focusing on symptom relief and stress management. It's notable that the patient had no history of heart disease and maintained an active lifestyle.  Follow-Up:  The patient will have a follow-up appointment in one month and then every three months thereafter. She also has been referred to a mental health professional for assistance with stress and grief management.

Clinical Findings:  On examination  her heart rate was 110 beats per minute  blood pressure was 145/85 mmHg  and she was afebrile. Cardiac auscultation revealed an 'S3' Gallop and EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads.  Investigations: Cardiac markers  Troponin I levels were significantly elevated. However  the coronary angiogram showed no evidence of atherosclerotic disease. Echocardiography showed a dilated and hypo-kinetic distal left ventricle with hyperactive basal contraction  a pattern suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Diagnosis: Based on the typical emotional trigger  characteristic EKG and echocardiography findings  a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made.  Management Plan: The patient was initially managed with standard acute heart failure treatment which comprised oxygen  aspirin  low-molecular-weight heparin  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. Since she was in emotional distress  a consultation with a psychologist was arranged.   Prognosis: Considering her relatively good health before the incident and the absence of complicating diseases  her prognosis of recovery within weeks to months is good  although she will need follow-up appointments to monitor her recovery and adjust treatment accordingly.   Additional Points for Medical Staff: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is often misdiagnosed as acute coronary syndrome because of the similarity in presentation. This case emphasizes the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes  especially if they report any emotional or physical stressors.

She was subsequently sent for an echocardiogram  which demonstrated left ventricular dyskinesia with apical ballooning. Coronary angiography found no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease.  Diagnosis: With the combination of clinical presentations  biochemical results  ECG changes  and typical echocardiogram findings  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome).  Treatment Plan: She was given aspirin  a beta-blocker  an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor  and anticoagulants. Besides  the patient was counseled for stress management and recommended for cardiology follow-ups.  Educational Context: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a temporary heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations  such as death of a loved one.
15,9,46,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial46,Title: A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a 58-year-old Female  Patient Presentation The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian female. She is a retired teacher living in an urban area with her husband. There is no history of smoking  alcohol abuse  or drug use. She is 168 cm tall and weighs 70 kg.  Past Medical History Past medical history is significant for hypertension  which she has been managing for almost a decade  and type II diabetes  diagnosed 5 years back - both effectively managed with prescribed medications. She has no history of previous myocardial infarcts  and there is no known history of any psychiatric disorders  including anxiety or depression.  Presenting Complaint The patient presented with severe acute chest pain  irregular heartbeat and dyspnea  beginning approximately 2 hours before presentation. Symptoms started suddenly and have persisted since onset. There was no history of fever  cough  edema or recent respiratory tract infection.   Family History The patient's family medical history reveals that her mother died of myocardial infarction in her late 60s and had diabetes. Her father had hypertension and died at 85 due to prostate cancer. She has two brothers; one had a stroke at late 50s  and the other is diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes.   Investigations and Results A series of investigations were conducted and the following results were obtained:  Bright Enhancement and Late Gadolinium Enhancement evaluation did not show any evidence of myocardial infarction. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed new ST-segment elevation in precordial leads. Troponin I levels were markedly increased. Complete blood count  electrolytes  renal function  liver function  lipid profile  and glucose levels were within normal range. Coronary angiography showed minimal coronary artery disease not sufficient to explain the myocardial function. Left ventriculography showed a characteristic pattern of apical ballooning with preserved function of the basal segments suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Treatment and Recovery  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) and managed with aspirin  low molecular weight heparin  nitrates and ACE inhibitors. Psychological support was provided to the patient  as anxiety and stress are often associated with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Convalescence was uneventful with the patient showing signs of improvement within 72 hours. Follow-up echocardiography after 2 weeks demonstrated complete normalization of the left ventricle function. Patient will continue management of hypertension and diabetes  with additional cardiac function monitoring and regular follow-ups.  Conclusions This case illustrates that even without traditional risk factors  such as a significant coronary artery disease  patients can still present with severe symptoms and signs of cardiovascular disease  which may be due to takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Appropriate evaluation and diagnosis will ensure proper treatment and prevent further unnecessary invasive procedures.
15,9,47,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial47,Patient Profile: Our patient  Ms. Elena Sanchez  is a 62-year-old female from Hispanic ethnicity. She is a widowed individual who lives alone in a suburban neighborhood of Modesto  California. She is a non-smoker  non-alcoholic and moderately active in her lifestyle. Elena works as a high-school teacher and has recently been experiencing significant work-related stress.  Presenting Complaint: Ms. Sanchez presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  dyspnea and nausea that started after she received stressful news related to her work. The pain was described as tightness originating in the left side of her torso and radiating into her left arm and neck.  Medical History: Her past medical history is notable for hypertension which is largely controlled under medication (Losartan 50mg once a day). She has no history of diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  renal disease  or any other significant medical illness.  Family History: Her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease; her father had myocardial infarction at the age of 65 and died of a subsequent heart failure at 70. Elena's mother suffered from diabetes and hypertension  and her elder brother is currently living with coronary artery disease.   Clinical Findings and Diagnostic Tests: Physical examination showed normal jugular venous pressure  bilateral clear lung fields  regular heart rate  rhythm  and no murmurs. EKG showed ST-segment elevations. The cardiac troponin level was found to be elevated. Coronary angiogram showed no significant obstructions  but ventriculogram displayed a characteristic apical ballooning and impaired systolic function with apical dyskinesis and basal hyperkinesis  typical of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Diagnosis: Based on the clinical findings  the patient's symptom profile  history of intense stress  and the presenting EKG changes  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) was made.   Management: Ms. Sanchez was treated conservatively with aspirin  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and beta-blockers. Psychotherapy was also suggested to help manage her stress levels. She responded well to the treatment  and her heart function progressively returned to normal over a period of about 6 weeks.  Discussion: TC is a transient heart condition often precipitated by severe emotional distress. The presentation often mimics acute coronary syndrome  but there is an absence of obstructive coronary disease. The prognosis is generally excellent with supportive therapy. Elena's risk factors include her age  gender (post-menopausal women are at higher risk)  and chronic hypertension. Proper stress management  monitoring of blood pressure  regular check-ups for heart function and psychotherapy to deal with stressful events is key in preventing any potential recurrence of TC.  The importance of understanding emotional wellbeing and its impact on physical health is strongly emphasized in this case. Stress  while being an inevitable life factor  can be managed effectively to reduce the impact on health outcomes.

She consumes alcohol in moderation  and denies illicit drug use.   Family History: Mother died at 72 from colon cancer; father died at 69 from myocardial infarction. Her older brother (68) alive with type II diabetes and CAD. Sister (65) alive with hypertension.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a distressed woman with cold  clammy skin. Her blood pressure was 170/95  heart rate 110 bpm  respiratory rate 25 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation 93% on room air. Cardiac auscultation revealed no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.  Laboratory findings revealed elevated troponin levels. Rest of the laboratory values  including kidney function and electrolyte balances  were within normal range.  Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and lab results  an urgent echocardiogram was carried out which revealed apical ballooning with preserved basal function with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%  suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiogram displayed non-obstructive coronary arteries  also favoring the diagnosis.   Other Details: Prior to admission  the patient had been under severe stress due to death in the family.  Management: She was treated with β-blockers  ACE inhibitors and diuretics to manage her symptoms. Slow tapering was planned over the next 6 months. A psychiatric referral was made for her depressive symptoms. She was counseled on the importance of controlling her diabetes and hypertension  stress management and regular follow-ups.  Discharge and Follow-Up: The patient was discharged home after her conditions stabilized. Ms. A was also provided with resources for stress management and a follow-up appointment for cardiac rehabilitation was scheduled. She was asked to maintain appointments with her cardiologist  endocrinologist and mental health professional.  Ms. A exemplifies the classic patient profile of an individual suffering from Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: a postmenopausal woman under severe stress. This case demonstrates the need for comprehensive medical management for patients presenting with chest pain  reviewing not only physical but also emotional wellbeing.
15,9,49,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial49,Patient Profile:  Mrs. Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian female who presented to the emergency department with severe bilateral chest pain and shortness of breath following the sudden death of her husband six hours earlier. The pain was sudden in onset and woke her from her sleep.   Medical History:  Mrs. Smith has been in good health for most of her life. She has struggled with hypertension and type 2 diabetes for the past 10 years and both are well-managed on medication. Her only other health issues were an appendectomy at the age of 25 and a natural childbirth at age 32. She has a 40-pack-year smoking history  quit 15 years ago  and drinks alcohol occasionally. She denies any recreational drug use. She has never been diagnosed with any psychiatric disorders.  Family History:  Her father died from a stroke at age 75 and her mother from breast cancer at age 78. Her younger brother has hypertension and her sister is a type 2 diabetic.  Present Illness:  A chest X-ray and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) conducted showed signs consistent with an acute anterior myocardial infarction. High sensitivity Troponin T test was significantly elevated. Attempts to relieve her symptoms with nitroglycerin were unsuccessful. Coronary angiography  however  revealed no significant stenosis or occlusions  ruling out coronary artery disease as a cause of her symptoms.  The subsequent echocardiogram displayed reduced systolic function of the left ventricle  with apical ballooning and hyperkinesis of the basal walls  known as the ‘octopus pot’ sign. These findings were suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Management and Progress:  Mrs. Smith was diagnosed with TCM  also known as ‘broken heart syndrome’  which is usually triggered by severe emotional stress. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and treatment. An initial regimen of supportive therapy was initiated  including beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The next few days showed significant improvement in terms of her symptoms.  Discussion:  This case illustrates the classic presentation of TCM  often mistaken for acute coronary syndrome. Albeit rare  TCM is an important consideration since management and prognosis significantly differs. A concrete understanding of this disease is important as it helps prevent unnecessary coronary interventions and allows for more appropriate symptomatic treatment.  Despite having some conventional risk factors - hypertension  diabetes  and former smoking - for heart disease  these were well-managed  and Mrs. Smith had no known history of heart disease prior to this episode. Her tragic emotional stressor - the death of her spouse - superseded her short-term physical health  illustrating the devastating effects of extreme emotional stress on the heart. Her case emphasizes the importance of considering TCM in older women under severe emotional distress  even when traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease are present.
15,9,50,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial50,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. Laura Klein  a 64-year-old female  Caucasian  presented to the Emergency Department with severe chest pain and dyspnea  which started suddenly two hours earlier. Ms. Klein denies any prior similar episodes or known cardiovascular diseases.   Past Medical History and Family History:  Ms. Klein has a history of well-controlled hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has no prior history of myocardial infarction  stroke  or peripheral arterial disease. Ms. Klein is a non-smoker and denies alcohol or illicit drug use.   Her family history is significant for coronary artery disease in her father  who had a myocardial infarction at age 70  and her mother had type 2 diabetes. She also has one sister who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 62.   Current Episode:  Ms. Klein's symptoms started while she was attending her eldest son's wedding. She reports extreme emotional stress throughout the event. The chest pain was described as a """"heavy"""" and """"constricting"""" sensation  and was associated with shortness of breath. She denies nausea  vomiting or palpitations.   Investigations and Diagnosis:  Initial EKG showed ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads and troponin level was found to be elevated. However  the coronary angiogram revealed no obstructive coronary artery disease  which ruled out acute myocardial infarction. Subsequent echocardiography showed apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basal walls  suggestive of takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy.  Management and Follow-Up:  Ms. Klein was managed with supportive treatment  including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and aspirin under the care of a consultant cardiologist.   Her symptoms improved over the next few days and repeat echocardiography after four weeks showed resolution of the previous abnormalities  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Ms. Klein was also referred to a psychologist to address her stress and anxiety.   Patient Education:  The patient was educated about the importance of stress management and maintaining a healthy lifestyle  including regular physical activity. She was informed about the possibility of recurrence and the necessity to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath arise in the future. Further  she was counseled to maintain consistent control of her diabetes and hypertension.   This case highlights that significant emotional stress can precipitate takotsubo cardiomyopathy  even in the absence of traditional coronary artery disease risk factors  necessitating further exploration and research in managing and understanding this unique condition.

Mrs. Bonita described the chest pain as """"crushing"""" in character and located in the center of her chest  raising the initial concern for acute myocardial infarction. The pain had begun approximately two and a half hours prior to her arrival at ED.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Bonita was a known case of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last seven years. She was on regular medication  including Angiotensin II receptor blockers and Metformin  and her blood glucose levels and blood pressure had been adequately controlled. No history of any cardiac disease was noted in the past. She had no history of smoking but did have moderate alcohol consumption. She also had a history of depression.  Family History:   Her father suffered from coronary artery disease and had undergone angioplasty at the age of 65. Her mother had a history of hypertension and diabetes. There was no known history of cardiomyopathy in her family.  Social History:   She was a divorcee and lived with her daughter. Recently  she had been under significant emotional stress due to the loss of her younger brother  to whom she was very close.  Initial Investigations:  Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed T-wave inversion with modest ST-segment elevation  suggesting an acute coronary syndrome. However  the cardiac enzyme levels were within the normal range  which was not supportive of myocardial infarction.   Hospital Course:  The patient was admitted to ICU for close monitoring and further evaluation. Echocardiography showed basal hyperkinesia with mid-ventricular and apical hypokinesia  leading to suspicion of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. After consultation with cardiology  the patient underwent coronary angiography that showed no significant atheroma ruling out a coronary artery disease. The left ventriculogram showed systolic ballooning  supporting the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was managed conservatively with a beta-blocker  ACE inhibitors and supportive care. Her chest pain alleviated with medication  and her follow-up echocardiogram showed a significant improvement in left ventricular function with reduction in apical ballooning after 6 weeks for reassessment. Her condition improved steadily  and she was counseled about stress management. Appropriate psychiatric referral was made to manage her grief reactions and underlying depression.  This presentation affirms the significant role that stress and emotional trauma can play in heart health  and it reinforces the importance of comprehensive  interdisciplinary care in managing complex health problems such as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
15,9,52,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial52,"Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mrs. M  is a 67-year-old Caucasian female with a chief complaint of chest pain reminiscent of a previous myocardial infarction felt a month prior. She reports the chest pain occurred suddenly after receiving the news of her daughter's motorcycle accident. The pain was like a """"weight was crushing her chest """" radiating to her left arm but not associated with shortness of breath.  Background:  Mrs. M has a relevant past medical history of hypertension  a condition she has managed with drugs for over six years. Her other medical histories include hyperlipidemia and a single episode of myocardial infarction a year ago. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. She reports being relatively active with a normal routine  including light cardiovascular exercise  and she maintains a balanced diet.  Upon examination  Mrs. M had an elevated blood pressure at 165/90 mmHg with a regular heart rate of 85 bpm. Her ECG demonstrated ST elevations in precordial leads V2-4. Standard blood tests revealed mildly raised Troponin I levels and slightly elevated CK-MB. The ventricular function showed an """"apical ballooning"""" pattern  and coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary disease  leading to the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Her family history revealed that Mrs. M's mother had a stroke at the age of 80 and her father passed away from heart disease. Despite this history  she regularly checks her blood pressure and cholesterol levels and had previously enjoyed good overall health with no significant medical illnesses.  Discussion:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome """" often mimics symptoms of a heart attack and is usually triggered by severe emotional or physical distress. In this case  Mrs. M's cardiomyopathy was induced by the sudden news of her daughter's serious accident.  Management:  The patient was managed with supportive care and medical management to reduce the overt cardiac stress  including ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and anticoagulants  which decreased her risk of clot formation. As the stressful trigger (daughters' accident news) was addressed  Mrs. M's chest pain gradually resolved  and a subsequent echocardiogram established the return of her normal heart function after three weeks.   In conclusion  we reported a classical case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy induced by severe emotional stress  with a unique case presentation incorporating a comprehensive account of medical and family history that confirms the stress-related triggering phenomenon. Mrs. M will continue on her prescribed medications and cardiac rehabilitation to reduce future cardiovascular risks. Education about stress management has also been advised  considering the plausible relationship with her cardiomyopathy onset."
15,9,53,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial53,Patient Information: A 67-year-old Asian female was referred to our hospital from a local clinic due to severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She is a widow and lives independently. She is a non-smoker and has no history of alcohol or drug abuse.   Medical history: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension which is controlled by medication. She is not diabetic. There is no known history of any cardiovascular disease. The patient had never experienced similar symptoms in the past.  Family history: There is a history of cardiovascular disease on her father's side  including her father who suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 60 and passed away due to a stroke at 68. Her mother died from an unknown cause at the age of 72.  Presenting complaints: She complained of suddenly developed chest pain and shortness of breath. She also reported experiencing severe emotional stress in the past few days due to the sudden death of her beloved pet.  Physical examination: On physical examination  she was alert  anxious and had pallor. Vital signs were stable. Auscultation of the heart revealed no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Lung fields were clear on auscultation. Her abdomen was soft  non-tender and non-distended. Neurological examination showed no focal deficits.  Investigations: Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation. Serum troponin level was slightly elevated.  Subsequent coronary angiography did not reveal any significant coronary artery disease. The left ventriculogram demonstrated apical ballooning with hypercontractile basal segments  consistent with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment and Progress: She was treated with supportive therapies including beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and aspirin. Gradually  the patient's symptoms reduced. The check-up after one month showed normal ECG  echocardiogram  and leveled troponin.  Discussion: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome  is a transient cardiac syndrome that features left ventricular apical ballooning (leads to changes in the heart muscle). This disorder is commonly precipitated by severe emotional stress. The syndrome is much more common in postmenopausal women.  Despite its severe initial presentation  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a reversible condition with favorable short- and long-term prognoses once the source of stress is removed  and adequate medical support is provided. This case also emphasizes the significant impact emotional stress can have on physical health.

She lives alone  though her two children reside in the same city. She has a history of chronic anxiety and depression  treated with Sertraline and psychotherapy. Apart from this  she reports occasional migraines and osteoarthritis in her hands and right hip. She has no reported history of cardiovascular disease but does suffer from hypertension which is well-controlled on Losartan.  Chief Complaint: She presented to the ER with acute chest pain  palpitations  and shortness of breath following the sudden death of her elder brother that occurred a few hours earlier. Her pain started abruptly  radiating to her back and left shoulder  and associated with nausea. She denied any association with exertion or meals.   Family History: Her father died at the age of 75 from myocardial infarction  while her mother  who is 93 years old  has a history of diabetes and hypertension. She has two younger siblings with no reported cardiovascular diseases.  Physical Examination: On examination  she was anxious  pale and diaphoretic with a blood pressure reading of 150/90 mmHg  pulse rate 110/min  irregular  and SaO2 (Oxygen saturation) 98% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a soft S1 heart sound and no murmurs. Respiratory  abdominal  and neurological exams were unremarkable.  Investigations: Her ECG showed ST segment elevation in the anterolateral leads that suggested an acute coronary syndrome. However  her cardiac troponin levels  while elevated  were not as high as typically seen with myocardial infarction. A Coronary angiogram was carried out to rule out coronary artery disease  which showed clean coronary arteries with no occlusions or narrowing. A subsequent echocardiogram identified left ventricular apical ballooning and reduced ejection fraction  compatible with the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Management: She was admitted to the cardiology ward where she was started on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors  with careful monitoring of her cardiac function. Due to the unusual nature of her condition  a consultation with a psychotherapist was also arranged to manage her anxiety and stress related to her brother's sudden death.  The patient showed a gradual but full recovery of left ventricular function within a month. She continues to be monitored regularly and also continues with her psychotherapy sessions. This case presents a classic picture of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""" triggered by acute emotional stress and serves to remind us of the role mental health can play in the emergence of physical disease."
15,9,59,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial59,"Patient Presentation:  A 67-year-old Caucasian female presented at the emergency department with sudden  severe chest pain. The pain had started during an argument with her neighbor. There were no indications of nausea  vomiting  sweating or dizziness. She had a history of hypertension which was medically managed without complications. However  there was no history of coronary artery disease  valvular heart disease or other cardiovascular diseases. Her BMI was within healthy range and she denied ever smoking or any recreational drug use. Her alcohol use was moderate. She lived alone but had an active social life.  The patient reported an increase in stressors including recent death of a close friend  financial issues and a worsening relationship with her children. She has a family history of cardiovascular disease as her father passed away from an acute myocardial infarction in his 60s. There was no history of arrhythmias  congestive heart failure or familial cardiomyopathy.  Physical Examination: Her blood pressure was 180/110 mm Hg and heart rate was 106 bpm. She had bilateral rales in her lungs  elevated jugular venous pressure and mild lower extremity edema suggesting heart failure.  Lab Results: Elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers indicated myocardial injury but her troponin I level was not strongly elevated. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads V2-V4 which typically indicates an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.   Additional Testing: Given this patient's presentation  immediate action was warranted to rule out acute coronary syndrome. Catheter angiography demonstrated normal coronary arteries. Left ventriculography revealed apical ballooning with preserved basal contraction—features consistent with a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Case Progression: Patient was started on beta blockers  ACE inhibitors and diuretics to manage the symptoms of heart failure and the hypertension. Counselling was also provided to manage stress and family dynamics.  Conclusion: The combination of severe stress  characteristic presentation  echocardiographic findings  and the lack of significant coronary artery disease led to the diagnosis of stress-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""". The patient’s hypertension could have been a possible predisposing factor. This case emphasizes the importance of considering TCM in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain  especially in postmenopausal women with a recent history of severe emotional stress.

Chief Complaint: Presenting to the Emergency Department complaining of severe chest pain  similar to that of a heart attack. She describes the pain as """"a constricting band around her chest"""" worsening on deep inspiration. The onset was sudden  and began earlier in the afternoon following the news of her son's car accident.  History of Present Illness: The patient  prior to admission  had been relatively healthy with only mild intermittent chest discomfort  attributed to an increase in stress levels due to the recent family events. She denies any significant change in her lifestyle  diet  or physical activity. She affirms she does not smoke tobacco  consume alcohol or take any illicit substances. There has not been any recent known exposure to illnesses.  Past Medical History: She has a known history of hypercholesterolemia  which is being managed by a low dose of Rosuvastatin. Other than that  she is otherwise healthy without a history of diabetes  hypertension or any hormonal disease.   Family History: Her parents have both passed away with non-cardiac related illnesses  and there are no known relatives with heart disease. Ms. L is the eldest of two siblings; her younger brother is healthy.  Physical Examination: On arrival  her vitals were normal except for a slightly elevated heart rate of 88 BPM and BP of 150/92 mmHg. She appears well-nourished  alert  and in acute pain. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable except for decreased chest movement on the left side.  Investigations: Her EKG demonstrated ST-elevation in the anterior leads (V2-V5). Initial cardiac troponin level was slightly elevated. Subsequent echocardiography revealed hyperkinesis of the basal segments of the left ventricle and apical ballooning. Coronary angiography was unremarkable  and did not show any significant coronary artery disease that could explain the echocardiographic findings.  Diagnosis: Based on clinical presentation and imaging findings  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (or stress cardiomyopathy) was made.   Plan: Ms. L was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) for close monitoring. Therapeutic management included short-term use of heart failure medications  such as ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics to manage her chest pain and the acute heart failure state. She is also recommended psychological support to handle the recent stressful situations in her life.   Doctor’s Notes: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is often triggered by extreme stress and can mimic symptoms of heart attack. It mostly affects postmenopausal women and is usually reversible. Considering Ms. L's recent loss and ongoing stressors  it’s crucial we engage a mental health professional in her care team to provide appropriate support and stress management techniques.  Given her age and presented stress level  effective treatment should alleviate her symptoms and prevent recurrence. The patient and any involved family should be educated about her condition  signs to watch for  and the importance of handling stress. Ms. L's medications will need to be reviewed and adjusted based on her response and followed-up regularly."

Heart sounds were regular without murmurs  rubs  or gallops.   ED Course: Initial cardiac markers were elevated  with Troponin I at 2.1 ng/mL (normal level is below 0.04 ng/mL). An ECG showed ST-elevation in leads V1-V3  indicating possible anterior myocardial infarction. She was sent to the cath lab for a possible emergent percutaneous coronary intervention.  Catheterization Findings: The arteriogram did not reveal severe obstructive coronary artery disease to explain her symptoms and ECG changes. It rather revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle  leading to a suspicion of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Further Investigations: An echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis showing a classic apical ballooning pattern with hyperkinesis of the basal segments and hypokinesis in the apical segments.   Overview: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  or stress cardiomyopathy  is a condition characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction  often triggered by extreme emotional or physical stress  as seen in Mrs. Xavier's case.  Conclusion: Based on the clinical presentation  EKG findings  elevated cardiac enzymes  and characteristic changes on echocardiogram  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy was made. Mrs. Xavier was started on medical therapy including beta blockers and ACE inhibitors.  Her close follow-up has been suggested to monitor her recovery and adjust her medications accordingly. Counselling for stress management was also advised.
15,9,62,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial62,"Patient Presentation:  Name: Mrs. Jane Falcon Age: 68  Sex: Female  Race: Caucasian   Present Complaint: Mrs. Falcon presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  resembling a heart attack  that started suddenly after hearing about her son's car accident. She had a sense of impending doom  was pale  and sweating.  Assessment: On examination  she was overweight with a BMI of 30. She has hypertension controlled on Atenolol 50mg daily for the last 5 years. A physical examination showed tachycardia  no murmur or other abnormal heart sounds. Lungs were clear on auscultation  and there was no peripheral edema noted. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed minimal ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads V2-V4.  Past Medical History: Patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension  and a remote history of mild depression following the death of her husband  for which she received counselling but no medication was necessary. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol socially.   Family History: Family history includes ischemic heart disease in her father  who passed away at the age of 72 after a massive myocardial infarction. Mrs. Falcon's mother  aged 85  is in primary care with dementia. Her only sibling  an elder sister  is alive and well with no significant medical history.   Investigations and Diagnosis: Blood tests showed a slightly elevated troponin level (0.05 ng/mL). Echocardiogram demonstrated hyperdynamic basal segments  hypokinesia of the apical segments  and no valvular abnormalities. A coronary angiography was performed which showed no significant coronary artery disease. A heart MRI was also completed which confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Plan: Medical management was initiated comprising of an ACE inhibitor (Lisinopril) and beta-blocker (Metoprolol) for heart failure  along with the patient’s regular antihypertensive (Atenolol). It was decided to withhold aspirin and statin since her angiogram was normal. She was also referred to a health psychologist for the management of her stress levels.   Discussion: TCM is notorious for mimicking an acute myocardial infarction and is commonly precipitated by intense psychological or emotional stress  as seen with Mrs. Falcon. Referred to as """"broken heart syndrome """" TCM is most frequently diagnosed in postmenopausal women and may be related to reduced estrogen levels that cause changes in the response of the myocardium to catecholamines. Fortunately  with appropriate medical treatment  the prognosis for TCM is generally good  and Mrs. Falcon is expected to have a full recovery. A long-term follow-up plan including regular cardiology reviews and stress management is necessary.  - End Report -"
15,9,63,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial63,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. A  a 62-year-old Asian female  presented with sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath and profuse sweating. She was rushed to the emergency department (ED). On arrival  her blood pressure measured 140/95 mmHg and heart rate was recorded at 110 beats per minute.  Past History:  Mrs. A is a retired school teacher and currently lives with her husband. She is a non-smoker and a teetotaler with no history of illicit drugs usage. She was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago and is on oral hypoglycemic agents for the same. Mrs. A also has a history of hypertension for the last ten years  for which she’s been on antihypertensive medication.   Family History:  Her father passed away following a myocardial infarction at the age of 72. Her mother has a history of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. One older sibling had bypass surgery due to coronary artery disease. Her two younger brothers are healthy with no significant medical history.  Investigation and Diagnosis:  The electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed signs suggestive of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)  but initial cardiac markers were not remarkably high. An urgent coronary angiogram was ordered  which showed normal coronaries. An echocardiogram showed apical ballooning with good basal function suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Further inquiry revealed that Mrs. A had been under tremendous emotional stress due to her daughter's recent divorce.  Management:  Mrs. A was admitted to the cardiac care unit for monitoring and treatment. She was managed with standard therapy for heart failure including ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. Given that excessive catecholamine release due to stress is believed to play a role in takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a psychiatric referral was also made to manage her emotional stress.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates how  despite presenting with symptoms suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome  Mrs. A's significant emotional stress and her resulting presentation led to her diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy - a condition also known as 'broken-heart syndrome.' With appropriate treatment and stress management  she is expected to make a good recovery  as the condition is often temporary. However  close follow-ups would be crucial  considering her family history of cardiovascular diseases and her own history of diabetes and hypertension.
15,9,64,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial64,Case Presentation:   Patient Profile: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female  named Mrs. Smith. She is a retired schoolteacher and lives alone. She has a history of hypertension and mild hyperlipidemia for which she is on medication (Lisinopril and Simvastatin respectively). She lost her husband two years ago and has two daughters who live out of state. She has a history of anxiety and depression  for which she had been taking Fluoxetine back when her husband was still alive. There is no significant family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Presentation: Mrs. Smith presented at the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain radiating down her left arm. The symptoms began abruptly while she was watching a news report about a tragic accident which resulted in multiple fatalities. She reported her symptoms as similar to “a weight on her chest ” which had worsened over the course of an hour. She further reported associated nausea and lightheadedness  but no shortness of breath.   Evaluation: Her vital signs on arrival showed a blood pressure of 155/92 mm Hg  a heart rate of 105 bpm  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  temp at 98.7 F  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome.  Medical Management: The patient was initially managed for NSTEMI with aspirin  clopidogrel  and heparin along with sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain relief. Urgent 2D-echocardiography showed apical ballooning with a reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 42%  with sparing of the basal regions. Given the inconsistency between the angiography results and the wall-motion abnormalities seen on echo  the findings suggested takotsubo cardiomyopathy also known as broken heart syndrome.  Following the diagnosis  the patient’s ACS protocol was pulled down  and medications were readjusted. She was successfully managed conservatively with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and anti-anxiety medication (low-dose benzodiazepines). The patient was stabilized over the course of the next few days. A repeat echo on day five showed significant recovery of LV function.  Conclusion: Being a stress-induced cardiomyopathy  a timely diagnosis of takotsubo is crucial as the management differs significantly from ACS. In this case  the history of recent intense emotional stress due to tragic news  the unusual gradient of the wall motion abnormality  and the absence of significant coronary artery obstructive disease on angiography led to the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive history taking and analysis of clinical findings.
15,9,65,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial65,"Patient Presentation:  Ms. A is a 68-year-old Caucasian female presenting to the emergency department with complaints of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm and jaw  along with shortness of breath. She describes the pain as ‘crushing’ in nature and reports feeling extreme weakness. Associated symptoms include nausea and palpitations.   Past medical history reveals that she was previously diagnosed with hypertension for which she has been on medication (Lisinopril) and type 2 diabetes mellitus  controlled with diet and Metformin. She also has had a hysterectomy due to fibroids at age 45 and a cholecystectomy at age 60. She has no previous history of any heart disease or other significant medical conditions.  Social history: She is a widow who lives alone. She quit smoking 10 years ago after a 30-year history and is a social drinker. She reports that she recently experienced a major stressful event  the death of her only son in a motor vehicle accident a week ago.  Family history: Her parents died of old age  peaceful and naturally. She has one sibling  a sister diagnosed with breast cancer. There is no known family history of heart disease.  On examination  vital signs revealed blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  heart rate of 120 bpm  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The rest of the physical examination was largely unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Her cardiac biomarkers were elevated  with her troponin level more than twice the upper limit.  Given her clinical presentation and findings  the patient was started on aspirin  nitroglycerin  and oxygen therapy for suspected myocardial infarction (MI) and was immediately sent for cardiac catheterization. However  coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease to explain her symptoms. Left ventriculography demonstrated """"tako-tsubo-like"""" left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning and hyperkinesis of the basal walls - classic for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Discussions:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or “broken heart syndrome ” is a condition typically triggered by severe emotional or physical stress  leading to transient left ventricular apical ballooning and mimics myocardial infarction. The death of her son was most likely the trigger for Ms. A.  Ms. A was started on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for heart failure. She was counseled about the condition and reassured  given its usually favorable prognosis. She will be followed up closely in an outpatient cardiology clinic for monitoring and adjustment of her medications. "

She is a teetotaler  non-smoker  and holds a job as a high school teacher. She has a history of generalized anxiety disorder that has been well-controlled on medication (Escitalopram) for the past 15 years.  Presenting Complaint: The patient was brought to the emergency department with sudden-onset  severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  mimicking a heart attack. The pain started while she was conducting a parent-teacher meeting  which she described as highly stressful.  Medical History: The patient had no history of any other chronic diseases such as hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or kidney disease. The only significant aspect of her medical history was generalized anxiety disorder.  Clinical Assessment: Her vital signs on arrival were: blood pressure 150/95 mmHg  pulse 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-elevation in precordial leads. Her troponin levels were elevated  suggesting possible myocardial injury.   Investigations and Diagnosis: Owing to the clinical presentation and the ECG findings  an initial diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was suspected. However  upon performing a coronary angiogram  no significant blockages were seen. A subsequent echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle but preserved function at the base - classic features of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Treatment and Management: She was admitted to the cardiology unit where she was treated with standard heart failure medications including ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and diuretics. The patient was stabilized and her chest pains and dyspnea improved significantly over the course of her stay. Her psychiatrist was consulted to optimize her anxiety management.   Follow-up and Prognosis: Considering the transient nature of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  her overall prognosis was good. She was discharged after 5 days with a follow-up appointment in cardiology and psychiatry clinics. She was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and consider therapy or counseling to manage stress.  Summary: This case emphasizes the role of intense emotional or physical stress leading to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome."""" It also underscores the importance of a holistic approach  addressing not only the physical symptoms but also the mental health aspects in the management of such patients."

Ms. A is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol use (2-3 units per week) and had a high BMI (30 kg/m2).   Chief Complaint:  The patient presented to the Emergency Department experiencing acute chest pain and shortness of breath following a stressful event at work.  Past Medical History:  Ms. A has a history of hypertension for which she has been on Lisinopril 10mg daily; she has been well-controlled on medication. She has no history of diabetes or high cholesterol. She also reported a long-standing history of anxiety without currently receiving any treatment.  Family history:   Ms. A is the youngest of three siblings. Her father passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 68  and her mother has a history of type II diabetes mellitus. Both of her brothers have been diagnosed with hypertension.  Physical Examination:  On examination  she appeared anxious  vital signs were BP - 150/90 mmHg  HR - 110 bpm  RR - 22 bpm  SpO2-94% on room air. Cardiac exam revealed tachycardia without any murmurs  rales were auscultated at the lung bases.  Investigations:  Electrocardiogram indicated ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Troponin levels were elevated. Subsequently  coronary angiography was performed  which revealed normal coronary arteries  ruling out acute coronary syndrome. A transthoracic echocardiogram was conducted  showing left ventricular apical ballooning accompanied by hyperkinesis of the basal segments  reinforcing the tentative diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment:  Ms. A was admitted to the cardiology ward for monitoring and management. She was started on beta-blockers - Metoprolol 25mg twice  a daily regimen of ACE inhibitors  and aspirin. She also received pain control and anxiety management.  Conclusion:  In the context of acute emotional stress  a clinical presentation of chest pain  ECG changes  and echocardiogram findings  Ms. A was diagnosed with stress-induced takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Her condition improved steadily over the course of a week.   During outpatient follow-up six weeks later  repeat transthoracic echocardiogram showed complete resolution of her left ventricular dysfunction. She was also referred to a clinical psychologist to manage her anxiety due to the strong association between psychological stress and takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Her case highlights the significance of stress-related disorders in the onset of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
15,9,68,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial68,Patient Profile: Ms. Thompson  a 65-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain mimicking a heart attack. She denied any history of cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities. The patient works as an elementary school teacher and lives alone  recently experiencing the sudden loss of her spouse that led to severe emotional distress.  Medical History: Ms. Thompson was generally healthy with a medical history only significant for mild hypertension controlled with medication (lisinopril). She is non-diabetic  non-alcoholic  and non-smoker. She has no known allergies.  Family History: There is a family history of Alzheimer's disease  but no noted prevalence of heart disease or other significant illnesses in her immediate family.  On Examination: She appeared anxious and distressed. Her blood pressure was 159/95 mmHg and heart rate was 110 bpm. Cardiovascular examination revealed no heart murmurs  and the rest of the examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Tests: An ECG performed upon arrival showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads  suggestive of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. But emergent coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis. Lab results showed slightly elevated cardiac biomarkers (troponin level).   Echocardiography demonstrated apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal walls  consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as ‘broken heart syndrome’.   Treatment and Progress: She was admitted to the cardiology ward for monitoring and management. The patient was treated with supportive therapy  which included ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and anti-anxiety medication. She showed dramatic symptom improvement over the following week  and repeated echocardiography showed a return of normal function of the left ventricle.  Recommendations: Ms. Thompson was advised to engage in stress management techniques and psychotherapy  given the emotional stressors identified as potential triggers for her condition.   The given case presentation highlights the close relationship between emotional stress and takotsubo cardiomyopathy  an increasingly recognized cause of acute heart failure  lethal ventricular arrhythmias  and ventricular rupture. While this condition is typically reversible  it can occasionally lead to severe complications  such as heart failure. Hence  it's crucial that healthcare providers consider this diagnosis when assessing patients with acute coronary syndrome  especially in postmenopausal women with recent significant emotional stress. 
15,9,69,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial69,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Jane Doe Age: 62  Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher  Chief Complaint:  Extreme chest pain  mimicking symptoms of a heart attack  Present History:  Mrs. Doe presented with acute chest pain following the sudden death of her husband. The pain began whilst she was attending his funeral with descriptions of the pain as sharp and constant. Accompanying the chest pain she experienced difficulty in breathing  lightheadedness  and cold sweats.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus five years back but controls it with diet and oral hypoglycemic agents. She is non-smoker and has no known drug allergies.   Family History:  The family history includes a brother who suffered from a myocardial infarction at 65 years of age and her late husband who suffered from coronary artery disease.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Mrs. Doe was rushed to ER where immediate diagnostics tests were performed - ECG showed ST elevations and cardiac enzymes were elevated  initially pointing towards acute myocardial infarction (MI). However  coronary angiography showed no significant blockages. Echocardiography revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction. The symptoms  along with the negative angiogram and positive echocardiogram led to a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome).  Treatment:  Over the next few days  she was closely monitored in the hospital. As her vital signs normalized  she was gradually decongested using diuretics and then started on angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers.  Current Status:  She was discharged after 7 days of hospitalization once her symptoms were stable with a follow-up appointment scheduled with cardiology. Patient reported adherence to medication and overall improved health during two-week follow-up. Her prognosis is good  however she was advised stress management to avoid recurrence.  Conclusion:  Interestingly  this case underscores the significant correlation between stress and acute heart conditions. It shows that while it's vital to initially consider common conditions such as myocardial infarction  it's equally important to diagnose rarer conditions like takotsubo cardiomyopathy that exhibit similar symptoms to more familiar illnesses.
15,9,70,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial70,Patient Presentation:  Jane Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. Pain started about 24 hours prior and was consistent  located in the substernal region radiating to the left shoulder. The patient describes it as a severe  squeezing chest pain. She also experienced associated symptoms of nausea and excessive sweating. There were no obvious precipitating factors.  Jane is a retired school teacher  living alone following her husband's death 10 years ago. She has a history of hypertension  which is managed with Losartan 50mg daily. She reports an allergy to Penicillin causing rash. She is a non-smoker and rarely drinks alcohol  and with no history of illicit drug use.   Family history reveals her father died of a heart attack at 70. Her mother died at 79 due to Alzheimer's disease. She has one brother living with type II diabetes. There is no family history of cardiomyopathy.  On examination  her vital signs were as follows: BP 130/80 mmHg  pulse rate 110/min  respiratory rate 24/min  oxygen saturation 96% on room air  and temperature 36.7°C. Cardiac examination revealed tachycardia. No murmurs or gallop were noted.  Laboratory data showed slightly elevated troponin levels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ST elevation in the anterior-septal leads. She was initially treated as an Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). However  a subsequent echocardiogram revealed hypo kinesis of the mid and apical segments of the left ventricle with preserved basal function  confirming the suspicion of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy or “broken heart syndrome”).  Jane reported experiencing a lot of stress lately due to the sudden death of a good friend. This indeed can be a trigger for the onset of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  as the condition is often preceded by severe emotional stress.  Jane was treated with conservative heart failure management  which included ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers  and her symptoms gradually improved over the following days. She was also referred to a psychologist to assist in managing her stress and grief.  In conclusion  Jane's non-specific symptoms and ECG changes initially pointed towards ACS. However  her echocardiogram findings and recent emotional stress led to the final diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Therefore  it highlights the importance of considering this diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with symptoms mimicking ACS  particularly in the context of recent significant emotional stress.  Patient teaches us the importance of thorough history-taking and considering less common causes in our differential diagnosis to prevent misdiagnosis. Additionally  it demonstrates the interconnection between physical and mental health and the necessity of holistic patient care.
15,9,71,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial71,Patient Presentation:  Ms. J. Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian female who recently presented to the emergency room with severe  sudden onset chest pain. The pain was described as sharp and radiating down her left arm. She also reported experiencing shortness of breath  feelings of extreme anxiety  and a sudden loss of consciousness just before admission.  Past Medical History:   Ms. Smith has a 10-year history of hypertension  treated with hydrochlorothiazide  and controlled type II diabetes mellitus  treated with metformin. She has no known allergies and her immunizations are up to date. There is no history of smoking or alcohol abuse. Two years ago  she was involved in a car accident and suffered a minor concussion. There is no history suggestive of coronary artery disease  arrhythmia  or previous heart attack.    Family History:  Her father died of a heart attack at the age of 70 and her mother has a history of controlled hypertension. She has a younger sister who was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago.   Physical Examination:  On examination  she was anxious. Her blood pressure was 170/95 mm Hg  pulse was 110/min  respiration rate was 24/min  and she was afebrile. Heart sounds were regular with no murmurs. Lungs were clear and her abdomen was soft and non-tender.   Investigation:  The Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a repolarization abnormality suggestive of cardiac ischemia. However  the blood tests did not show the levels of cardiac enzymes or troponin T typically associated with a myocardial infarction. An emergency coronary angiography did not reveal any occlusive coronary artery disease  and left ventriculography demonstrated the unique finding of a ballooning of the left ventricle during systole - a sign consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Diagnosis:  Taking into account the patient's symptoms  ECG findings  and left ventriculography data  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made.   Treatment:  She was admitted to the critical care unit for careful monitoring. Treatment was carried out with aspirin  a beta-blocker (metoprolol)  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and diuretics to reduce the patient's discomfort and anxiety  the workload on her heart  and to manage her hypertension.  Conclusion:  Ms. Smith’s case highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis for patients who present with symptoms similar to acute coronary syndrome  especially in postmenopausal women and in the absence of significant coronary artery disease. Early diagnosis and management of takotsubo cardiomyopathy can lead to complete recovery.
15,9,72,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial72,"Patient Information:   Mrs. Linda Matthews  a 70-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department complaining of acute shortness of breath. Her weight is 160 lbs  and she stands 5’6"""" tall. She lives in New Jersey with her husband. She leads an active lifestyle  regularly walks for exercise  has never smoked  and consumes alcohol socially. She has two adult daughters who are both healthy.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Matthews has a history of mild hypersensitive and hypercholesterolemia. Her conditions have been well controlled with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide and statins with regular follow-ups with her primary care physician. She has previously maintained her health well with no hospitalizations or surgeries. She has never been diagnosed with heart disease nor experienced acute distress symptoms as she is experiencing now.  Social and Family History:   She has a family history of cardiovascular disease. Her father had a heart attack in his late 60s  and her younger sibling was diagnosed with hypertension in her 50s. She leads a moderately stressful life  taking care of her elderly husband who recently suffered a stroke.   Hospitalization and current complaints:  Over the previous three days  Mrs. Matthews experienced acute  severe chest pain radiating to the jawline  and nausea. She reported these symptoms started after she received the news of the death of a close friend.   On examination  her blood pressure was 158/90 mmHg  pulse 105 beats per minute  and respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. Her EKG revealed ST-elevation in the anterolateral leads  initially suspected to be due to myocardial infarction.   Further Diagnostics and Findings:  The emergency department initiated treatment for an acute coronary syndrome. However  cardiac biomarkers showed a limited increase in troponin. A coronary angiogram was performed  which revealed no significant obstructions in the coronary arteries.   Contrarily  a left ventriculogram demonstrated apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesis  compatible with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM). Echocardiography also confirmed these findings  showing reduced ejection fraction and dyskinesis in the left ventricular mid segments with apical involvement.  Diagnosis and Treatment:  Based on her medical history  social factors  symptoms  and test results  Mrs. Matthews was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome.  She was administered a low-dose beta-blocker  ACE inhibitor  and aspirin. She was also recommended to undergo stress management therapies  including counseling and exercises like yoga and meditation.  Discussion:  This case demonstrates the correlation between emotional trauma and the development of TCM. TCM often mimics symptoms of a heart attack and tends to occur more commonly in postmenopausal women. Diagnosis can be challenging and commonly relies on coronary angiograms to rule out myocardial infarction. Prognosis for patients with TCM following proper treatment and stress management is generally good. Future research should focus on additional therapeutic strategies to prevent recurrence and on-going efforts to educate patients and clinicians regarding the role of emotional stress on heart health."
15,9,73,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial73,Patient Profile:  Ms. Jane Doe is a 67-year-old Caucasian woman who is recently retired. She lives alone and recently lost her spouse due to lung cancer  which caused her significant distress. She is a non-smoker and non-drinker  with no known drug allergies. Her medical history includes controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her family history is remarkable for heart disease  with both her parents having died from myocardial infarctions at ages 60 and 65.  Current Condition:  After the death of her spouse  she presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain  dyspnea  and anxiety  reminiscent of acute myocardial infarction. Her initial blood pressure was 178/98 mmHg. Her pulse was 110 beats/minute  and her respiratory rate was 24 breaths/minute. She appeared pale but had no cyanosis  no jugular venous distention  and her lung sounds were clear.  Investigation:  ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior precordial leads. Troponin I levels were significantly elevated. A coronary angiogram  however  showed no significant coronary artery disease which could account for her symptoms and the ECG changes. An echocardiogram was performed  revealing hypokinesis of the mid-segment and the apical segment of the left ventricle  with hyperkinesis of the basal segments – a pattern not typical of myocardial infarction but indicative of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome).  Diagnosis:  Based on her symptoms  the absence of significant occlusive coronary disease  the ECG changes and the echocardiographic findings  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy was made. The emotional distress caused by her husband's demise is thought to have preceded this condition.  Treatment/Management Plan:  Ms. Doe was treated with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and nursing intervention aimed at alleviating her distress. Her chest pain and dyspnea improved considerably  and she was discharged from the hospital after 5 days. Psychological support was arranged for her dealing with the severe emotional stress.  Follow-up:  A 6-week follow-up appointment was scheduled. She will undergo repeat echocardiography in 3 months to confirm resolution of the cardiomyopathy. In the long term  she has been advised to continue her antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy and to participate in regular counseling sessions to cope with her loss and prevent any recurrence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
15,9,74,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial74,Patient Presentation:  Ms. A is a 65-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. She is a retired school teacher  living autonomously  and has no known drug or food allergies. She denies substance use  has a 15-pack year smoking history but quit a decade ago. She recently lost her spouse  leaving her under immense emotional stress. She has a family history of heart diseases  including her mother who died from myocardial infarction at the age of 70.  Primary Complaint:  Ms. A presented to the emergency department reporting a sudden onset of severe chest pain while grieving her husband  which she described as a 'heavy' sensation radiating towards her left arm and jaw. The pain began four hours prior to her arrival at the hospital.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  Ms. A appeared anxious and distressed. Vital signs showed tachycardia (112 beats/min) and mild hypertension (BP 150/90 mmHg). Her ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. Blood tests showed a slight elevation in cardiac enzymes (troponin levels). She has a BMI of 28.4 kg/m² and her most recent HbA1c was noted to be 8.2%  indicating uncontrolled diabetes.  Management:  Given the patient’s symptoms  an angiogram was conducted which revealed no significant obstructive coronary disease  thus ruling out a conventional heart attack. An echocardiogram was also performed  which showed a typical apical ballooning and basal hypercontractility of the left ventricle  resulting in a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome).   Ms. A was admitted to the coronary care unit where she was treated with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and diuretics. Her diabetic status was managed by an endocrinologist. She was also referred to a clinical psychologist for counseling to address her emotional distress and grief.  Potential Complications and Precautions:  Given her age  stress  hypertension  diabetes  and family history  Ms. A is at risk for potential complications such as arrhythmia  heart failure  and recurrence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Therefore  ongoing monitoring  strict control of blood pressure and glucose levels  along with stress management techniques like relaxation exercises  are of utmost importance in her prognosis.  Conclusion:  Ms. A's case emphasizes takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with symptoms and signs mimicking acute coronary syndrome. Ms. A's recent emotional stress serves as a reminder of the powerful influence of psychological factors on cardiac health.
15,9,75,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial75,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mrs. Jones  is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who presents with sudden  severe chest pain and shortness of breath that has lasted for several hours. The pain radiates from the chest to the left arm and shoulder. The patient also reported a feeling of lightheadedness and fainting.  Past Medical History:  She has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are well managed with antihypertensive drugs and statins respectively. Her other medical history includes hypothyroidism and a distant history of severe gallstones leading to cholecystectomy. The patient is not diabetic. She is a former smoker having quit twenty years ago and denies any history of alcohol or illicit substance use.   Demographics:  Mrs. Jones is a retired schoolteacher and lives alone. She lives in a suburban area and is moderately active; she enjoys gardening and walking in her free time.  Family History:  The patient's father had a history of ischemic heart disease  suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 72  and had subsequent coronary artery bypass surgery. Her mother died at the age of 60 due to severe pneumonia  and had a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mrs. Jones has a single older sibling with no known cardiac conditions. She has two children  both living and well  with no cardiac conditions.  Presenting Event:  Before the onset of her symptoms  Mrs. Jones reports that she was experiencing significant emotional distress over the sudden death of her beloved pet dog. After series of investigations  Mrs. Jones has been diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as 'broken heart syndrome').  Laboratory testing at the time of presentation showed elevated cardiac enzymes  suggesting potential myocardial injury. An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion. An echocardiogram revealed significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical ballooning  a typical finding of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  but no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease was found on coronary angiography.  Management and Plan:  Given Mrs. Jones' recent emotional distress and the acute onset of her symptoms  stress-induced cardiomyopathy was strongly suspected. She is being managed with supportive care  including aspirin  beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers. She will also be referred to a counselor  as addressing her emotional distress is paramount to her recovery. Mrs. Jones will continue to be monitored regularly by her primary care physician and a cardiologist to watch for potential recurrences or complications.
15,9,76,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial76,Title: A Case Study of Psychogenic Stress-Induced Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Profile:  Sex: Female  Age: 67  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Medical History:   The patient is a retired school teacher with a past medical history of essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril  and osteoporosis managed with bisphosphonates. She is a non-smoker but has a 15-year history of moderate alcohol intake.   Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath experienced after receiving news of her son's death. On admission  her blood pressure was elevated at 160/90 mmHg  and a heart rate of 110 beats per minute was noted. EKG revealed findings consistent with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).   Hospital Course:  Examinations showed a significantly increased level of cardiac-specific troponins and normal coronary angiography report  ruling out the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction. The left ventriculogram showed the characteristic apical ballooning of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Anterior and apical hypokinesia with a hypercontractile base was evident on the echocardiogram.   Family History:   Family history spotlighted a maternal history of ischemic heart disease. However  none of the patient's siblings had a history of cardiac illness. No family history of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis and Management:  Managed as a case of acute myocardial infarction initially  the findings of an angiogram and echocardiogram (apical ballooning) hinted towards the diagnosis of stress-induced cardiomyopathy  also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). Treatment consisting of aspirin  ACE inhibitors  and beta-blockers was initiated  and lifestyle modifications were advised to the patient  focusing on the management of psychological stress.  Discussion:  This case highlights the need for healthcare professionals to be aware of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain and elevated cardiac markers  especially in post-menopausal women who have experienced significant emotional stress. The management of such cases primarily involves symptomatic treatment and stress management.  Follow-Up:  Patient follow-up after a month showed significant improvement with normalization of left ventricular function  and troponins levels returned to within normal ranges. She is scheduled for routine examinations for continual monitoring of the condition in the future.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the important role of emotional stress as a precipitating factor in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Awareness among clinicians can ensure a prompt and accurate diagnosis  preventing unnecessary invasive procedures and implementing appropriate therapeutic measures promptly. It also underlines the significance of psychological support in managing such cases.
15,9,77,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial77,Patient Case Presentation:  Patient Demographics: Ms. A  a 68-year-old Asian woman from San Francisco  presents to the emergency department accompanied by her two daughters. She's a retired school teacher and lives with her elder daughter. She's a nonsmoker and does not have a history of substance or alcohol abuse. She has a history of hypertension well controlled with medications  and without any reported cardiac disease. There is no history of Diabetes Mellitus or any other endocrine disorder. Her family history is significant for hypertension in her mother and sister.  Presenting Complaint: Ms. A presents with shortness of breath and a severe  acute onset chest pain which started earlier in the afternoon while she was attending a heated argument with her neighbor  described as a persistent heavy ache centrally located in her chest  radiating to her left shoulder and arm  but no associated sweating or nausea.  Examination and Investigation: On examination  her blood pressure was 160/90mmHg  pulse 110bpm  and respiration rate 25breaths/minute. An ECG was performed which showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads (V2 through V5). Her Troponin T levels were elevated indicative of myocardial injury. Coronary angiography was done which revealed minimal atherosclerotic plaque. However  left ventriculography demonstrated apical ballooning with hypokinesis that was suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  not typical of any coronary artery disease.  Management: Ms. A was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit. Given her elevated blood pressure and rapid pulse  she was treated with a beta-blocker to lower her heart rate and blood pressure. She also received anticoagulation therapy to prevent blood clot formation within the dysfunctional ventricle. After 5 days  repeat echocardiography showed almost complete resolution of her symptoms and the ventricle regained its normal function.  Discussion: Also known as Broken Heart Syndrome  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is typically triggered by severe emotional stress. The exact cause of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is unknown. However  it is thought that a surge of stress hormones  such as adrenaline  might temporarily damage the hearts of some people. The symptoms mimic those of a heart attack hence properly distinguishing between the two can be challenging. However  unlike a heart attack  there's no evidence of blocked heart arteries in takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  In Ms. A's case  the suspected trigger for her condition was the severe emotional stress from the argument with her neighbor. Her rapid response to treatment and almost complete return to normal function are typical of this syndrome and distinguishes it from myocardial infarctions. It also highlights the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of patients with suspected heart attacks especially if the triggering factors involve emotional or physical stressors.
15,9,78,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial78,"Patient Profile Presentation:  Patient Information: Mrs. Cynthia Jameson  a 64-year-old Caucasian female  domicile of Albany  New-York  is a retired school teacher who lives a quiet life.  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Jameson was brought into the ER presenting with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The symptoms had quickly escalated over 3 hours  becoming distressing.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Jameson had a history of hypertension and stage II chronic kidney disease for which she conducted regular check-ups and took prescribed medication. She also suffers from moderate recurring anxiety and depression for which she is under psychiatric treatment. Besides that  her medical history is noncontributory and has never been hospitalized before.  Family History: Her father died of a heart attack at 66-years-old  and her sister had a twin pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia. The rest of the family has a significant history of longevity unaffected by heart diseases or other severe health conditions.  Clinical Examination: Upon examination  Mrs. Jameson demonstrated symptoms typically associated with a myocardial infarction (heart attack) including elevated heart rate and high blood pressure. She also had signs of mild fluid overload. Her cardiovascular physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.  Investigations: The immediate Echocardiogram exhibited significant systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Her coronary angiogram showed no significant obstructive coronary disease but did illustrate a peculiar pattern of hypokinesis and ballooning of the apical segments of the left ventricle  strongly suggesting a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Blood tests showed mildly elevated troponin levels and other blood parameters were within normal limits.  Diagnosis and Management:  Based on the patient’s history  symptoms  and findings of coronary angiogram  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""" was made. This condition often occurs after severe emotional stress  although no significant stressor was identified.  Mrs. Jameson was managed conservatively with a beta-blocker  an ACE inhibitor  aspirin  statins  and temporary diuretic  in addition to psychological support. Her chest pain and breathlessness began to improve over subsequent days.   Lessons Learnt: This case study reinforces the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women presenting with acute chest pain. It also emphasizes the critical role of mental health care in managing such patients and overall cardiovascular wellbeing. Given the patient's robust family history of cardiovascular disease and her psychiatric history  she was at a considerable risk for TCM which remained overlooked until now."
15,9,79,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial79,Case Presentation  Patient Information:  Our patient is a 62-year-old African American woman named Ms. Smith  presented to the emergency department with severe constrictive chest pain that radiated to both arms  accompanied by shortness of breath. She is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. Ms. Smith currently lives alone  recently widowed after her husband passed away two months ago. Her body mass index is 26.2  and she doesn't follow a particular diet  nor does she exercise regularly.  Past Medical History: Ms. Smith has a history of hypertension for the past 10 years  controlled with low-dose Lisinopril. Her other medical conditions include controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past six years and treated hypothyroidism. She has no other hospitalizations or surgeries previously and has no known allergy towards any medicines or food. The patient has not received any psychiatric treatment  but she has been dealing with a significant amount of stress due to her recent loss.  Family History: Her mother has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  and her father died at 76 due to coronary artery disease. She has two siblings  both of whom have hypertension. None of her immediate family members have a documented history of cardiomyopathy.   Presenting Concerns and Findings: Her symptoms started suddenly and peaked within minutes  and there was no noted trigger. She denied symptoms of nausea  vomiting  palpitations or syncope. No significant abnormalities were detected during a physical exam. Initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation in precordial leads. Troponin T levels were high  suggesting a myocardial infarct. An emergent coronary angiography instead showed patent coronary arteries without any signs of plaque rupture or thrombosis  which ruled out an acute myocardial infarction. Echocardiography revealed apical ballooning  with hypokinesis of the apex and hyperkinesis of the base of the heart  leading us to a suspected diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Plan and Prognosis: She was put on standard heart failure therapy  including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors  and treated symptomatically with analgesics and oxygen supplementation. A psychiatric consult was requested to assess her psychological welfare. The prognosis of the disease is generally favorable  but it depends mainly on how the patient manages her stress and the responsiveness to treatment.  This case illustrates that though Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is often precipitated by extreme stress  it can also be triggered by bereavement  as happened in our patient. The case underlines the importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in differential diagnosis in post-menopausal women presenting with acute coronary syndrome  especially when the potential for extreme stress exists.
15,9,80,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial80,Patient Presentation: The patient is a 63-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian female recently diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome. The patient was a retired office administrator leading an independent life until the recent episode.   Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The episode occurred after receiving news of her estranged husband’s demise.  Medical History: She has a known medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and major depressive disorder. She has experienced two previous episodes of anxiety-induced panic attacks. The patient had a hysterectomy at the age of 48 due to fibroids and has been on hormone replacement therapy since then. No history of cardiovascular diseases or unmanaged cholesterol levels. She is a nonsmoker and does not consume alcohol.  Pharmaceutical history: The patient is currently on atenolol for hypertension  metformin for diabetes  and fluoxetine for her depression. She consistently adheres to her medication regimen as prescribed.   Family History: She has a family history of cardiovascular diseases - her father died from an acute myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and her elder brother was recently diagnosed with coronary artery disease.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  the patient was anxious  and her blood pressure was measured elevated at 165/100 mmHg. Other vitals included a heart rate of 110 BPM  respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute  and body mass index pointing towards obesity. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed nonspecific ST-segment changes  but no signs of an acute myocardial infarction.  Hospital Course: In the ED and the subsequent hospital course  the patient underwent cardiac biomarker testing  which showed a modest elevation in Troponin I levels. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a reduced ejection fraction of 35% with hypokinesis of apical segments  typical of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis: The diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made based on the patient's presenting symptoms  the absence of coronary artery occlusion  the transient nature of the left ventricular dysfunction  and findings on the ECG and TTE.  Plan: The patient was managed conservatively with supportive care including beta blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and anticoagulation therapy. Consideration of psychotherapy or psychiatric consultation given the likely stress-related etiology of her condition. A follow-up echocardiogram in the coming weeks will be necessary to assess the recovery of her heart function.
15,9,81,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial81,Patient Presentation:   Ms. G  a 72-year-old Caucasian female  presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain which started about an hour ago. The pain is described as a heavy feeling in her chest that radiates down her left arm. The patient has also reported a feeling of shortness of breath.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled with medication (Lisinopril and Simvastatin  respectively). She’s never been diagnosed with coronary artery disease  nor has she ever had any percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The patient quit smoking ten years ago and doesn't consume alcohol. She follows a balanced diet and engages in light exercise  such as walking.  Family History:  The patient has one sibling who has a history of coronary artery disease. There is no family history of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The patient's parents died at an old age and had no history of any major heart disease.  Presenting Complaint and Investigation:  A 12-lead ECG was performed upon her arrival  and it displayed ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion  suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction. On further investigation  her Troponin I level was also found to be moderately elevated. She was rushed to the cath lab for primary percutaneous coronary intervention thinking it could be a case of acute coronary syndrome. However  the coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease.  The left ventriculography and the echocardiogram showed a typical apical ballooning pattern with basal hyperkinesis  consistent with the patient's symptoms and a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   Discussion:  This diagnosis was unexpected as Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is usually precipitated by emotional or physical stress. However  Ms. G neither underwent any stressful event recently nor does she have any significant psychiatric history. This case underlines the fact that Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy can occur without any identifiable stressor.   The patient was treated with symptom-directed therapy which included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers  and anticoagulants. The patient's symptoms improved gradually  and a follow-up echocardiogram showed resolution of the previous wall motion abnormalities  confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.   Patient Education:  Ms. G was counseled on the nature of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  the importance of compliance with medications  and regular follow-ups to assess her recovery and the potential for recurrence. Stress management strategies were also discussed.   And he was referred for cardiac rehabilitation to prevent deconditioning while she recovers.
15,9,82,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial82,Patient Profile: Mrs. S is a 68-year-old Caucasian female residing in Little Riverside Town. She is married with two adult children. The patient is retired now and used to be a primary school teacher.   Presenting Problem: Mrs. S was admitted to our Emergency Department presenting with sudden and severe chest pain radiating to the left arm. The patient appeared excessively anxious and distressed.  Past Medical History: Mrs. S suffers from chronic anxiety and Type-2 diabetes. She underwent a hysterectomy at age 43 due to uterine fibroids. Her weight is within the normal limits  but she had history of smoking  which she quit 5 years ago. She has no history of cardiac issues  hypertension  stroke  or any other major illnesses.  Family History: Her mother died at the age of 76 due to myocardial infarction. Her older sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at 62. Her father had a stroke at 67 and died at 75. Besides  no known genetic disorders or illnesses are reported in her family.  Presenting Illness: Upon examination  she exhibited tachycardia  and an ECG showed ST elevation in the anterior leads correlating with acute coronary syndrome. Notably  coronary angiogram showed no significant coronary artery disease.  In view of Mrs. S's symptoms  ECG changes  and normal coronary arteries  the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken heart syndrome'  was made. Her chest pain started following news of her daughter's unexpected divorce. She experienced emotional stress leading to the manifestation of symptoms resembling a heart attack.  Management Plan: The patient was started on medications including beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and aspirin. Her diabetes and anxiety were managed with insulin and anxiolytics  respectively. Mrs. S was closely observed for any complications like heart failure  thrombus formation  arrhythmias  and rupture  which are potential risks in Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  An overall therapeutic approach  including cardiac rehabilitation and psychological support  was planned for Mrs. S. Family members were advised to provide emotional support. Patient education about the nature of her illness  the potential triggers  and the importance of stress management was also ensured.  By including this information  the case presentation is patient-centered and provides an overview of her personal  past medical  and family history relevant to the diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Furthermore  her management plan ensures a multidisciplinary approach focussing not only on the immediate cardiac issue but also on her mental and holistic health. 
15,9,83,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial83,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. S is a 64-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and palpitations.   Past Medical History:  Her past medical history includes controlled hypertension and chronic anxiety disorder. She has been taking enalapril and sertraline for these conditions respectively.   Complete Demographics:  She is a retired middle-school teacher  lives with her husband  and is financially stable. She is a non-smoker and has a history of social drinking. She is well nourished and her Body Mass Index (BMI) is 25.5 kg/m2.  Family History:  Her mother is deceased and died at the age of 68 from complications of breast cancer. Her father is still alive at the age of 84 and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Two of her three siblings have hypertension while the third one has type 2 diabetes. There is no reported family history of heart disease.  Details of Presenting Complaint:  Mrs. S indicated she experienced the chest pain while she was hearing news of her son's car accident. The accident was quite severe  but her son fortunately survived. It's clear that this event was a significant emotional stressor for her.  Clinical Examination:  Initial vital signs revealed a BP of 165/95  HR of 120 bpm  RR of 22 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation of 98% on room air  and a temperature of 98.7°F (37.1°C). Cardiovascular examination showed tachycardia with a regular rhythm  no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.   Investigations:  The initial ECG showed pronounced QT prolongation  and ST-segment elevation in leads II  III  AVF  V4  V5  and  V6  suggestive of possible acute coronary syndrome. However  the subsequent angiogram did not reveal any obstructive coronary artery disease. Cardio biomarkers were elevated with a peak Troponin I level of 2.6 ng/ml (normal <0.1 ng/ml) and a B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) of 650 pg/ml (normal <100 pg/ml). The echocardiogram showed apical ballooning with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%.   Diagnosis:  Based on her symptoms  the pattern of ECG changes  increased cardiac biomarkers  and characteristic echocardiographic findings  a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome) was made. This is often triggered by severe stress and is marked by temporary but severe heart muscle failure.  Management and Outcome:  Mrs. S was managed conservatively with continuation of her antihypertensive treatment  aspirin  and anxiety management. She gradually improved and was discharged after a week. At her one-month follow-up  Mrs. S was doing well with no chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations. Repeat echocardiogram showed returning of the LVEF back to normal at 60%.     This case emphasizes the impact of severe emotional stressors in precipitating cardiomyopathy  particularly in postmenopausal women with a history of mental health issues. Management is typically supportive and has a good prognosis if recognized and managed promptly.
15,9,84,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial84,"Patient Presentation  Ms. A  a 72-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath. She had a history of well-controlled hypertension on hydrochlorothiazide and no history of coronary artery disease  heart failure  or valvular heart disease. She has referred to having a relatively sedentary lifestyle  occasionally walking her dog. She has been taking oral atorvastatin for her moderately elevated cholesterol levels. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially.  One week ago  she suffered the sudden death of her childhood friend  which had a significant emotional impact on her. Over the past 24 hours  she began experiencing symptoms similar to a heart attack  including chest pressure  dyspnea  and fatigue  although she dismissed it initially as anxiety or stress.  Family medical history is unremarkable  and there's no family history of premature coronary disease or cardiomyopathies. On physical examination  she was tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure was 137/90  and respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. She seemed to be distressed but was well-oriented to time  place  and person.  ECG showed ST-segment elevations in the anterolateral leads  which initially suggested an acute myocardial infarction; however  subsequent angiography revealed no significant blockages or coronary artery disease. Echocardiogram showed reduced left ventricular function with an ejection fraction estimated at approximately 40% with peculiar apical ballooning pattern of the left ventricle  but with preserved basal function.  Considering her symptoms  timing of presentation  lack of significant findings on coronary angiography  as well as echo findings  she was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome"""").   Her stress cardiomyopathy was likely precipitated by emotional stress from her friend's death. Ms. A was started on beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors therapy to help improve her ventricular function. Patient education was also provided on the nature of her condition  such as its usual occurrence in post-menopausal women  that it is often precipitated by intense physical or emotional stress  and the prognosis is generally favorable with complete recovery of ventricular function in most patients.   The challenge remains that recurrent events  although rare  may occur in the face of future stressors  which is why interventions aimed at stress management could be beneficial in paralleling the medical treatment."
15,9,85,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial85,"Case Presentation:  Patient Details: Ms. L  a 65-year-old woman  primary language Spanish  who emigrated from Mexico 30 years ago. She lives with her eldest son and his family. She has two other children who live in the same city.  Past Medical History: She has a past medical history of hypertension controlled well on medication  diabetes mellitus type 2 managed with diet and metformin  as well as a recent diagnosis of major depression following the sudden death of her husband a year ago. She has no history of CAD  heart failure  or valvular disease. She is a non-smoker and follows a healthy vegetarian diet. She denies any history of recreational drug use.  Family History: Her father had coronary artery disease and had experienced a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. Her mother was healthy and lived to the age of 82. She has two brothers  one of whom is hypertensive and the other is healthy.  Presenting Problem: She was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute onset severe chest pain radiating to her jaw accompanied by dyspnea. The pain was intense  crushing  and sustained; she marked it as 8 on a scale of 10  indicating a feeling of severe discomfort.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  she was in obvious distress but conscious and oriented. Her blood pressure was 140/88 mm Hg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 22 per minute  and temperature 98.6°F. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular rhythm with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Lungs were clear on auscultation  and no lower extremity edema was observed.  Lab investigations: Her lab tests indicated slightly elevated white cell count and a spike in cardiac Troponin I. An ECG recorded ST segment elevation in the precordial leads  and emergent cardiac catheterization demonstrated no coronary artery obstruction.  Diagnosis and Management: Based on her symptoms  presentation  and clinical findings; a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made. She was started on aspirin  ACE inhibitors  beta-blockers  and statins. Supportive treatment such as oxygen therapy tailored to keep oxygen saturation above 94% was initiated. Additionally  physical rehabilitation and psychiatric consultation were ordered for management of depression and to provide emotional support.  Further Recommendations: It is crucial to manage the patient's stress and depression  potentially adjusting her medication and incorporating other supportive therapies. Regular follow-ups are necessary for closer monitoring of the patient's overall health and heart status.   Discussion: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is also known as """"Broken heart syndrome""""  often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. Ms. L's recent widowhood and major depression may have been catalysts for her condition. This case illustrates the importance of addressing not only physical health but mental health as well  and the interconnected nature of the body and mind."
15,9,86,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial86,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Johnson  a 68-year-old Asian female  presented to the emergency department for shortness of breath  chest pain  and weakness for the last two days. She currently lives with her daughter and is retired  with no history of tobacco  alcohol  or illicit substances use.  Past Medical History:  She has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  managed with metformin  and Hypertension  controlled by amlodipine. She also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and takes a regular inhaler. She sustained a low-energy hip fracture four years ago and underwent surgical repair. There is no known history of coronary artery disease  cerebrovascular accident  or any hematological or autoimmune disorders.  Family History:  Her mother died at 80 years of age due to a stroke. Her father died at the age of 83 from heart disease. She has one brother who is alive and healthy and another who passed away following complications of diabetes.  Clinical Examination:  Ms. Johnson’s vitals showed a heart rate of 110 bpm  blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  oxygen saturation of 94% on room air  and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. On examination  her chest was clear to auscultation  heart sounds were regular with no added sounds  but mild tenderness was noticed on pressing the lower sternal area.  Investigations:  Cardiac troponin levels were equivocal  but an electrocardiogram showed new T wave inversion in leads V1-V4. Her fasting blood sugar level and HbA1C were within the normal level. The chest X-ray was normal.  Echocardiography revealed a dilated left ventricle with apical ballooning  reduced ejection fraction of around 45%  and no significant valvular abnormalities  which suggested the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Case Summary:  Given her recent stress of coping with her increasing current illness symptoms  her ECG changes  echocardiographic findings  and lack of significant atherosclerotic disease  Ms. Johnson was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy. This condition predominantly affects post-menopausal women and is often preceded by physical or emotional stress. The possibility of a bereavement or emotional trauma leading to this condition is yet to be confirmed.  Management Plan:  Ms. Johnson was managed with supportive care  including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. Cardiac rehabilitation services were engaged  and mental health services were involved due to the known association with emotional stressors. The importance of regular follow-up and strict adherence to medication were explained to her and her family.  Given her diabetes  hypertension  and COPD  the multidisciplinary team stressed the importance of tight control of these conditions to help improve her cardiac condition. Also  her family was educated about the early signs of future cardiac episodes to ensure prompt intervention.
15,9,87,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial87,Patient Profile: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian female  named Mrs. Smith  who has recently been widowed. Patient came to the emergency department reporting chest discomfort soon after hearing the news of her husband's death. She is a non-smoker with a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type-II. She has been compliant with her medication. There is no record of any drug allergies. Her family history is notable for cardiovascular disease  where both her father and grandfather succumbed to a myocardial infarction.  Presentation: Mrs. Smith presented with symptoms of acute chest pain  dyspnea and mild perspiration. The pain was described as ‘like an elephant was sitting on her chest ’ radiating to her left arm. She denied any nausea  vomiting or syncope  but admitted feeling lightheaded and dizzy.   Physical Examination: Physical examination was generally unremarkable with no abnormalities detected in the lung or abdominal examination. Cardiovascular examination revealed a mildly tachycardic heart rate but no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.   Diagnostic Tests: An electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  concerning for an acute coronary syndrome  while her initial troponin levels were also elevated. The coronary angiogram was performed which showed no significant occlusive disease to suggest a myocardial infarction. Echocardiogram demonstrated a significant reduction in the left ventricular (LV) systolic function and the classic 'apical ballooning' pattern of the LV  which is consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment and Outcome: Mrs. Smith was treated with heart failure medications  including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. The patient was also advised on the importance of emotional and social support for her severe emotional stress  and a referral was made for grief counseling. She was discharged after 5 days in stable condition.   Follow-up: At the two-month follow-up  the patient showed significant improvement in her symptoms. A repeat echocardiogram demonstrated recovery of the left ventricular systolic function  confirming the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient continues to engage in grief counseling  and is following up routinely with cardiology.  Discussion: This case was a classic presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome.' It is a temporary heart condition often brought on by stressful situations  as seen in our widowed patient. The diagnostic challenge here lies in distinguishing this condition from an acute myocardial infarction  as both can present with similar symptoms and EKG changes. 
15,9,88,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial88,Patient Presentation:  Patient: Mrs. A  a 63-year-old Caucasian female  Presenting Complaint: Acute onset of severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations. Past Medical History: Hypertension for last 10 years  managed by antihypertensives. History of anxiety and depression. No history of ischemic heart disease. Non-smoker. Family History: Mother suffered from a heart attack aged 70.   Clinical Presentation:   Mrs. A presented to the emergency department following an acute onset of severe chest pain that radiated to the left arm. She reported that the pain was similar to a sensation of “pressure” and was accompanied by shortness of breath and palpitations. She commented that the episode of pain had begun several hours after hearing of her brother's unexpected death.   On arrival  her blood pressure was elevated at 180/105mmHg  with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturations were 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed anxiety  diaphoresis  and slight pallor but no other significant cardiovascular or respiratory findings. The heart sounds were regular without murmurs  rubs  or gallops. There were no clinical features of heart failure  such as pulmonary crackles or peripheral edema.  Investigations:   Initial blood investigations revealed elevated cardiac Troponin I at 2.0-ng/mL (reference range <0.04-ng/mL) confirming myocardial injury. ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anteroseptal leads  suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome.   However  a subsequent coronary angiogram did not show significant atherosclerotic disease. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle during systole  along with hyperkinesis of the basal segments of the left ventricle  suggesting Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment:  The patient was initially treated with IV nitroglycerin for blood pressure and pain control  statins  and aspirin considering the possibility of acute coronary syndrome. Post-diagnosis  she was maintained on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors to manage the blood pressure and stress cardiomyopathy.  Outcome:  Mrs. A’s symptoms gradually improved over the following days with the conservative medical management. A repeat echocardiogram after 8 weeks showed complete resolution of the left ventricular function  confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   The patient was counseled about stress management and was referred to a psychiatrist for the management of her anxiety and depression. Close cardiology follow up was arranged to monitor her blood pressure and cardiovascular status.
15,9,89,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial89,Patient Presentation:  Name: Maria Sanchez  Age: 65 years  Gender: Female  Occupation: Retired teacher  Residence: Los Angeles  California  Case History: Mrs. Sanchez is a Hispanic woman aged 65 with known hypertension for which she is taking medication  and no known allergies.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented with sudden chest pain  shortness of breath  and lightheadedness  mimicking a heart attack. Mrs. Sanchez also mentioned she has been experiencing severe emotional stress due to the sudden demise of her husband two weeks prior. These symptoms started after she had a heated argument on the phone with an insurance company representative.  Family History: No significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. Her father had Type-2 diabetes and her mother had hypertension. She has two children  both healthy. Her husband suddenly passed away due to an undiagnosed health condition.  Clinical Assessment: On observation  Mrs. Sanchez was anxious  with a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg  pulse rate of 110 bpm  and respiratory rate of 20 bpm. Cardiac auscultations revealed no murmur. An initial ECG showed ST-segment elevation. There was no evidence of any blockage in the coronary arteries. An echocardiogram was performed  and it demonstrated apical ballooning consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis: Based on the presenting symptoms  clinical findings  echocardiography  and the absence of blocked arteries  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made.  Management Plan: The patient was admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment. She was started on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. A follow-up echocardiogram was scheduled to determine recovery progress and adjust medications as needed. Mental health support was also offered to help cope with her recent emotional stressors. Long term  the patient will be advised regarding lifestyle modification and regular follow-ups.   Although Mrs. Sanchez’s diagnosis is one of a severe heart condition  the prognosis for takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally good  especially combined with mental health support to manage emotional stress. As per her case  the main focus would be managing her health and ensuring complete recovery through regular follow-ups  medication  and stress management.
15,9,90,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial90,"Patient Case Presentation:  Patient Overview: Ms. K.  a 61-year old Caucasian female  was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain was described as pressure-like  radiating towards left arm and jaw  worsening over a few hours. She rated her pain as 9 out of 10 on a visual analogue scale. Her past history is significant for hypertension and diabetes. She has no known allergies. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her family history revealed a paternal grandfather with a myocardial infarction at an early age  but no other significant findings.  Clinical Manifestations: Ms. K. was pale  anxious  and diaphoretic on presentation. Her blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg  heart rate of 98 bpm  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. On physical examination  there were no murmurs or additional heart sounds. Her breath sounds were normal  and her extremities were cool to the touch.   Investigation and Diagnosis: 12-Lead EKG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads with prominent T wave inversions  suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. However  coronary angiography did not reveal any significant obstructive coronary disease. Troponin levels were elevated. Echocardiogram showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle with the base contracting normally  consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM).  Ms. K reported that she had been under significant social stress due to her spouse’s recent death which might have precipitated takotsubo cardiomyopathy. TCM  sometimes called """"broken heart syndrome """" often presents with symptoms similar to a heart attack  but it's precipitated by intense emotional or physical trauma.  Management and Outcome: She was managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  beta-blockers and provided supportive care. She remained in the critical care unit under close monitoring for her unstable hemodynamics. Her chest pain subsided on second day of her admission. Repeat echocardiogram at the end of one week showed improving left ventricular systolic function.   Ms. K. was able to gradually return to her daily activities after a month of her hospital admission. She was relieved to be reassured of her health status. Behavioral health consultations were made for grief counseling  and she was encouraged to seek support to manage her stress.  Discussion: In patients presenting with acute chest pain  it is important to include takotsubo cardiomyopathy in differential diagnosis  especially if the patient has been experiencing significant stress or emotional trauma  and when no significant coronary artery obstruction is found. Although the prognosis for TCM is often good with proper supportive treatment and stress management  prevention includes effective stress management  mental health wellness  and appropriate therapy for acute stress reactions.

15,9,92,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial92,Patient Information:   Mrs. Johnson  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  was brought to the emergency department exhibiting severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She lives alone in her house and is a retired high school teacher.   Medical History:   Mrs. Johnson is a non-smoker but has been battling obesity  with a BMI standing at 30.9. She has a history of being hypertensive and diabetic for the past eight years. Mrs. Johnson also suffers from occasional anxiety and panic disorders  usually managed with medicines and therapies. She had a minor fall incident at home three weeks before where she fractured her right wrist. She had a trying time coping with the physical and emotional pain following the incident  which could have resulted in increased stress.  Family History:   Her family history is significant for coronary artery disease as her father deceased from a myocardial infarction at age 75  and her mother suffered from heart failure. She has a younger brother who is presently being treated for hypertension and diabetes.  Current Presentation:  On arrival to the emergency department  Mrs. Johnson appeared extremely anxious and was hyperventilating. Her vital signs revealed tachycardia (heart rate of 115 beats per minute)  blood pressure of 165/98 mmHg  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation of 96% on room air and temperature of 37.1°C. Physical examination revealed mild respiratory distress.  Clinical Assessment:  After appropriate management was initiated including oxygen therapy  her ECG showed signs indicative of anterior wall myocardial infarction  however  blood tests surprisingly showed only slightly raised troponin levels  inconsistent with typical myocardial infarction. She was immediately referred for coronary angiography which surprisingly  showed normal coronary arteries.  Considering her recent traumatic event and the combination of symptoms and findings  a working diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (or 'broken heart syndrome') was suggested. This was confirmed with 2D echocardiography that revealed segmental ventricular wall motion abnormality along with apical ballooning of the left ventricle  typical findings of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Patient Management:   Mrs. Johnson was admitted to the cardiac care unit for close monitoring. She was treated with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for managing her hypertensive condition. Additionally  she was administered aspirin and low molecular weight heparin as primary prevention for coronary artery disease. An important part of her treatment was also to monitor and manage her stress and anxiety levels. A team of psychologists was called in to help her deal with her feelings associated with her recent accident.  This case essentially reminds us of the impact of emotional health on physical well-being and the significance of heart-brain connections.
15,9,93,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial93,"Patient Details: The patient is a 70-year old Caucasian female with a medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type II diabetes mellitus. She is a widow and a retired school teacher with moderate alcohol use history and she has a 40-pack year smoking history  though she quit two years ago. She has two adult children who are healthy. Her family history is notable for cardiovascular disease  with her father dying from myocardial infarction at age 67 and her mother had a stroke in her late 70s.  Presenting Problem: The patient was brought in to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe chest pain that she described as """"crushing """" accompanied by shortness of breath  and rated the pain 8 out of 10 in intensity. The patient reported that these symptoms began abruptly while she was visiting her husband’s grave – a ritual she began two weeks after his unexpected death two months before.  Examination: In the emergency department  the patient was anxious and in evident distress. Her blood pressure was elevated (160/95 mmHg)  heart rate was 140 beats per minute  and her oxygen saturation on room air was 92%. She was acutely breathless with visible perspiration and was noted to be cyanotic.  Investigations: An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed significant ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads with reciprocal depressions in the inferior leads. Lab results found a significant troponin elevation of 10 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL)  and her D-dimer level was raised. A chest X-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.  Treatment: The patient was initially treated with aspirin  sublingual nitroglycerin  and oxygen  followed by a loading dose of clopidogrel  and was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization lab.  Diagnosis: Coronary angiography showed no obstructive coronary disease. Left ventriculography  however  revealed typical """"apical ballooning """" with hyper-kinesia of the base and severe hypokinesis of the midventricle and apex  leading to a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome.""""  Outcome: The patient's condition gradually improved over the next few days with supportive treatment. She was started on a beta-blocker (carvedilol) and ACE inhibitors for afterload reduction. A repeat echocardiogram after two weeks showed significant improvement in the left ventricular function. She was then referred for grief counselling and psychiatric help. The short-term prognosis for takotsubo cardiomyopathy is excellent but patients are at a risk of recurrence and long-term complications. This case emphasizes the importance of considering takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a differential diagnosis in elderly females presenting with chest pain and emotional stress.   This case also emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to patient care that includes addressing mental health and emotional well-being."
15,9,94,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial94,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Susan  a 55-year-old Caucasian female  presented herself to the emergency room with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She rates her pain as 8/10  describing it as a crushing sensation. She also reports associated symptoms of nausea and origination of pain from the lower sternum. She has never experienced these symptoms before.   Past Medical History:   Prior to her current symptoms  Ms. Susan generally enjoyed good health with no significant medical conditions or prior hospitalizations. She has no history of high blood pressure  diabetes  or significant heart disease. However  she has been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and has been on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the past five years. She is a non-smoker but admits to occasional alcohol use.  Family History:   She lives alone  as she is divorced with two grown-up kids. She also mentioned that her mother had a heart attack at the age of 60 and her father was diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Social History:  She works as a high school teacher. Recent changes in her work schedule due to implementation of virtual learning has significantly increased her stress level. She reported her stress to be significantly high for the past few months.   Emergency Room Visit:  During this acute episode of chest discomfort  EKG was ordered which demonstrated a prolonged QT interval. Her Troponin level was slightly elevated  which along with her symptoms  led us to suspect acute coronary syndrome. However  coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease. The left ventriculogram showed apical ballooning with reduced ejection fraction  features consistent with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome).   Clinical Impression:  Ms. Susan's severe chest pain  elevated Troponin level  and EKG changes initially presented a picture similar to acute myocardial infarction. However  the absence of significant coronary artery disease and the peculiar finding of apical ballooning on ventriculogram demonstrated that she was dealing with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  The elevated stress level that she has been experiencing due to her work situation possibly had a significant role in her current cardiomyopathy. Management would include resolving her current symptoms  ensuring heart recovery and dealing with her excessive stress level.   Follow up is recommended to monitor the status of her heart function and mental health. It is also important to educate Ms. Susan about the significance of managing her stress level and maintaining a healthy lifestyle to prevent any future occurrences.

She has two adult children who live out of state. She has a history of hypertension and a relatively sedentary lifestyle.  Chief Complaint: Patient presented at the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain resembling a heart attack. This occurred suddenly while she was dealing with the funeral arrangements of her deceased husband.  Medical History: The patient has been on medication for hypertension for the last ten years. She also takes daily low-dose aspirin on the advice of her previous physician. The patient was previously diagnosed with mild obesity. However  it was under control and she does some mild exercises at home. The patient has no history of smoking or excessive alcohol use. Her diet is predominantly plant-based  with occasional fish and poultry. There is no known history of allergies.  Family History: Mother suffered a heart attack at the age of 70 and father died of cancer. The patient's older brother has a history of stroke. There is a strong genetic predisposition to cardiovascular diseases in her family.  Physical Examination and Diagnosis: Physical examination was significant for slightly elevated blood pressure and mild bilateral ankle edema. Initial EKG showed ST-elevation  mimicking the presentation of an acute myocardial infarction. However  on performing angiography  no significant coronary artery occlusion was identified.   The left ventricular (LV) angiogram showed apical ballooning  a classic feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Troponin levels were mildly elevated. Echocardiogram revealed akinesis of the apical and mid segments of the left ventricle  with hyperkinesis of basal segments  giving the typical takotsubo or 'Octopus trap' appearance. Given the patient's recent emotional stress  a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made.  Treatment and Recommendations: The patient was hospitalized and provided with supportive care. She was prescribed beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors  and her previous anti-hypertensive medications were continued. She was also referred to a psychologist to address her bereavement and potential depression. The importance of following a heart-healthy diet and regular exercise were emphasized to the patient.   Careful follow-up was arranged  with repeat echocardiography after four weeks. The patient was educated about her condition  instructed about the signs of possible complications like heart failure  and advised to come to the hospital immediately if symptoms like chest pain  shortness of breath or fainting episodes occur.
15,9,96,diagnosis15-prompt9-trial96,Patient Profile Name: Mrs. Johnson Age: 65 years Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Past Medical History: Hypertension  Hyperthyroidism  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Johnson presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain. It started suddenly during be night and persisted. The pain is described as sharp  localized at the center of the chest  and radiates to the left arm. She rates it 8/10 in severity.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Johnson is known to suffer from hypertension for the past 15 years and hyperthyroidism was diagnosed 5 years ago. Both conditions are managed on medication. She also suffered a mild TIA (transient ischemic attack) two years ago with complete recovery. Mrs. Johnson had no prior history of heart disease confirmed via normal echocardiograms in the past.  Family History: Both her father and older brother suffered from coronary artery disease in their late 60s. Her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 50.  Lifestyle: Mrs. Johnson is a retired librarian  non-smoker  and occasional drinker. She lives alone and mentioned feeling depressed after the death of her husband 7 months ago.  Diagnosis: Based on her symptoms  ECG changes and imaging studies  Mrs. Johnson was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome). This  in her case  could be linked to the intense emotional stress she has been experiencing.  Investigations: Her ECG on arrival showed ST-segment elevation and troponin levels were elevated. Echocardiography revealed reduced left ventricular systolic function and hypokinesis of the mid to apical segments of left ventricle  giving it an apical ballooning appearance- a distinctive feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment & Progress: Mrs. Johnson was admitted to the cardiac care unit. She received treatment with beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and supportive therapy. Her chest pain resolved over time and repeat imaging after 2 weeks showed much improvement in her left ventricular function. She also received psychological support from the mental health team.  This case emphasizes the intriguing connection between emotional stress and cardiac conditions  specifically Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It is also crucial to differentiate it from Acute Coronary Syndrome because of similar presentations but entirely different management approaches.

Chief Complaint:  Mrs. Smith complains of severe chest pain and shortness of breath.  Present Illness:  The patient began to feel unwell  experiencing severe chest pain  after receiving news about the sudden death of her brother  to which she was extremely close. She presented to the emergency department when her symptoms persisted.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Smith has a history of hypertension  for which she has been prescribed medications. She also suffers from anxiety and diabetes mellitus. She neither smokes nor drinks alcohol.   Family History:  Patient’s mother had coronary artery disease and died at the age of 64 due to a sudden heart attack.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  Mrs. Smith appears anxious. She has a blood pressure of 152/90  pulse 110  and respirations 22. Her cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rhythm with no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Diagnostic Testing:  Mrs. Smith's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  and her troponin levels are elevated. Left ventriculogram reveals a unique shape of left ventricle with a narrow neck (apex) and wide base (left ventricular outflow tract)  known as apical ballooning  which is typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Diagnosis:  Mrs. Smith is diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome."""" This condition is often triggered by severe stress and presents with symptoms similar to a heart attack  but without the coronary artery blockages that typically cause a heart attack.   Management:  The management involved supportive care with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  β-blockers  and diuretics to relieve symptoms and avoid further heart damage. The patient's condition improved gradually  but she will need to control her hypertension better  manage her diabetes  and reduce her stress levels. A consult for a cardiac rehabilitation program was made  and the patient was also referred to psychotherapy and stress management sessions due to her history of anxiety and stress-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Conclusion:  The patient was discharged with instructions for regular follow-ups  along with continuing her medications  and implementing lifestyle changes for better stress management. It was also recommended she seek immediate medical attention if similar symptoms were to occur again."

She is a widow  living alone in her apartment in New York. She is a retired schoolteacher and has two adult children  who are both doing well in their respective professions. She has been relatively active socially and takes pride in her work with a local charity organization. She has a past medical history of Type 2 Diabetes  which she has been managing for five years with dietary control and Metformin.   Ms. AA's medical family history reveals that her mother had a history of behavioural disorder  her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 75  and her brother is alive and is taking treatment for Prostate Cancer. There is no history of any cardiac diseases in her immediate family.  Ms. AA has limited alcohol consumption  and she quit smoking 20 years ago. She is also suffering from hypertension  which has been well controlled with beta-blocker medication for the last ten years. She has had good cholesterol control with a statin since her diagnosis of diabetes.  One day  she presented to the Emergency Department with chest pain  breathlessness  and an impending sense of doom triggered by the news that her childhood friend had passed away. On examination  she looked pale  anxious  and her vital signs show a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg  pulse rate 110  respiratory rate of 18/minute  and oxygen saturation 94% without oxygen supplementation.  Ms. AA quickly underwent a series of tests: her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. The troponin level was elevated at 0.88 ng/ml (normal range <0.04 ng/ml)  which suggest myocardial injury. Echocardiography was performed  which showed characteristic left ventricular apical ballooning with preserved basal function  indicating a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as """"Broken Heart Syndrome"""".  The timing of Ms. AA’s symptoms (occurring after a stressful event)  ST-segment elevations on ECG  elevated troponin levels  and characteristic echocardiographic findings confirm the diagnosis. She has been admitted and was managed with Aspirin  beta-blockers  and ACE inhibitors. She responded well to the management  and her symptoms resolved over three days. She will be followed up in cardiology outpatients clinic in two weeks for monitoring her echocardiogram and to address her emotional well-being  given the event that triggered her symptoms.   While Ms. AA's diagnosis was unexpected  given she didn’t have any personal history of heart disease  it is not unusual for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy to be precipitated by an episode of severe emotional stress. There is no specific treatment for this syndrome  and management is largely supportive  with beta-blockers likely to reduce the occurrence of further episodes. She will require constant monitoring and management of emotional well-being as an integral part of her therapeutic approach."

She does not have any known cardiorespiratory diseases  and she has been maintaining a healthy lifestyle with balanced nutrition and regular light exercises. She has normal blood pressure and her body mass index is in the normal range.  Presenting Complaints: Ms. A was brought to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath that started suddenly about an hour ago. The pain was intense and felt like """"a heavy weight on her chest"""". It apparently developed while she was attending a memorial service of her late husband. She describes it as the most severe chest pain she has ever experienced and rates it as a 10 on a scale of 0 to 10  with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. Along with the pain  she also felt nauseated and anxious.   On arrival at the emergency department  the blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  the heart rate was 110 beats/minute  respiratory rate was 22 breaths/minute and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air.  This sudden onset of chest pain in a postmenopausal woman and the physical findings necessitates a thorough cardiovascular evaluation  keeping in mind the differential diagnoses of acute coronary syndrome  pulmonary embolism and takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Further diagnostic tests to be ordered include ECG  cardiac biomarkers  chest x-ray  transthoracic echocardiogram and possibly coronary angiogram.

15,10,4,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial4,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics:  Name: Mrs. Nancy Edwards Age: 68 years old Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Teacher Marital Status: Widowed  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Edwards has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. All were well-controlled on medication (Losartan/Hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia). Other than this  her medical history is unremarkable. She does not smoke  drinks alcohol occasionally  and has a BMI of 25. Her family history consists of coronary artery diseases  with her father succumbing to myocardial infarction at the age of 72.  Key Complaints:  Mrs. Edwards presented to the emergency department with sudden and severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. The pain began suddenly while she was at her husband's funeral. She describes it as a heavy squeezing sensation and rates it an 8 out of 10 on the pain scale. The pain is accompanied by feelings of anxiety  shortness of breath  and she has also experienced a few episodes of vomiting. Additionally  she mentions that the pain did not relieve with rest.  On examination  she was distressed and showing signs of moderate respiratory distress. ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Troponin levels were slightly elevated.   Given her symptoms  ECG changes  and raised troponin levels  an acute coronary syndrome was originally suspected. But  following a coronary angiogram  there was no evidence of significant coronary artery disease that would cause her symptoms and ECG changes.   An echocardiogram demonstrated apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesis of the base  consistent with a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. Her symptoms  triggered by emotional stress  combined with the characteristic echocardiogram findings  confirmed the diagnosis.   The case of Mrs. Edwards was a typical presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  observed predominantly in postmenopausal women after a severe emotional stressor. It is important to differentiate Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from other forms of acute coronary syndrome since its management plan differs.
15,10,5,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial5,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information:  Mrs. A  a 78-year-old retired school teacher  presented to the emergency department. She is of Asian descent  resistant to hypertension for the past decade  and has a known history of situational anxiety. She lives with her older daughter and is a widow for the last 15 years.  Past Medical History:  Apart from hypertension  Mrs. A has been generally healthy for her age. She is a non-smoker and doesn't drink alcohol. She has no known allergies. She is under a regular regime of Lisinopril  a medication for her hypertension  and takes anxiolytic medication as needed.  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. A arrived with complaints of sudden onset  severe chest pain  and shortness of breath that started a few hours after hearing about her younger daughter's car accident. She describes her chest pain similar to a heaviness associated with profuse sweating. She denies any nausea or vomiting or pain radiating to the arms or jaw. The symptoms were not alleviated with rest or nitroglycerin.  Review of systems was otherwise unremarkable  with no recent symptoms of viral illness  unexplained syncope  or changes in weight or appetite. Family history reveals her mother suffered from coronary artery disease.  Conclusion:  The unusual trigger  symptomology  and patient's demographic suggest a possible case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. An ECG  blood tests for cardiac enzymes  and an echocardiogram are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and initiate the appropriate management.  Overall  the case illustrates the need to consider Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis when an older female patient presents with acute chest pain after a significant emotional stressor. The case can also be used to discuss the relevance of psychological factors in the manifestation of physical conditions.
15,10,6,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial6,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics:  A 68-year-old Asian woman  retired teacher  widowed one year ago  non-smoker with a history of moderate alcohol use. Currently lives alone and managing her daily living activities.  Past medical history:  The patient has been generally healthy with no significant medical issues. She has a history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the last 10 years. She does not have any history of mental health conditions  surgical interventions  or known allergies.   Key Complaints:  The patient presents to the Emergency Department complaining of acute onset chest pain  described as a pressure-like feeling radiating to the left arm that started approximately 2 hours ago while she was involved in an intense argument with her neighbor. She associates the pain with shortness of breath  light-headedness  and nausea  similar to what she thinks a heart attack would feel like. She denies any cough  fever  or recent illnesses. She also mentions feeling increased levels of stress and loneliness since her husband's demise one year ago.  Conclusion: This case provides a classical scenario of an elderly woman with takotsubo cardiomyopathy - also known as broken heart syndrome - triggered by an acute stressor. The key emphasis is to recognize that despite no significant medical history  the patient's age  gender  post-menopausal status  and recent emotional stress can predispose her to this condition. The symptoms can closely mimic those of a heart attack and require immediate medical intervention.

Hyperthyroidism: Resolved and monitored with periodic blood tests.  Key complaints:  Mrs. H visited the Emergency Department with the primary complaint of chest pain which she described as """"a heaviness on her chest"""" that started suddenly while she was attending her daughter's wedding  an emotionally overwhelming event. The pain did not radiate but was accompanied by shortness of breath. She also reported feeling light-headed and having cold sweats.   The chest pain raised concern of myocardial infarction  however  she has no history of coronary artery disease. EKG showed ST-segment elevation which further pointed towards a heart attack  but subsequent angiography ruled out significant coronary artery occlusion characteristic of myocardial ischemia. Echocardiography  however  showed ballooning and dyskinesis of the left ventricular apex along with hyperkinesis of the basal walls - features suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Her emotional stress preceding the symptoms  along with the typical """"octopus pot"""" appearance of her left ventricular during systole  supported the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""".   This case would help students understand a unique non-ischemic cardiomyopathy  its triggers  symptoms and its diagnostic criteria which differentiates it from an acute myocardial infarction.

15,10,8,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial8,Patient Demographics: Mrs. Jodi  a 63-year-old Caucasian female  who works as an elementary school teacher. She is a non-smoker and leads a relatively active lifestyle. She is pre-diabetic  with a BMI of 28. She lives alone  being recently widowed. Since her husband's recent passing  she has been suffering from intermittent episodes of anxiety and acute depression  managed primarily with supportive therapy.  Past Medical History: Stable pre-diabetes managed through diet and regular physical activity; no ongoing medications. Over the past five years  she has moderately high cholesterol levels for which she is not on any medication. Family history includes her father dying early from a heart attack. She has no history of cardiac disease  hypertension  or other chronic medical conditions.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Jodi was at school when she began to have a sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain is retrosternal  radiating to the left arm and neck  and is associated with profuse sweating. She rated her pain as an 8 out of 10. She had been feeling generally stressed that day due to parent-teacher conferences. She initially dismissed it as anxiety but due to chest discomfort and shortness of breath  she was brought to the Emergency Department.   On initial analysis  her symptoms appeared to mimic those of a heart attack but a differential diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as 'broken-heart syndrome' or 'stress cardiomyopathy'  might need to be considered in light of her recent emotional stressors and lack of atherosclerotic risk factors. The significant emotional stress could have sparked the chest pain leading to 'broken heart syndrome.' Prompt diagnosis and monitoring of her condition are vital.   This case provides an opportunity to discuss how emotional stress can adversely affect the heart  the pathophysiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  its clinical presentation  and its diagnostic criteria. The case also highlights the importance of the mind-body connection in understanding and managing diseases.

Ms. Alvarez experienced recent bereavement losing her husband of 50 years three months ago.  Presenting Complaints:  Ms. Alvarez presented to the emergency department with acute-onset chest pain. She describes it as a severe  constricting pain that started a few hours ago. The pain does not radiate and is associated with shortness of breath. She also reported feeling light-headed with a brief spell of syncope at home. She denies having fever  nausea  or vomiting but has been experiencing decreased appetite and frequent episodes of crying due to the recent loss of her spouse.  Objective Assessment:  Vital Signs: Blood Pressure - 165/88 mmHg  Heart Rate - 102 beats per minute  Respiratory Rate - 22 breaths per minute  Temperature - 98.6-degree Fahrenheit  Oxygen saturation - 96% on room air.  Skin: Normal  no obvious cyanosis or pallor.  CVS: Tachycardic  no murmur  or added sounds. The pulses are good volume and all peripheral pulses are palpable.  Respiratory: Bilaterally clear  no added sounds.  CNS: Conscious  oriented  no focal neurological deficits.  A 12-Lead ECG shows ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads suggesting acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. However  the history and ECG changes are more suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to the recent emotional stress the patient has had.   The next steps would involve obtaining a blood test for cardiac enzymes and performing an echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It will also help plan the future course of management. The patient also needs to be educated about her condition and needs immediate intervention  including monitoring of vital signs  medications  and emotional support to help her manage stress.

Past Medical History: The patient is a nonsmoker  rarely consumes alcohol  and has no known drug allergies. She has a past medical history of hypertension  which is being managed with Lisinopril. The patient suffered a loss in the family around one month ago and has been under chronic stress whilst dealing with the loss.  Key Complaints: The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain that radiates to the left arm  accompanied by shortness of breath. She describes the pain as """"crushing"""" and mentions it started while she was gardening at home. She reports a sense of impending doom and states it feels worse than any chest pain she has experienced before. The pain lasted approximately 30 minutes and did not improve with rest. She decided to come to the hospital because she was concerned she may be having a heart attack.  On physical exam  her blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg  heart rate was 82 bpm  respiratory rate was 20 bpm  and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Bibasilar crackles were noted on lung auscultation  the heart sounds were rhythmic with no murmur  and no jugular venous distention was present. The remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable.  This case should prompt students to consider Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart syndrome""""  as one of the differential diagnoses for a patient presenting with chest pain and distress. The key clues in this case include the severe emotional stress the patient has been experiencing and the presentation mimicking an acute coronary syndrome. Factors including age  sex (female)  and postmenopausal status should also steer towards this diagnosis.   This case can provoke discussion on clinical presentation  key diagnostic strategies (including EKG  cardiac biomarkers  and echocardiogram)  a comparison to myocardial infarction  and methods of management in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."

Currently under stress due to the recent death of her husband.  Presenting Complaints: Ms. Lewis presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of severe chest pain after hearing of the sudden death of her husband. The symptom started a couple of hours post the distressing news characterized by intense pressure in the chest area. The pain resembled a sharp  'stabbing' sensation around the heart. She also mentioned experiencing mild shortness of breath and a feeling of impending doom.  Physical Examination: On arrival at the ED: BP: 150/90mmHg  HR: 110 bpm  RR: 22 breaths per minute  Temp: 37.2°C  SpO2: 96% on room air. She appeared distressed and anxious.  Training Focus: The case should underline the connection between sudden emotional trauma and the onset of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It should allow students to interpret clinical and diagnostic findings pertinent to this condition  such as transient left ventricular apical ballooning  ST-segment elevation on ECG mimicking an acute myocardial infarction  and the presence of only minimal coronary artery disease on angiography. An understanding of the distinctive features of this disease can help students effectively differentiate it from other cardiac diseases with similar symptoms  hence directing to an appropriate management strategy in a timely manner.  Critical Points: 1. The link between emotional stress and takotsubo cardiomyopathy 2. The ability to differentiate between takotsubo cardiomyopathy and acute myocardial infarction 3. Understanding the role of diagnostic tests (ECG  echocardiogram  coronary angiogram) in making the proper diagnosis 4. Recognizing the importance of managing the underlying cause of emotional stress for complete recovery.

The next steps would involve further diagnostic testing such as EKG  echocardiography  cardiac magnetic resonance imaging  and possibly cardiac catheterization to rule out an acute coronary syndrome and establish the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The long-term management of Mrs. L's case would likely involve closely monitoring her cardiovascular health and possibly pharmacological therapy  depending on the severity of her presentation. Psycho-social support would also be a vital consideration given the emotional stressors present in this case."
15,10,28,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial28,"Patient Information:  Sarah Adams  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  was brought into the emergency room.  Chief Complaint:  Experiencing acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath.  Past Medical History:  Non-smoker and non-alcoholic. History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which she has been assisted with medications. Her family history includes a mother who experienced myocardial infarction at age 72.   Event History:  Mrs. Adams's symptoms began surprisingly during a particularly stressful family event occurring the same day. The family dispute led to an intense argument where Mrs. Adams reported she felt """"overwhelmed """" """"stressed"""" and """"extremely anxious."""" She reported feeling an acute  severe chest pain shortly after the argument.  Upon assessment  she more specifically described the pain as a heavy sensation  located centrally in her chest  radiating to her left arm and jaw. The pain did not change with position or movement. The chest pain was associated with shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and nausea.  Examination:  On physical examination  Mrs. Adams appeared to be distressed and fatigued. She was perspiring and slightly cyanotic. Her blood pressure was elevated at 170/95 mm Hg and her pulse rate was rapid at 114/minute.  This case revolves around the suspected diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress cardiomyopathy or """"broken heart"""" syndrome. The associated stress event  coupled with the acute presentation of chest pain and dyspnea in the absence of significant coronary artery disease  sets the stage for consideration of this diagnosis. Further diagnostic testing  including ECG  troponin levels  and echocardiogram or cardiac MRI would be logical next steps to confirm the diagnosis and initiate treatment."
15,10,29,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial29,Patient Information: Mrs. Jane Smith  72-year-old Caucasian female  Presenting Compliant: Mrs. Smith came to the ER with severe chest pain and difficulty in breathing. She reported that her symptoms started suddenly while she was attending the funeral of her husband earlier in the day.  Past Medical History: Patient history reveals she is a non-smoker with well-managed hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She denies any personal or family history of heart diseases. Her husband died of lung cancer a week ago and she has been under severe emotional stress since then.  Physical Examination: On examination  she appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs showed elevated blood pressure at 169/90 mmHg  and tachycardia with a heart rate of 115 beats per minute. Auscultation revealed slight crackles at the base of both her lungs.  Additional notes: The sudden onset of her symptoms in conjunction with her recent emotional stress indicates a potential diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly referred to as broken heart syndrome. It is a temporary heart condition that is often brought on by stressful situations  such as the death of a loved one. A complete evaluation  including relevant diagnostic tests  should be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis and rule out myocardial infarction which presents similarly. Immediate management and further implication of the diagnosis should be discussed as part of the case study. 
15,10,30,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial30,Patient Profile: Name: Mrs. Evelyn Age: 61 year old Sex: Female Occupation: Retired Schoolteacher Ethnic Origin: Asian-American  Chief Complaints: 1. Difficulty breathing and chest discomfort  2. Profuse sweating 3. Feeling of impending doom 4. Nausea  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension for 7 years  regularly monitored and controlled with antihypertensives. 2. No past history of cardiac ailments. 3. Recently widowed  with significant psychological stress owing to the sudden and unexpected demise of her husband.  Presenting Scenario: Mrs. Evelyn presented to the emergency department following an episode of acute chest discomfort and profuse sweating while at a gathering to commemorate her late husband's life  an event she found particularly distressing.  Exam Findings: On examination  she appeared anxious. Her blood pressure was 170/100 mmHg; pulse 105 beats per minute; respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute  and temperature of 37.2-degree Celsius. Cardiovascular examination indicated mild tachycardia with no added sounds. ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Elevated troponin levels were observed during laboratory investigations  indicating myocardial injury.  This clinical scenario is typical of a suspected case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome). It frequently presents in postmenopausal women following significant emotional stress. The key symptoms such as chest pain and dyspnea mimic myocardial infarction  but it is distinct due to the absence of coronary artery occlusion. The diagnosis will need to be confirmed through an echocardiogram or angiogram to ascertain the characteristic ventricle abnormalities associated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Learning objectives:  1. Recognize Takotsubo cardiomyopathy's clinical presentation  which can mimic myocardial infarction.  2. Differentiate between Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and acute coronary syndrome based on patient history  examination  and investigations.  3. Understand the impact of significant emotional stress in the etiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 4. Develop an appropriate management plan for a patient presenting with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
15,10,31,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial31,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics Patient Name: Ms. Ava Thompson  Age: 68   Sex: Female  Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Past Medical History  She was diagnosed with hypertension and spontaneously resolved depression 5 years ago. She has been under antihypertensive drugs since her diagnosis. There is no history of smoking  alcohol consumption  or drug use. Her mother had a history of ischemic heart disease but no incidence of myocardial infarction. No relevant surgical history is reported. The patient does not have any known allergies.  Presenting Complaints  Ms. Thompson presented to the Emergency Department describing a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. She also reported symptoms of nausea and shortness of breath. There is no history of recent febrile illness or viral infections. The symptoms appeared abruptly following a phone call she received informing her of the sudden death of her beloved younger brother. Prior to that  she was in her usual state of health.  Patient states that this episode reminded her of a similar episode of brief unexplained chest pain that occurred when she heard about her mother's death two years ago  for which she did not seek medical attention.   The main focus of this case is to explore the potential link between emotional stress and the onset of takotsubo cardiomyopathy symptoms  looking at the pathophysiology  diagnosis  management  and long-term care for patients with this condition.
15,10,32,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial32,Patient Case:  Demographics:  This case involves a 68-year-old Caucasian female.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia  controlled with medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively). She is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol in moderation. She has been relatively stable from a cardiac perspective until the present event. The patient also has a history of Generalized Anxiety Disorder  managed with psychotherapy and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). She recently experienced the sudden death of her husband two months ago.  Key Complaints:  The patient presents to the emergency department with the chief complaint of sudden onset of acute chest pain. The pain is severe  localized in the central region of the chest  and radiates up to the neck. The pain is pressure-like  non-radiating  and not related to physical exertion. She also reports associated shortness of breath  nausea  and lightheadedness. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings show ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  mostly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). She denies any palpitations  dizziness  sweating  vomiting or loss of consciousness. Her blood pressure is 145/90mmHg  pulse is 88 bpm  respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute  temperature is 37.0°C  and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air.   This case represents a typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as the broken heart syndrome)  a transient left ventricular dysfunction triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. The condition is more commonly seen in postmenopausal women. The stress causes a change in the heart muscles that results in the left ventricle changing shape. This is often temporary and reversible  but can lead to serious complications such as acute heart failure  arrhythmias  and thromboembolic events. It can sometimes also mimic an acute coronary syndrome. Timely recognition and management of this syndrome is crucial to ensure the patient’s safe recovery.
15,10,33,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial33,Patient Information:   Mrs. Patricia Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian woman  lives alone and recently widowed.  Chief Complaint:   Sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  shortness of breath  and a feeling of impending doom.  Past Medical History:  She has a documented history of controlled hypertension  being treated with Lisinopril 10mg daily. She has no previous history of cardiac problems but does suffer from generalized anxiety disorder managed by a psychiatrist with a stable dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. She is not diabetic or dyslipidemic  doesn't smoke  and drinks alcohol occasionally. She recently lost her husband of 40 years to lung cancer about a month prior to the emergence of these symptoms.  Physical Examination:  Vitals on arrival: BP - 145/90 mmHg  Heart Rate - 112/min  irregular  Respiratory rate - 22/min  SpO2 - 98% on room air Examination conducted indicates no abnormalities in the respiratory system  mild tenderness in the epigastrium  no peripheral edema.  Emergency evaluation suggested Acute Coronary Syndrome. An ECG was conducted  which displayed an ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. Surprisingly  subsequent angiography revealed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A subsequent echocardiogram instead revealed apical ballooning with base-to-apex gradient in left ventricular contraction  suggestive of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.  Diagnosis:   Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy or Broken Heart Syndrome triggered by acute emotional stress following the death of a spouse.

She is post-menopausal and was diagnosed with osteoporosis two years back. She lives alone and has a history of major depressive disorder  for which she has been on sertraline 50mg/day for the past 5 years. She does not smoke or consume alc0hol.  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Thompson presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain radiating to her left arm that started abruptly 6 hours ago while she was at home. The pain was not relieved by rest. Along with this  she experienced shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and nausea. She also experienced intense emotional stress in the last week due to the sudden death of her beloved pet.  Key Points for Discussion/start>: This case provides a key opportunity for discussing the characteristic features of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM)  also known as 'Broken heart syndrome'. TCM commonly presents following a severe emotional stressor (in this case  the death of Mrs. Thompson's pet). Symptoms and signs often mimic a myocardial infarction ('heart attack')  including chest pain and shortness of breath  adding to the diagnostic challenge. It is crucial for students to learn how to distinguish TCM from other life-threatening cardiac diseases based on symptoms  risk factors (such as post-menopausal state in this case)  and appropriate diagnostic tools.  The case discussion can further encompass treating acute presentations  longer-term management strategies  and evaluating the role of psychological stress in cardiac health. The impact of this condition on patient's mental health and lifestyle modification can also be discussed to give the students a holistic understanding of the disease scenario.

She generally enjoys good health  infrequent complaints of mild hypertension  which is controlled with medication  but has no history of coronary disease  diabetes  or any other significant inherited disorder.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient came into the ER complaining of severe  sudden onset chest pain radiating to her left arm. She described the pain as similar to “a heavy weight on my chest."""" She mentions she had been under a lot of stress due to her husband recently being diagnosed with lung cancer.  Evaluation and Physical Examination: Vitals were recorded - BP: 155/95 mmHg  HR: 110 bpm  RR: 20/min  Temp: 98.6 F  Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air. Physical examination revealed that she was paroxysmally sweaty but not in visible distress. Her lungs were clear on auscultation  and her heart sounds were regular without any murmuring.   The ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads (V1-V4)  indicating a possible heart attack. However  upon conducting the blood tests  her Troponin levels were found only moderately raised  not fitting with a typical myocardial infarction profile.  Further Investigation: A coronary angiogram was subsequently ordered and revealed no significant coronary artery disease to account for the ECG changes. Echocardiogram and left ventriculogram showed apical ballooning with hyperkinesis of the basal segment and hypokinesis of the mid and apical segments of the left ventricle - indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   Diagnosis and Conclusion: From the patient's symptoms  the disparity between the ECG changes and Troponin levels  and the results from the coronary angiogram and echocardiogram - a diagnosis of takotsubo or 'stress' cardiomyopathy was made.  Discussion: The case presents an excellent opportunity for medical students to learn about takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition that commonly mimics acute coronary syndrome. Emphasis should be placed on the diagnostic challenges posed by the disease and the importance of considering the emotional/psychological status of the patient  detailed history  examination findings  ECG changes  laboratory values  and results of imaging studies in making the correct diagnosis.

Double mastectomy 8 years prior for stage 2 breast cancer  no recurrence since. Hypertension managed well with antihypertensive medications  free from diabetes  and does not smoke or drink alcohol. Body mass index is 25  with controlled diet and regular mild exercise.  Chief Complaints: She presents with acute onset severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  associated with shortness of breath  palpitations  and lightheadedness. She also reports feeling a heightened sense of stress over the past couple of weeks due to the sudden death of her husband.  Emergency Department Initial Findings: Upon initial assessment  her blood pressure is 168/89 mmHg  heart rate 104 bpm  oxygen saturation 92% on room air  and body temperature 37.1°C. Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads. A bedside echocardiogram reveals apical ballooning of the left ventricle with basilar hypercontractility.  Summary: This case provides a prototypical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome)  which is a transient cardiac syndrome characterized by severe systolic dysfunction of the apical and/or mid segments of the left ventricle. It is usually triggered by intense emotional or physiological stress. Mostly affecting postmenopausal women  the presentation often mimics an acute coronary syndrome  highlighting the importance of differentiation for appropriate treatment and management.
15,10,41,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial41,Patient Demographics: Mrs. A is a 65-year-old Caucasian female of moderate socioeconomic status.  Past Medical History: Mrs. A has a significant past medical history of hypertension and one episode of major depressive disorder. She lost her husband two years ago and lives alone. She does not smoke and occasionally drinks wine. Mrs. A has no known drug allergies  and her medication list includes a daily dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.  Key Complaints: One week ago  Mrs. A experienced a sudden death in the family  her only son. Following this event  Mrs. A started complaining of severe chest pain radiating to her neck  with associated symptoms including shortness of breath  palpitations and nausea. Despite the pain being similar to angina pectoris  she had not experienced such pain before.   She initially ignored her discomfort  attributing it to her grief. However  the persistence and intensification of symptoms over the next couple of days alarmed her  and she decided to visit the emergency department. Mrs. A’s ECG on arrival showed ST segment elevation  raising a high index of suspicion for acute coronary syndrome. However  the symptoms were inconsistent with her patient history as she had no previous episodes of chest pain.  This case presentation suggests a potential episode of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken-heart syndrome)  which must be confirmed with further investigation  such as an echocardiogram and coronary angiography to validate the presumed diagnosis. Though coronary artery disease is also a consideration  it is less likely due to the acute onset and psychosocial trigger. The recent traumatic event experienced by the patient makes takotsubo cardiomyopathy a leading differential diagnosis. This training case provides medical students with the opportunity to explore the link between emotional stress and cardiovascular health  and navigate the diagnostic steps and management of takotsubo cardiomyopathy especially in a bereaved  elderly patient.

This case focuses on recognizing the signs and symptoms of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) under stress-induced conditions corroborated with an older age patient with a relevant medical history. This condition often mimics a heart attack and is exacerbated under severe emotional stress. Consequently  healthcare practitioners should exercise keen observation  coupled with a detailed medical history  to provide a differential diagnosis.    In subsequent discussions or activities  students can be tasked to identify relevant diagnostic tests  potential management protocols  and a comprehensive treatment plan for such a patient. Students should understand the importance of providing holistic care that includes adequate psychological and emotional support for the patient.

She has no known allergies.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with acute chest pain  intermittent in nature  and often related to stress. Pain is described as a tight central chest crushing sensation  radiating towards the left shoulder. Furthermore  she complains of shortness of breath following mild exertion  accompanied by mild fatigue  and lightheadedness. No history of recent trauma  weight loss  night sweats  fever  or cough. Denies smoking or alcohol abuse. No family history of coronary artery disease.   The symptoms were notably triggered following the recent death of her husband  causing significant emotional stress.   These findings  coupled with her age and sex  make Takotsubo cardiomyopathy a key suspect for her condition  as it has been often called the """"broken heart syndrome"""" reflecting its common association with stressful events. She denies any recent similar episodes.   This training case aims to focus on understanding the pathophysiology  diagnosis  and management of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and how it differs from acute coronary syndrome."

She also has a diagnosis of osteoporosis and is post-menopausal. There are no known allergies. She has no previous history of any cardiac disease. She does not smoke  consumes alcohol socially  and lives alone. Her husband passed away 5 years ago  and she has been dealing with late-life depression ever since.   Chief Complaints: Patient presents to the emergency department with acute chest pain that started about 2 hours ago  which she describes as """"sharp"""" and """"stabbing"""" located in the central and left side of the chest  radiating to the left arm along with shortness of breath.   She reports the pain started suddenly whilst she was dealing with a significant emotional distress - a heated argument with her son over the phone. She also feels palpitations  extreme fatigue  and light-headedness. There’s no associated nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis.  She articulates heightened anxiety due to the potential of the pain signifying a myocardial infarction because her late husband had multiple heart attacks. Her immediate self-assumed connection between her symptoms and potential cardiovascular trouble further heightened overall stress.  Additional Notes: She is not on any blood thinners or other significant medications that might complicate a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. A discussion of this potential diagnosis requires presentation of pertinent negatives  such as these  and a thorough examination of her symptoms in light of her recent emotional distress should be undertaken.  Discussions should approach the particularities of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  such as its common triggers  the typical demographic affected (post-menopausal women)  and its usual presentation mimicking acute coronary syndrome. As part of students' differential considerations  they should learn to recognize and diagnose this unique type of stress-induced cardiomyopathy.   This case offers a chance to explore the curious and intricate links between mental health and cardiovascular disease  specifically focusing on the effects that acute emotional stress can have on the heart."

15,10,48,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial48,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Gender: Female Age: 63 Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She has been on: Lisinopril 20mg daily for her hypertension and Atorvastatin 20mg daily for her hyperlipidemia. She also has had histories of severe depression and anxiety for which she is on Zoloft 150mg daily and Alprazolam 0.5mg as needed. She has a 30 pack-year smoking history. No known drug allergies.. She has no family history of cardiac disease  and her parents are both alive and well.   Key Complaints: Patient presented to the emergency department experiencing acute severe chest pain radiating to the left arm  along with shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and nausea. She rated her chest pain as 9/10 on the pain scale. Her symptoms started after she received a call informing her of her daughter's sudden inadvertent serious motor vehicle accident.  Based on her sudden onset of symptoms after severe emotional stress (death of a close family member)  physical examination finding  and further evaluation (which should include ECG changes not typically seen in myocardial infarction  elevated cardiac enzymes  and characteristic left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography) the clinical suspicion for takotsubo cardiomyopathy or the 'broken heart syndrome' should be high.
15,10,49,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial49,Case Report:  Patient Information: Ms. Fernandez  a 68-year-old Hispanic woman who has resided in California for most of her life.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents to the emergency department with acute chest pain and shortness of breath. These symptoms initiated soon after she attended her husband’s funeral. Patient denies any injury or trauma. No chest pain radiation  nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis.  Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertensive heart disease  for which she takes a beta-blocker - Metoprolol. Her late husband was her primary caregiver and managed her medications. She has no history of valvular heart disease  myocardial infarction  cigarette smoking  alcohol  or illicit drug use.  Examinations and Investigations: Her blood pressure upon arrival: 175/95 mmHg  with a heart rate of 110 bpm  and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Physical examination otherwise unremarkable  chest is clear  and no peripheral edemas noted. EKG reveals slight ST-elevation in anterolateral leads (V3-V6). A subsequent echocardiogram shows apical ballooning of the left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction (around 30%)  while her coronary angiogram results appear normal. The subsequent blood test noted a mild elevation of cardiac markers  Troponin-I of 1.8 ng/mL.  Case Discussion: Based on her emotional stress  EKG changes  characteristic echocardiogram findings  and absence of significant coronary artery disease on angiography  Ms. Fernandez was diagnosed with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome).  Education Objective: The purpose of this case is to help medical students understand the etiology  presentation  diagnosis  and treatment of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The condition often mimics myocardial infarction and is triggered by severe emotional stress. She had typical ‘apical ballooning’ of the left ventricle on echocardiography  a finding often associated with this condition. It is crucial to recognize the difference between Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy and acute myocardial infarction as the management is different for both disorders. Quick diagnosis and management can help reduce morbidity and mortality.
15,10,50,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial50,Patient Background:  Ms. Yuko  a 75-year-old Japanese woman  was taken to the emergency room (ER) by her son after experiencing severe chest pains. The patient is a widow  lives with her son  and is a retired schoolteacher. Her son clarified that she had the onset of chest pain after receiving news about her best friend's unexpected death.  Past Medical History:   Ms. Yuko has a history of hypertension which has been well managed with Lisinopril 20mg daily for the past ten years. She also suffers from osteoporosis and has been on Alendronate for 5 years. There is no history of diabetes or high lipid levels. She has no known drug allergies. She quit smoking 15 years ago and her alcohol consumption is negligible. There is no significant family history of early heart disease or sudden death.  Key Complaints:   The key complaints include severe  abrupt chest pain radiating to the left arm  difficulty in breathing  and lightheadedness. The son noticed his mother also seemed fatigued and pale. He also reported that his mother had been under a lot of stress in recent days due to her friend's sudden illness and subsequent demise.  This scenario presents a potential case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as Broken Heart Syndrome. This condition often mimics a heart attack  presents almost identical symptoms  but usually has varied underlying causes that distinguish it from typical myocardial infarctions. In this case  the potent emotional stress could be the trigger for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. However  this is a clinical diagnosis that should be supported with further diagnostic investigations such as EKG  cardiac enzyme levels  and echocardiogram  which will typically reveal apical ballooning and no coronary occlusion that would indicate heart attack.
15,10,51,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial51,"Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information: Ms. Linda Thompson  a 70-year-old Caucasian female  Past Medical History: No history of cardiovascular disease. She has controlled type 2 diabetes and is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption. Family history of myocardial infarction in paternal grandfather.   Presenting Complaints: Ms. Thompson presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her jaw and left arm  lasting for 1 hour. The pain began following a family argument  where she experienced severe emotional stress.   Symptoms: - Severe retrosternal chest pain - Nausea - Dizziness - Shortness of breath - Palpitations  Physical Examination: On physical exam  she is diaphoretic and appears in distress due to severe pain. Vital signs show blood pressure of 155/95  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Heart and lung exams are unremarkable apart from a slight irregularity to the rhythm and bilateral basal crepitations.  Clinical Course: Her ECG reveals ST-segment elevation in the anterior precordial leads  and her troponin level is elevated. She was initially managed as an acute coronary syndrome with aspirin  nitroglycerin  and heparin. However  angiogram did not show any occlusive disease to explain her presentation. Echocardiogram revealed left ventricular apical ballooning with preserved function at the base — a pattern consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""".   Discussion: Patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy often present similarly to those with acute coronary syndrome. it is often associated with emotional or physical stress  which can be a point of conversation in history taking. The critical diagnostic difference is the lack of significant occlusive disease on angiography  coupled with the distinctive finding of apical ballooning on echocardiography. The condition generally has a good prognosis  although supportive care in the acute phase is crucial as complications can arise.   Educational Objectives: - Recognize presentation similarities between takotsubo cardiomyopathy and acute coronary syndrome - Understand the diagnostic significance of the distinctive echocardiographic findings in takotsubo cardiomyopathy - Learn about stress-related etiological factors and discuss them during patient anamnesis - Understand the importance of supportive care in the acute phase and reassure that the prognosis is generally favourable.   This case will provide valuable interactive learning about the presentation  diagnosis  management  and prognosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy."

Her father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 75 and passed away due to subsequent complications. The patient leads a moderately active lifestyle but has been under significant stress due to an ongoing bitter legal dispute over property issues.  Presenting Complaints: The patient reports sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath lasting for about an hour. The chest pain is described as a crushing type  located in the center and radiating to the left arm and the jaw. Patient also reported feeling dizzy and light-headed but denied any fainting spells. She has no previous history of similar instances.  On further inquiry  the patient revealed that she received news of losing her court case just before the symptoms began. She denied any other symptoms like sweating  nausea  vomiting or palpitations. There were no signs of infection like fever  cough or urinary symptoms. No other systemic symptoms like joint pain  rashes or recent weight loss/gain were reported.  This brief summary should give medical students the necessary clinical information to identify the key symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy – chest pain and breathing difficulty  typically after emotional or physical stress. With a hypertensive background and parental history of myocardial infarction  the students should be guided to consider potential heart disease and understand the mimicking nature of cardiomyopathy's signs and symptoms.

She has been feeling nauseous with a mild headache. There were no symptoms suggestive of a cold or flu prior to the onset of chest pain.   Past Medical History:   She reports no history of heart disease  diabetes or hypertension. She has been generally healthy throughout her lifetime apart from occasional migraines.  She’s a lifelong non-smoker and consumes alcohol only socially. She follows a well-balanced diet and has BMI of 23.  Her mother died of a heart attack at the age of 70.  Recent History:  It's reported that Ms. Johnson lost her husband two weeks back causing severe emotional stress. She has been having difficulties sleeping  and expresses feelings of profound sadness and some anxiety since her husband’s death.  Clinical Examination:  On examination  she appears slightly distressed. Vital signs are: BP 170/90 mmHg  Pulse 110 bpm  Temp 98.6 F  Respiratory rate 22 breaths/min. Her oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry is 96% while breathing ambient air. Cardiac auscultation revealed tachycardia with no added sounds or murmurs. Rest of physical examination is normal.  Routine Investigations:  1. Electrocardiogram (ECG): ST segment elevation in precordial leads. 2. Troponin T level: moderately raised 3. Chest X-ray: Normal cardio-thoracic ratio  no signs of pulmonary congestion.  Based on the above findings  acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected  but her young age  history of severe emotional stress and lack of pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors suggest a possibility of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken-heart syndrome). An urgent echocardiogram and coronary angiogram are needed to confirm this.   Learning Objective:  This case is designed to provide medical students an in-depth discussion on takotsubo cardiomyopathy – its triggers  clinical presentation  diagnostic workup  differentiation from ACS  and management.
15,10,54,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial54,Patient Information: Mrs. Y  65-year-old Asian female  retired school teacher.  Past Medical History: Non-smoker and non-alcoholic. Previous episodes of hypertension and mild anxiety for which she was under medication. No history of diabetes or any other chronic illnesses.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Y presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath and mild fainting episodes. This happened a few hours after she received some bad news of her son being severely injured in an accident. The pain was described as ‘crushing’ positioned in the middle of her chest  radiating to her left shoulder and arm. Acute stress-related symptoms were evident when she mentioned about her extreme worry and fear related to her son's condition.  Presentation: The patient appeared anxious  her BP was elevated at 150/90 mmHg with a heart rate of 110 bpm. EKG showed ST-segment elevation in anterior leads  suggesting acute myocardial infarction. The patient was shocked by this given she had a healthy lifestyle with no history of cardiovascular diseases. On probing  she revealed the recent death of her spouse and her son's accident as major stressful life events.  These preliminary details help in giving a clue towards takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome  requiring further exploration and examination through diagnostic tests. Further detailed case study can consist of information regarding cardiac enzyme test results  echocardiogram and cardiac MRI results and the management plan.

She had a recent tragic experience with the sudden death of her husband four weeks ago.  Presenting Complaints: Lillian came to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset severe chest pain which started a few hours prior to her visit. The pain was described as a severe 'crushing' feeling in the center of her chest. Lillian rated it as an 8/10 on the pain scale. She also reported shortness of breath  and feeling unusually tired and light-headed. She denied any radiation of the pain or associated symptoms such as nausea  vomiting  or sweating. There was no history of similar pain in the past.   The sudden tragic incident of her husband's passing and the elevated stress levels due to it made us suspect Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome. ECG  echocardiography  and serum levels of cardiac biomarkers were ordered to confirm the diagnosis and manage it accordingly.

She occasionally suffers from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Her social history is notable for a recent  stressful family incident—passing away of her husband. She leads a reasonably healthy lifestyle  engages in daily walks  and is not known to have either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. She does not smoke nor has a history of excessive alcohol consumption.  Key Complaints: The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute chest pain  which she described as a sudden  sharp  and severe """"crushing"""" sensation in the middle of her chest. The onset of pain was sudden with no history of trauma. Pain worsened with deep breathing and posture change  and was associated with shortness of breath  nausea  and sweating.  Subsequently  the patient also reported recent episodes of intense emotional stress and anxiety over her husband’s passing (acute emotional stressor).  This case report sets the stage for teaching about Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome) a stress-induced heart condition which often mimics symptoms of a heart attack and is typically triggered by intense emotional or physical stress."

Key Complaints:  M.S. presented to the Emergency Department with severe and sudden onset of chest pain radiating to her left arm. She described the sensation as 'heavy' and 'pressing ' somewhat similar to indigestion. The pain began approximately two hours before her arrival at the hospital. The patient also complained of breathlessness and a heightened sense of anxiety.  Film Note:  This sudden severe pain occurred a day after she tragically lost her spouse to cancer. M.S. has been under significant emotional stress coping with her husband's illness and subsequent loss.  This case is a classic presentation for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as Broken Heart Syndrome  which is often triggered by severe emotional stress. The main symptoms are chest pain and shortness of breath  which can mimic acute coronary syndrome. It mainly affects postmenopausal women. In this syndrome  the apex of the left ventricle of the heart balloons and dysfunctions. The exact cause is unknown  but it's thought that a surge of stress hormones stuns the heart  causing changes in heart cells or coronary blood vessels.

She does not suffer from any known chronic illnesses such as diabetes or hypertension. She's non-smoker and leads quite an active lifestyle. Her only contributor to cardiac disease is a family history  as her mother suffers from ischemic heart disease.   Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Watson presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain  similar to a """"heavy weight pressing on the chest""""  that started about an hour ago while she was attending her grandson's birthday party. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath  nausea  and a syncopal episode. The patient admits experiencing an increased level of stress lately  primarily linked to her husband's recent terminal cancer diagnosis.   This case of Mrs. Watson was designed with the aim of demonstrating to medical students the typical scenario of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced or """"broken heart"""" syndrome. It is especially common in post-menopausal women and often triggered by severe stress. The symptoms often mimic those of a heart attack  but it is not due to a blocked artery. Instead  it appears to be a temporary condition where the heart muscle weakens and balloons out  resembling a Japanese octopus fishing pot  or 'takotsubo'.

She is not a diabetic and does not suffer from any other chronic diseases.  Key Complaints: Miss D. presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe crushing chest pain radiating to her left arm. She describes it as """"a heavy weight pressing on her chest."""" She also experienced shortness of breath  palpitations  and profuse sweating. The symptoms started when she was reading through old letters and memorabilia  revisiting emotional memories.   It should be mentioned that she denied having any symptoms prior to this event. She does not have any history of drug abuse and follows a pretty healthy lifestyle.  This brief case report illustrates the primary focused encounter where Miss D.'s presenting symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome  commonly seen in myocardial infarction  could in fact be induced by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  commonly known as """"broken-heart syndrome"""". This condition should be considered as a differential diagnosis in the clinical investigation aiming to rule out myocardial infarction. It’s crucial to understand the patient's psychosocial background and the fact that emotional stress could precipitate Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a rare but significant condition."
15,10,64,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial64,"Patient Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Demographics Report: The patient  a 70-year-old woman  is Caucasian  retired  married  with two adult children. She formerly worked as a primary school teacher and has a moderate level of physical activity since her retirement.  Past Medical History: The patient's history is significant for hypertension for which she is taking a daily medication (Lisinopril). She also had an episode of depression about ten years prior to her current presentation. She denies past history of ischemic heart disease  angina  myocardial infarction  or stroke. There is no history of chronic kidney disease or diabetes. The patient denies any tobacco use and is a moderate drinker (2-3 standard drinks / week). The family history is significant for a brother who had a heart attack at the age of 80.  Key Complaints: The patient was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) with severe chest pain associated with shortness of breath. She reported that her symptoms started suddenly about two hours earlier and have been persistent since then. The pain was described as severe  started while she was resting  and located in the middle of her chest  radiating to her left arm. The symptoms were not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.  Upon further questioning  she reveals that she has been under tremendous emotional stress due to the death of her husband a week ago. There was also associated dizziness but no loss of consciousness. She denied experiencing any bouts of nausea or vomiting  but did complain of a feeling of extreme fatigue.  The patient's EKG results revealed ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads  and echocardiography demonstrated significant left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with apical ballooning  while coronary angiography was negative for significant coronary artery disease  all of which point towards a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Given her presenting symptoms of chest pain associated with significant emotional stress and the loss of a loved one  her physiological findings  and the absence of significant coronary artery disease on angiography  the patient was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  often referred to as """"broken heart syndrome""""."
15,10,65,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial65,Patient Information:   - Gender: Female - Age: 65 years old - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Recently retired teacher  Past Medical History:  - No known cardiac disease - Managed hypertension - Non-smoker - Drinks alcohol minimally  - No known drug allergies - Mother died of a myocardial infarction at age 70  Key Complaints:  The patient presents to the emergency department complaining of a severe chest pain that came on suddenly while she was attending her husband’s funeral. She describes it as a “crushing” sensation  very similar to what is often described in heart attacks.  She also reported shortness of breath  occasional lightheadedness and nausea. Her vitals on arrival were: BP 160/90mmHg  HR 110bpm  RR 18bpm and temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius.   A 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) was done immediately which showed ST segment elevation in the anterior leads  suspicious for anterior wall myocardial infarction. She was given sublingual nitroglycerin without much relief.   Pending any contraindications  aspirin should be administered  and our hypothetical patient should be rapidly moved to a facility capable of cardiac catheterization.   The severity of her symptoms  her recent stressful event  and the ECG changes are all characteristic clues pointing towards a potential diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome.

Past Medical History: A known case of Type-2 Diabetes  controlled by diet and medication. No history of cardiovascular disease  hypertension or hyperlipidemia. Her mother had hypertension and her father passed away from myocardial infarction at an early age.  Key Complaints: Ms. G presented to the emergency room with sudden-onset chest pain  radiating to the left arm  along with shortness of breath. She also reported mild nausea and profound fatigue. Her pain started after she received the news of her brother's sudden demise  with whom she was very close.  On examination  she was anxious  diaphoretic  and her pulse was erratic. Initial EKG pointed towards ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.   This hypothetical case provides a starting point to discuss the condition of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome)  its potential triggers  clinical presentation  and approach towards diagnosis and management. The sudden intense stress leading to chest pain and EKG changes mimicking a heart attack signals towards this condition. Discussion around this case will help medical students to differentiate this condition from other cardiovascular diseases and comprehend the effects of stress on cardiovascular health.

Presenting Complaints:  - Severe chest pain radiating to the back and shortness of breath. - The pain was sudden and severe  unlike anything she’s experienced in the past. - Feels like pressure on her chest along with palpitations. - She rates the pain as 8/10 and describes it as a squeezing sensation in her chest. - Additionally  she also reports feelings of extreme fatigue and episodes of lightheadedness over the past few weeks. - Pre-syncope accompanied by cold clammy skin and a panic attack.  This is a classical case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""")  characterized by the sudden onset of severe chest pain  and left ventricular dysfunction triggered by severe emotional or physical stress. Since the patient's symptoms mimic that of acute coronary syndrome  differentiate the same through diagnostic tests and evaluation.  This case instructs the students to understand the similarities and differences between acute coronary syndrome and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. They need to understand the role of external stressors in inducing cardiovascular illnesses  understand the necessary investigations for diagnosis  and implement effective management strategies. Moreover  they should provide appropriate emotional and psychological support as part of comprehensive patient care. "
15,10,68,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial68,Case Report  Patient Demographics: Patient Initials: SM Age: 61 Sex: Female Occupation: Former School Principal  Race: Caucasian Marital Status: Widowed  1 year ago  Past Medical History: SM has a history of hypertension for the last ten years  which has been under control through medication. She is a diagnosed case of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. She was also diagnosed with depression following the sudden demise of her husband and has been getting treatment for over a year. She abstained from smoking and alcohol consumption.   Key Complaints: SM presented to the emergency room with severe chest pain radiating to her left arm that started abruptly about 2 hours earlier. The pain was constant  constricting in nature  and her severity score was 8 on a scale of 10.  She had also reported experiencing increased episodes of breathlessness over the past week while doing her routine activities and sudden bouts of severe fatigue. She acknowledged feelings of intense anxiety and occasional palpitations for the last 6 months but has been attributing these symptoms to stress and grief over the loss of her spouse.   Upon examination  she appeared pale and anxious  with cold perspiration. ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V6  I  aVL. Her blood pressure was at 160/90 mmHg  and her heart rate was at 105 beats per minute with irregular rhythm.  Clinical Suspicion: Taking into account SM's age  gender  medical history  and presented symptoms  there is a clinical suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress or broken heart syndrome. An echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis and further management treatment will follow.  Notes: This case is designed to train medical students on how to diagnose and manage takotsubo cardiomyopathy  emphasizing the importance of considering this condition in differential diagnosis  especially in postmenopausal women presenting with symptoms mimicking acute coronary syndrome. Subsequent stressors trigger takotsubo syndrome and it should be considered particularly when patients have recently undergone significant emotional stress or loss.
15,10,69,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial69,Patient Information:   Mrs. L  a 63-year-old female  of Asian descent  retired schoolteacher  recently widowed. She is currently living alone.  Past Medical History:   Mrs. L has a history of hyperlipidemia  well-controlled hypothyroidism and does not smoke or drink alcohol. There is no known history of heart disease  hypertension  diabetes mellitus  stroke  or malignancy. She reports being moderately active and maintains a balanced diet.  Chief Complaint:   Having felt well in the morning  Mrs. L visited her husband's grave on the anniversary of his passing. Shortly after returning home  she experienced a sudden onset of severe intense chest pain (like a weight on her chest)  shortness of breath (unable to climb a flight of stairs without panting)  and nausea. She also reported feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The symptoms were not triggered by physical exertion and were not eased by rest or nitroglycerin intake which she had for anginal pain.  The scenario built around the context  should trigger students to explore further the differential diagnosis  including takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome)  understand the pathophysiology  order appropriate investigations like chest X-ray  ECG  blood tests  coronary angiography or echocardiogram and advise apt management strategy. They should be also advised about preventive strategies  and the importance of a comprehensive approach that includes psychological interventions to manage emotional stress.
15,10,70,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial70,Patient Information:   Mrs. Linh  a 72-year-old Vietnamese woman  was brought to the ED by her family. She has a history of hypertension and is otherwise healthy. She does not have a history of cardiac disease. Mrs. Linh is a widow and has been living alone since her husband passed away 2 years ago. She was a teacher now retired and has no known allergies. She denies any tobacco or ilicit drug usage  and only occasionally drinks alcohol socially.  Chief Complaint:  The patient presented with sudden onset chest pain radiating to the left arm. Symptoms started approximately 90 minutes ago. Mrs Linh also complained of mild shortness of breath  but denied any dizziness  nausea or vomiting.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  she appeared anxious and distressed. Vitals were as follows: BP 160/90 mmHg  pulse rate 90 bpm  respiratory rate 22/minute  oxygen saturation of 95% at room air. Cardiovascular examination showed no murmurs  rubs or gallops. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Investigations:  An EKG showed ST elevation in the precordial leads. However  her troponin levels were only mildly elevated. Immediate concern for coronary artery disease determined a cardiac catheterization  which surprisingly revealed no obstructive coronary disease but apical ballooning and hyperkinesis of the heart base.  Diagnosis:  Based on her symptoms  physical exam  and findings on cardiac catheterization  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart Syndrome) was made - a condition often triggered by severe stress  with this case potentially related to her life changes.  Treatment:  The patient was treated with supportive care  including ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers  along with an emphasis on stress management and psychological support.   Course and Prognosis:  Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is generally reversible  but Mrs. Linh’s age and stress levels could result in a longer recovery timeframe. Close and regular cardiology follow-ups along with psychological counseling was planned for her.
15,10,71,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial71,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Name: Mrs. Michelle Rodriguez Age: 68 years old Gender: Female Race: Hispanic Occupation: Retired school teacher Marital Status: Widowed Location: Urban California  Past Medical History: Mrs. Rodriguez has a history of Hypertension and Type II Diabetes  well managed with medications. She is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. She has had no previous cardiac issues. She lost her husband 3 years ago and has faced significant bouts of anxiety and depression since.   Chief Complaints: Michelle was brought to the emergency department last night after she felt a sudden crushing pain in her chest with radiations to her left arm. Along with this  she also reports experiencing dyspnea  nausea  and a brief episode of syncope.  On examination  continued complaints of chest pain. Her diaphoresis and palpitations were observed  but no signs of fever were present. She appeared anxious but was fully oriented in time  place  and person.   This case train aims to highlight key points in identifying and managing takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Key features to focus on for a heightened index of suspicion include: - Older  postmenopausal women with a sudden onset of severe chest pain and dyspnea mimicking myocardial infarction. - A catalyst event causing emotional or physical stress triggering the cardiomyopathy. - A patient presenting with acute chest pain  with ST-segment elevation on ECG  but no coronary artery occlusion found on angiography.  The case further needs to be explored for confirmation of her condition by utilizing cardiac biomarkers (troponin levels)  Electrocardiogram  Echocardiogram  and a Coronary Angiogram. Treatment can include supportive measures and potentially β-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and anticoagulants in certain circumstances. The emotional triggers leading to this condition should also be addressed.  As a facilitator  you should use this case to discuss the differential diagnosis versus acute coronary syndrome  cardiogenic shock  myocarditis  etc.  and the specific diagnostic evaluations for each.
15,10,72,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial72,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Abigail Wilson Age: 61 Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Past Medical History: Mrs. Wilson is a moderately active woman with a history of good health. She has controlled hypertension for which she has been taking Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily  for the past six years. She also has a history of depression for which she uses Sertraline 50mg daily.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Wilson presented to the emergency department with acute onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She mentioned that she has been facing intense emotional stress following the death of her husband two weeks ago. The pain began suddenly while she was at home and does not radiate. Accompanying symptoms included nausea  fatigue  and mild dizziness. The patient denies any prior occurrences of such symptoms.  Emphasize: During this case  the symptoms may resemble those of a heart attack. However  it's crucial to note the significant emotional stress this patient experienced in recent weeks  which is representative of the demographic specifics of those most likely to experience takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition often affects postmenopausal women and is frequently precipitated by severe emotional distress.   Teaching Objective: For medical students to pinpoint takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome)  understand how it differs from myocardial infarction even though they share similar presenting symptoms  to appreciate the role of acute emotional stress in its etiology  and to understand how clinical examinations  EKG  blood tests  echo  and angiogram could help differentiate it from other conditions.

Past Medical History:  Mrs. Thomas is a retired secondary school teacher with a medical history of controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She is currently on metformin and Lisinopril. She is a non-smoker and has a drinking habit of two glasses of wine every evening. Her father died at the age of 70 due to myocardial infarction.   Key Complaints:  Mrs. Thomas presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm which came on suddenly whilst she was attending the funeral of her former colleague. The pain was described as a """"crushing"""" sensation associated with shortness of breath and a sense of impending doom. She also reports that she has been feeling highly stressed and emotionally burdened over the past few weeks due to the sudden death of her close friend. On examining  her blood pressure was 160/90  pulse rate of 100 bpm  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute and her oxygen saturation was 95%. On auscultation  there were no abnormal heart sounds and lungs were clear to auscultation.  This is an example of a typical case of takotsubo (or stress) cardiomyopathy. Often referred to as broken heart syndrome  this condition can mimic the symptoms of a heart attack and is often precipitated by emotional or physical stress events. The exact mechanism remains unknown  but it is believed to be due to a surge in stress hormones stunning the heart  causing changes in the heart muscle cells or coronary blood vessels.   In finalizing this case  the further tests  diagnosis  management  and treatment approaches should be discussed. For instance  an ECG will likely show ST-segment elevation  and a coronary angiogram may show """"apical ballooning"""". Treatment is usually supportive  with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors having a central role."

She is a non-smoker and her alcohol consumption is limited to social situations. Her family history reveals her mother had coronary artery disease. Her recent lipid profiles were within normal limits. She had undergone a hysterectomy at the age of 50 due to uterine fibroids  but there's no other significant past surgical history.   Key Complaints:  Mrs. Thompson was brought into the emergency department (ED) by her daughter. Her daughter reported that she had been witnessing her mother displaying increasing levels of emotional stress as a result of being newly widowed following the recent death of her husband.   The patient complains of sudden-onset chest pain  severe in intensity 7/10  located in the middle of the chest  radiating to the left arm and associated with shortness of breath. She denies palpitations  presyncope or syncope  nausea  or vomiting. She denies feeling any pain between the shoulder blades  discomfort in the neck/jaw/throat  or upper abdomen.  ED vitals on arrival showed blood pressure: 145/90 mmHg  pulse rate: 110/min  respiratory rate: 20/min  and oxygen saturation of 95% in room air.  Physical examination was generally unremarkable  except for tachycardia and a mildly distressing respiratory pattern.   Investigations:  An emergency ECG demonstrates ST elevations in leads V2 to V5. Urgent echocardiography shows apical ballooning of left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction.  On the basis of her clinical presentation  her ECG changes  and echocardiography  a diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken heart syndrome) was made. This condition is often triggered by severe emotional stress  like the grief and emotional pressure that Mrs. Thompson has been experiencing following the death of her husband.   Please note that key findings like ST elevations in ECG and apical ballooning of the left ventricle should lead you to consider Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy among differential diagnoses  particularly when the patient has been subjected to significant emotional stress  as in Mrs. Thompson's case. You should also remember that although Mrs. Thompson complained of chest pain  not all patients with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy would present with this symptom.

History of Present Illness:  The patient presents herself in the Emergency Department with sudden onset of severe chest pain which she describes as a """"heavy feeling""""  radiating to her neck and shoulders. The pain started a couple of hours ago while she was attending her husband's funeral service. She also reports feeling lightheaded and short of breath with a profuse perspiration. She denies any nausea  vomiting  or palpitations.  The patient denies having had similar symptoms before. She does not have a history of coronary artery disease  diabetes  hypertension  or hyperlipidemia. She has had yearly cardiovascular evaluations which have been normal so far. Her last mammogram and pap smear were done a year ago  which were reported as normal.  She does not have any known drug allergies. Her family history is significant for her father having had a heart attack at age 68  and her mother died from stroke at age 71.  Physical Examination:  The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. Her blood pressure is 165/90 mmHg  pulse rate is 110 per minute  respiratory rate is 22 per minute  and body temperature is 36.6°C. Chest examination reveals no abnormalities. Cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. The rest of the exam is essentially normal.  Summary:  This case focuses on a 65-year-old woman who presented with severe chest pain  shortness of breath  lightheadedness  and profuse perspiration during a stressful event. There is a suspicion of takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced or broken-heart syndrome  which often mimics symptoms of a heart attack and is triggered by intense physical or emotional stress. Although it's most often seen in older women  it can affect both men and women of any age. The absence of significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease and the acute emotional stressor could be leading towards this diagnosis. Further investigations (like ECG  blood tests  echocardiogram  or coronary angiography) would be required to confirm this diagnosis."
15,10,83,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial83,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female  Mrs. A  who is a retired school teacher. She is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol. She lives alone and has two adult children who stay nearby. She is physically active with regular walks in the park and participates in a book club.  Past Medical History: Mrs. A suffers from well-controlled mild hypertension and has been on Amlodipine 5mg/day for the past five years. Except for occasional migraines  her health has been quite stable. She had a total knee replacement on her left side 10 years ago. She reports having frequent episodes of stress due to her husband's death from lung cancer two years ago. She has no known allergies  and there is no family history of any serious cardiovascular disease.  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. A was brought to the emergency department experiencing severe chest pain at rest  which began suddenly while she was reading. The chest pain is described as a crushing type in her central chest  radiating to her left arm along with profuse sweating. She says it began two hours ago and has been unrelieved since. Mrs. A also mentions she has been feeling unusually stressed over the past week due to the anniversary of her husband's death approaching. She denied any shortness of breath  dizziness  palpitations  or any other associated symptoms. She hasn't experienced any similar pattern of chest pain before.  This scenario sets the stage to continue with a focussed history-taking  performing a relevant examination  ordering necessary investigations  and starting the appropriate therapy envisaging takotsubo cardiomyopathy given the strong emotional stress trigger  her demographic (post-menopausal woman)  and the sudden onset  the severity of the crushing type of chest pain.
15,10,84,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial84,Patient Case:   Name: Mrs. Hanna Evans  Demographics: 71-year-old Caucasian female  Past Medical History:   1. No cardiac history 2. Controlled hypertension 3. Non-smoker 4. No history of drug or alcohol abuse 5. No familial history of cardiac disease 6. History of Major Depressive Disorder   Key Complaints:   Mrs. Evans was brought into the Emergency Department accompanied by her daughter following significant exertional dyspnea and acute chest pain resembling angina pectoris. The chest pain was described as a sudden onset  severe  central heavy feeling that did not radiate. The symptoms started shortly after receiving the unexpected and distressing news about the death of a close friend.  Additional Information:  Mrs. Evans leads an active lifestyle  regularly having walks in the park and doing yoga classes. She reports no prior incidents of similar pain or discomfort. She had mild flu-like symptoms a week back but has fully recovered since. She manages her hypertension with medication and has complied well with her medication regimen. She was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder 15 years ago and takes anti-depressants regularly. Her daughter mentioned that her mom has been more depressed than usual due to the ongoing pandemic causing isolation.   By choosing this scenario  it allows for students to consider the implications of older age  sudden emotional stress  controlled hypertension  and a history of Major Depressive Disorder in the context of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. They can discuss the importance of patient history  physical exam  and appropriate diagnostic testing in reaching the appropriate diagnosis. It will also enable discussion on differentiating this condition from acute coronary syndromes and appropriate management strategies.
15,10,85,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial85,Patient Information: A 63-year-old Caucasian female of moderate socio-economic status.  Presenting Complaints: The patient came in complaining of sharp  severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and feelings of restlessness.  Past Medical History: The patient was in her usual state of health until 2 days ago. She does not have a significant past medical history. She has no history of any chronic illnesses or any long-term medication. The patient has no known drug allergies. She does not smoke or use recreational drugs but occasionally consumes alcohol.  A significant emotional stress event: The patient’s husband died suddenly from an accident a week ago. She has been under severe emotional stress since the event.  Observation and Vitals: The patient was moderately built and nourished  conscious  and cooperative. Temperature: 98.7°F  Heart rate: 102 bpm  Respiratory rate: 24/min  Blood pressure: 148/95 mm Hg  Oxygen saturation: 94% at room air.  Possible Diagnosis: Based on the symptoms  patient history  emotional stress event  and preliminary examination  the patient may be suffering from Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome. Further diagnostic testing (e.g.  ECG  Echo  cardiac enzymes) will be done to confirm.
15,10,86,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial86,Case Study: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female named Mary. She is a widow who lives alone and recently relocated to the city to be closer to her only daughter following her husband's death.  Past Medical History: Mary has a history of hypertension  which is controlled with medications  and apart from that  she generally enjoys good health. Mary is a non-smoker  rarely drinks alcohol  and leads an active social life. She had an appendectomy when she was 26 years old  but other than that  her surgical history is unremarkable. Her husband died of a heart attack a year ago.   Key Complaints: Mary came into the emergency room complaining of sudden severe chest pain that started soon after hearing the disturbing news about her grandson's car accident. She describes the pain as intense and crushing  which she's never experienced before. It radiated to her left arm and was associated with shortness of breath and excessive sweating. Mary denies any recent chest infections  respiratory disorders  chronic cough  or significant weight loss. Interestingly  she has no history of the classic risk factors for ischemic heart diseases except for controlled hypertension.  For this case  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (or broken heart syndrome) should be considered as an important differential in patients presenting with chest pain  especially in postmenopausal women with recent significant emotional stress. Management can be challenging in such cases  and the training should focus on the identification  diagnosis  and treatment of this unique heart disorder  as well as teaching students the difference from other more common causes of chest pain.  Please note: this case assumes a setup where the emotionally triggering event (her grandson's car accident) happened a few hours before the onset of symptoms. This assumption highlights the temporal relationship between the stressful incidents and the onset of the symptoms of broken heart syndrome  an important diagnostic criteria for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
15,10,87,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial87,"Subject: Training Case: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Information: Name: Mrs. Ella Patterson Age: 68 years Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian  Past Medical History: Mrs. Patterson has a history of hypertension and Type II diabetes mellitus that is managed well through medication and dietary changes. She has a family history of cardiovascular diseases as her father died from myocardial infarction at age 75. She does not smoke or consume alcohol and tries to maintain an active lifestyle despite a sedentary job.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Patterson was brought to the emergency department following a stressful ordeal at home - her house was burgled while she was inside. Though not harmed physically  she suffered an episode of severe chest pain mimicking a heart attack not long after the incident took place.  On presentation  she describes her pain as """"sudden and crushing """" akin to a heavy weight crushing her chest. The pain radiates to the left arm and she complains of shortness of breath and light-headedness. She also reports feeling nauseous and anxious and has broken out in a cold sweat.  In conclusion  the aim of this case report is to help medical students understand the relationship between intense emotional stress and some cardiac events  specifically takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This case can be used to reinforce the learning of diagnosis and management of takotsubo cardiomyopathy based on the presenting symptoms and history of the patient."
15,10,88,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial88,"Patient Demographics:  Ms. A is a 68-year-old Japanese woman with a history of hypertension and no documented history of coronary artery disease. She is a retired mathematics high school teacher currently residing in rural Japan  having migrated from a busy city after her husband passed away 5 years ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohol and maintains a diet of traditional Japanese cuisine. She lives alone and has a network of close neighbors who regularly check on her following her recent bereavement.   Chief Complaint: Ms. A presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain that started a couple of hours ago  which she describes as “a sudden heavy  squeezing pain in the center of her chest."""" The pain was associated with shortness of breath. No precipitating events were noted apart from her mentioning having an argument with someone at the local market.  Past Medical History: Ms. A has been hypertensive for ten years  controlled on medication. She has no previous episodes of chest pain  no history of heart failure  or any major hospitalizations. There is no family history of significant cardiovascular disease. She was recently widowed  and has been struggling with chronic stress  grieving  and depression. She has been under treatment for anxiety symptoms for the past 2 years  but she has no known psychiatric illnesses.   Her healthcare maintenance includes annual influenza vaccination and biannual routine physical checkups. The patient is compliant with her medication for hypertension and anxiety. She has never smoked or consumed alcohol in her life.   Physical Findings: On examination  she appeared sweaty and distressed. Her blood pressure was slightly elevated  and her heart rate appeared tachycardic. She was afebrile; her other vital signs were within normal limits. The cardiopulmonary exam revealed slight tachycardia without any murmurs or added sounds. Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.   Differential Diagnoses: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  Acute coronary syndrome  Anxiety disorder  Pulmonary embolism.   Clinical Course: The chest pain and shortness of breath that Ms. A experienced are highly suggestive of cardiac etiology. Her electrocardiogram and cardiac enzyme levels showed changes consistent with myocardial injury. However  a coronary angiography showed no obstructive coronary artery disease. Echocardiography depicted apical ballooning with a hyperdynamic base  also known as ‘octopus pot' appearance  strongly suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  Treatment: Ms. A was managed conservatively with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and diuretics as required. She was admitted to the hospital for monitoring and supportive treatment. Fortunately  her symptoms resolved over the following week. In addition to pharmacological treatments  psychological support was added and arranged for a bereavement support group to help her cope with her emotional stress.  Conclusion: This case highlights the diagnosis and management of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  a condition often overlooked as it mimics myocardial infarction. It is crucial for clinicians to be aware of this condition as it is typically precipitated by emotional stress  especially in postmenopausal women. It is typically manageable with conservative treatment and is usually resolved between days to weeks. "
15,10,89,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial89,Patient Identity: Mrs. Rosa Cantu  Age: 65 years old  Sex: Female  Occupation: Retired Elementary School Teacher  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Cantu has been generally healthy with no significant past medical history until presented with symptoms related to the cardiovascular system. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She has a body mass index of 24.7 kg/m2. She  however  admits to having considerable levels of stress due to financial and family issues. There is no family history of cardiovascular diseases  diabetes  or early death.  Presenting Complaints:  Mrs. Cantu is presented in the ER complaining of acute chest pain radiating to the jaw and the left arm. The pain begun spontaneously while she was at home  described as severe  squeezing  and similar to a heavy weight placed on her chest. Accompanying symptoms include profuse sweating  shortness of breath  extreme fatigue  and nausea. She states that her symptoms started following a heated argument with her son.   Next Steps: The medical students will use this case to further explore managing a patient with suspected Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  also known as broken heart syndrome. They would evaluate additional cardiovascular signs through lab tests  electrocardiogram  cardiac imaging techniques and formulate a differential diagnosis  considering other potential causes for acute chest pain like myocardial infarction. The students would also delve into an understanding of the interaction between severe emotional stressors and the manifestation of physical symptoms.
15,10,90,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial90,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics:   Patient Initials: A.B.   Age: 65 years old    Gender: Female   Race: Caucasian   Occupation: Retired school teacher   Insurance Status: Medicare    Past Medical History:  1. Controlled hypertension on treatment for the past 10 years. 2. Mild neuropsychiatric issues  specifically anxiety.   Presenter’s Concerns:   A.B. was generally fit and well with controlled hypertension for which she is medicated (patient on a usual dose of beta blocker and ACE inhibitor for it). Being a retired school teacher  she leads a very organized and calm lifestyle. In previous routine check-ups no significant abnormalities were noted. Apart from hypertension  she has no family history of cardiovascular diseases but has been dealing with anxiety.  She presented at the emergency department with acute onset chest pain  continuous and severe in nature  not relieved with rest or sublingual nitroglycerin. The pain was sudden after an intense argument with her neighbor which had caused her significant distress.  Her vitals were stable other than a slightly elevated blood pressure. A.B. denied any other symptoms like shortness of breath  nausea  vomiting  diaphoresis  or syncope.  Key Complaints:  1. Sudden onset severe chest pain 2. Unrelieved with rest or sublingual nitroglycerin. 3. Psychological distress due to an intense argument.  This case should further include clinical examination findings  investigations (including cardiac marker levels  EKG  echo  cardiac catheterization)  and the eventual diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. The history of psychological stress  symptoms of chest pain and the absence of major risk factors for conventional heart diseases would guide the students toward the diagnosis.
15,10,91,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial91,Patient Case: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Demographics  Patient: Mrs. Patricia Hudson Age: 67 years old Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher  Past Medical History  The patient's past medical history includes hypertension (controlled with medication) and stage II breast cancer  for which she had completed chemotherapy and radiation approximately 5 months prior. She also has a history of generalized anxiety disorder. No previous record of cardiac diseases.  Key Complaints  Mrs. Hudson was rushed to the emergency room due to sudden onset shortness of breath and severe chest pain. She reported the pain as crushing and radiating to her left arm. The pain precipitated while she was at a family event  a few moments after she had received the news of her brother's sudden death. She has no history of chest pain or similar symptoms in the past.  The patient reports a significant amount of emotional stress recently due to the passing away of her brother  in addition to minor symptoms such as tachycardia and episodic faintness over the past few weeks. She denies any recreational drug use or recent increase in alcohol consumption  and denies any recent chest trauma or severe physical exhaustion as well.  Observations on arrival indicate the patient is in mild distress  diaphoretic  and pale. Her vitals reveal tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. EKG shows ST-segment elevation; however  subsequent angiography doesn't show any significant blockages to justify these changes. Lab tests reveal a slight elevation in cardiac enzymes. An echocardiogram shows apical ballooning and reduced ejection fraction indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The distribution of wall motion abnormalities in the patient's ventricle doesn't correlate with a single epicardial coronary artery supplying area  further supporting the diagnosis.  Overall  the presentation and the stress-inducing event she had experienced recently aligns with the diagnosis of takotsubo or stress cardiomyopathy.
15,10,92,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial92,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  Patient Demographics: Female  62 years old  Caucasian; retired English teacher; weight 155 pounds; height 5 feet 6 inches; lives alone; non-smoker  occasional alcohol use; lives a moderately sedentary lifestyle.  Past Medical History: Known Hypertension for 10 years [controlled with medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily)]; no history of diabetes or any other cardiovascular diseases. No surgical history  no allergies known. She takes a multivitamin and calcium supplement daily. Mental health history includes generalized anxiety disorder managed with cognitive behavioral therapy and paroxetine. No family history of heart disease.  Clinical Presentation: Presenting with severe chest pain described as a sudden 'tightness'  started an hour ago at rest while she was watching the news about a tragic incident. Also experiencing shortness of breath  cold sweats  and feelings of impending doom. She describes the pain as being similar to a 'heart attack' she has seen on TV  rating the pain as 8/10. No radiation of pain. She denies nausea  vomiting  palpitations  blurring of vision  or loss of consciousness. There is no correlation of the pain with physical activity and it does not improve with rest.  Physical Examination: Patient appears anxious and distressed. Vital signs: BP 160/90 mmHg  HR 110 bpm  RR 20/min  Temp. 98.6F  Oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Cardiac exam revealed tachycardia  no murmurs. Rest of physical examination is within normal limits.   Impression: Given the patient's symptoms and history  one of the differential diagnoses would be Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy  due to the sudden onset of severe chest pain following emotional stress. Additional testing would include an EKG  cardiac biomarkers  chest x-ray  and potentially  an echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization to confirm the diagnosis and rule out an actual myocardial infarction.  Discussion Points: 1. Pathophysiology and precipitating factors of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 2. The clinical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and importantly  how it mimics myocardial infarction. 3. Importance of timely investigation and management. 4. Appropriate use of pharmacological management in managing the condition. 5. The role of stress and mental health in the onset of this condition.
15,10,93,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial93,"Case Report:   Patient Information: Mrs. G.M.  a 65-year-old Caucasian woman.  Occupation: Recently retired school teacher.  Living situation: Lives alone  recently widowed. She has two grown-up children who live out state.  Past Medical History:  1) Chronic hypertension well controlled with medication (Lisinopril  5mg to be taken orally every day) 2) Anxiety disorder diagnosed five years ago  managed with a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and medication (Escitalopram  10mg to be taken orally every day). 3) No history of cardiac disorders. She has never smoked and drinks alcohol occasionally.  Current Presentation/Admission:  She presented to the emergency room of the local hospital with sudden onset of severe chest pain  similar to what she heard is experienced in a heart attack. The onset of pain was while she was attending her husband's funeral.  Key Complaints:  Severe chest pain  anxiety  shortness of breath  palpitations  and feeling of impending doom.   Emergency room doctor requested an Electrocardiogram (ECG)  which showed ST-segment elevation  which is typically seen in patients experiencing a myocardial infarction (heart attack). However  her cardiac biomarkers (Troponin levels) were only mildly elevated which didn’t correlate with the degree of ECG changes.   Subsequent emergency coronary angiography showed no significant blockages  ruling out acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction.   The left ventriculogram showed the classic 'octopus pot' sign of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy - with apical ballooning and contraction of the base of the heart.   The provisional diagnosis:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""".   Background for Medical Students:  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can mimic symptoms of a heart attack  and it commonly occurs in postmenopausal women experiencing intense emotional or physical stress. It is key to differentiate it from acute coronary syndrome for appropriate management. The prognosis is generally good if managed properly."
15,10,94,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial94,"Case Report:   Patient Demographics: Name: Mrs. Johansson Age: 68  Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired primary school teacher  Past Medical History: Mrs. Johansson has a history of hypertension which has been relatively well-controlled with medication (amlodipine 5mg daily). She is moderately overweight (BMI 28.4)  non-smoker  and does not consume alcohol frequently. She does not have any known history of coronary heart disease or any other cardiovascular diseases. She was recently widowed and has been undergoing immense emotional stress following the sudden death of her husband.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Johansson presented to the emergency department with severe chest discomfort accompanied by shortness of breath. She described the pain as a heavy pressing sensation radiating to her arm. She also stated that the pain was similar to that of a previous bout of angina experienced two years ago.   Other associated complaints were generalized weakness  increased anxiety  and transient loss of consciousness. She also reported experiencing emotional distress since recent past due to the loss of her spouse. No history of trauma  fever  cough or other symptoms was noted.  This case is essential for undergraduate and postgraduate medical students as it provides an overview of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as """"broken heart syndrome"""") which usually occurs after experiencing severe stress. The affliction is characterized by the sudden temporary weakening of the heart muscles causing the left ventricle to change shape. The scenario will help students understand the importance of taking a comprehensive medical history  including psychological stressors  in forming a differential diagnosis for acute chest pain."
15,10,95,diagnosis15-prompt10-trial95,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Ms. Emma Walker is a 65-year-old Caucasian female. She is a retired elementary school teacher and resides in a suburban community with her husband. She is a non-smoker and occasionally has a glass of wine during social occasions.  Past Medical History:  Ms. Walker has a history of well-controlled hypertension and is currently on medication (hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily). She was diagnosed with anxiety after her retirement five years ago and is on low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). She gets yearly checkups and her last routine check-up six months ago reported good health.  Key Complaints: Ms. Walker has presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. The pain started while she was attending her grandchild's birthday party. She describes the pain as a pressure-like feeling  rated 8 on a scale of 10. Along with this  she also reports associated symptoms of shortness of breath  light-headedness  and excessive sweating. She denies the history of similar complaint  trauma  or acute illness. She mentions feeling overwhelmed by the anxiety of hosting the party and managing the children. Her blood pressure upon admission was 150/90 mmHg.  Relevant information: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy  or Broken Heart Syndrome  is often triggered by severe stress. The patient's symptoms are very similar to a heart attack. Elderly women post-menopause are typically more susceptible to this condition  particularly if they have a history of a neurological condition or mental health disorders  such as anxiety.

Key Complaints: Linda arrived at the emergency department with sudden onset  severe chest pain which radiates to her back and left arm. The pain started few hours ago  roughly an hour after receiving the news of her only son's sudden death in a car accident. She describes the pain as a squeezing sensation and rated it as 7 out of 10 on the pain scale. Accompanying symptoms include excessive sweating  dyspnea  and a sense of impending doom. She denies any episodes of loss of consciousness  nausea  or vomiting. She has never experienced a similar kind of pain before.  In the examination  she appears distressed. Vitals are BP: 155/95mmHg  Pulse: 105 BPM  Respiratory rate: 22/minute  Oxygen saturation: 96% on room air and temperature: 37.0C. Auscultation of the chest showed no added sounds or murmurs. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.  The key learning objective of the case is to teach students how to identify  diagnose  manage a patient with takotsubo cardiomyopathy  by taking into consideration her emotional stressor and presenting symptoms. The case encourages students to differentiate takotsubo cardiomyopathy from other causes of acute chest pain and understand the role of echocardiography  ECG changes in diagnosis. They also learn to manage acute symptoms and recognize the long-term psychological treatment for such patients.  This case will provide an excellent opportunity for students to learn how emotional factors can potentially trigger a cardiac event and to develop a comprehensive patient management approach that appreciates the complex interplay between psychology and physiology.

The patient does not have a history of smoking  diabetes  illegal drug use  or alcoholism. She reports her mother died of myocardial infarction at the age of 72 but otherwise  no significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. She recalls a significant stressful event in her life  the death of her spouse  a month ago.  Chief Complaints  The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain radiating to her back  accompanied by dyspnea and palpitations. The symptoms started abruptly while she was preparing to visit her husband's grave  which  as per her interpretation  was an activity associated with severe emotional distress. The pain was alleviated partially by a nitroglycerin tablet. She denied any associated symptoms like nausea  vomiting  or diaphoresis. The symptoms have caused her considerable anxiety as she is worried about having a heart attack.   This case report gives a classic presentation for takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as """"broken-heart syndrome"""")  which typically occurs in postmenopausal women  often in response to a severe stressor. It can present similarly to acute coronary syndrome  and differentiating the two is essential as the management strategies differ significantly.   The case should further include a discussion of appropriate diagnostic criteria (including EKG findings  serum cardiac markers  and echocardiographic findings) as well as recommended management strategies and potential future patient complications. This case thus offers important learning points about the impact of emotional stress on cardiac health and serves as a comprehensive training tool in understanding the differential diagnosis of chest pain."

Family history reveals her grandmother suffered from coronary artery disease. She is a non-smoker  drinks alcohol socially and occasionally  and does not use recreational drugs. She is compliant with her anti-hypertensive medication but currently isn't on any other regular medication.  Presenting Complaints: Ms. Smith was brought to the emergency department with severe  sudden onset chest pain. She described the pain as a heavy pressure sensation occurring while watching news coverage of a highly stressful event earlier in the day. The pain radiated to her left jaw and was associated with shortness of breath  nausea  and light-headedness. The patient denies any similar episodes in the past. During her stay in the emergency room  she experienced an episode of palpitation but remained alert and oriented throughout.   Note: The case report is primarily designed for takotsubo cardiomyopathy also known as stress cardiomyopathy  which is triggered by severe emotional stress events. It is common amongst post-menopausal women and presents similar to a heart attack but involves no actual heart disease and calls for a different management strategy.

She is post-menopausal and has no known allergies. No history of smoking or substance abuse. Her family history includes her father who passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 65.  Presenting Complaint: The patient arrived at the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain radiating to the left side of her neck and arm. Described the pain as """"central chest crushing """" resembling her “usual” panic attacks  but significantly more severe than she has previously experienced. Other associated symptoms include dyspnea  profuse sweating  nausea and mild lightheadedness. She denies experiencing any recent trauma or injury  but mentions the recent sudden death of her brother two days prior that has caused her extreme emotional distress.  Clinical findings: Physical Examination was significant for a blood pressure of 155/90 mm Hg  heart rate was rapid and irregular at 120 beats/min  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. On auscultation  there were normal heart sounds with no murmurs and lung fields were clear. EKG showed signs of ST-segment elevation in anterior leads.   Further diagnostic tests were ordered including complete blood count  troponin levels  lipid profile  and a transthoracic echocardiogram. Laboratory results revealed elevated troponin levels and lipid panel within normal limits. Echocardiogram displayed a reduced ejection fraction (40%) and apical ballooning of the left ventricle with hyperkinesia of the base  indicative of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.   These findings in the absence of any or severe obstructive coronary artery disease confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient was managed with supportive care including aspirin  beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors  and anxiolytic agents.   Key Learning Point: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  also known as """"broken-heart syndrome""""  often presents like an acute myocardial infarction. It may be triggered by physical or emotional stress and is more common in postmenopausal women. It is crucial to recognize this condition as its management varies from that of other forms of cardiomyopathy."
