9,1,1,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial1,Subject: Patient Presentation - Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: This is a case presentation of Mr. John Doe  a 60-year-old Caucasian man who has presented with symptoms suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism.   History of Present Illness: Mr. Doe reported sudden onset of sharp  stabbing chest pain this morning that worsens upon deep inhalation. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath  coughing  sweating  and bluish coloration of the skin and lips. He also mentioned having been experiencing periods of lightheadedness and palpitations for the past week.   Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia which are well-controlled with medication. He is a current smoker with a 30-pack year history. He also had an open reduction and internal fixation for a right hip fracture six weeks ago after a fall at his construction job. Postoperatively  he had a significant period of immobility due to pain and was partially non-compliant with physiotherapy. He denied history of any similar episodes in the past. He has no known drug allergies.  Current Medications: 1. Lisinopril 20 mg once daily for hypertension 2. Atorvastatin 40 mg at bedtime for hyperlipidemia   Family History: Mr. Doe's father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 75. His mother has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus but no history of blood clots or genetic diseases.  These symptoms combined with his recent major surgery and extended immobilization  his smoking history  and positive family history of cardiovascular disease place Mr. Doe at a high risk of having an Acute Pulmonary Embolism. Immediate steps will be taken to confirm diagnosis and start appropriate management.
9,1,2,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial2,"Title: Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 65-year-old Female Patient  I. Demographic Information  Patient Name: Ms. Susan Thompson Age: 65 Sex: Female DOB: February 2  1956 Race: Caucasian Marital Status: Widow Occupation: Retired Teacher  II. Chief Complaint  The patient presents to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain that has been worsening over the past several hours. She describes the pain as a """"sharp  stabbing"""" pain that increases with deep inhalation.  III. Relevant Medical History   Ms. Thompson has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which is controlled with daily use of Lisinopril. In addition  she has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 5 years ago  for which she was treated with warfarin for 6 months. She has been off anticoagulant therapy since then. She is also a former smoker with a 20 pack-year smoking history but quit smoking after her DVT diagnosis.  IV. Recent Activity and Lifestyle  Ms. Thompson is recently post-operative from a total hip replacement surgery two weeks ago. She has been immobile at home during her recovery  doing minimal physical activity. She lives alone and is relatively sedentary even before her hip surgery. With the death of her husband 6 months ago  she reports periods of stress and anxiety.  V. Likely Diagnosis   The combination of her recent surgery  previous DVT  history of smoking  limited mobility  and her current symptoms (chest pain and acute onset of shortness of breath) points to a strong possibility of an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Further diagnostic tests such as D-dimer  CT Pulmonary Angiogram  or V/Q scan should be pursued to confirm the diagnosis.  VI. Risk Factors  Risk factors in this patient include older age  personal history of DVT  recent orthopedic surgery  prolonged immobility  and history of smoking. While hypertension is not a direct risk factor for PE  it does contribute to overall cardiovascular risk.  VII. Conclusion  Management strategy will depend on confirmation of diagnosis and assessment of the severity of her disease. In the meantime  anticoagulant therapy should be initiated to prevent further clot formation and propagation. Patient education on lifestyle modifications  physical activities suitable for her condition  and the importance of medication adherence will further contribute to her long-term management."
9,1,3,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial3,Patient Presentation:  I am discussing Mr. James Johnson  a 65-year-old African American male who presents to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath  increased heart rate  sweating  and pain in the chest area  notably worse when taking deep breaths. Symptoms began approximately 6 hours ago and have progressively worsened.   He lives in Washington  D.C.  with his wife  and before retirement  he worked for a construction company. Mr. Johnson is a former smoker  with a 20-pack year history. He quit smoking ten years ago.  Our patient has a significant medical history of hyperlipidemia  hypertension  and type-2 diabetes  for which he takes Metformin  Lipitor  Metoprolol  and Aspirin daily. He had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his left lower extremity about five years ago  which was successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy  but unfortunately didn't comply with the recommended lifestyle changes.  Family history includes his father  who died of myocardial infarction at an early age  and his mother  who is alive and well.  He denies any recent long-distance travel  trauma  surgeries  or significant change in activity level. His pain scores 7 on a 10-point scale. His body mass index (BMI) is 31  indicating obesity  which may have contributed to the thrombus formation.   On physical examination  he appears anxious. Vital signs measurements are as follows: Blood pressure is 155/95 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation 89% on room air. Auscultation reveals tachycardia and decreased breath sounds at the right lung base. Lower limb examination reveals no signs of deep vein thrombosis.  Given his previous history of DVT  current presentation  and risk factors  there is a high suspicion of an acute pulmonary embolism. We will admit Mr. Johnson to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment as necessary.
9,1,4,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial4,Patient Presentation  Good day  everyone. I would like to introduce a patient with acute pulmonary embolism admitted to our department recently. The patient is a 63-year old Caucasian male named Mr. John Bryce. His BMI is 27  putting him slightly in the overweight range.   Mr. Bryce presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  and feelings of anxiety. The symptoms began two days ago  mildly and intermittently but progressively worsened which made him visit the hospital.   His past medical history is significant with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both well-controlled on medication for the last 15 years. He had a deep vein thrombosis following cardiothoracic surgery for a coronary artery bypass graft in 2011. He is a former smoker  quitting in 2007 after a span of 20 years smoking history. Mr. Bryce lives alone and is retired  and his alcohol consumption is within the recommended limits. He has no known drug allergies.  On examination  Mr. Bryce was found to be tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. His resting oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. He appeared anxious but was oriented to time  place  and person.  The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism was confirmed via helical computed tomography (CT) angiography which revealed a clot in the right pulmonary artery. Blood work showed an elevated D-dimer level of 1500 ng/mL (Normal value: ≤ 500 ng/mL) and a mildly elevated troponin level.  Overall  this patient  Mr. Bryce  being at a heightened risk due to past medical history of DVT and recent surgery  presented with classically acute onset of dyspnea and chest pain leading us to suspect acute pulmonary embolism. After a series of diagnostic tests  our suspicions were confirmed.  Later today  the medical team will discuss with Mr. Bryce the treatment options  including anticoagulant therapy and potentially thrombolytic therapy.  I will keep you all updated on his progress and the final treatment decision. Thank you.
9,1,5,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial5,Title: Case Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Introduction: Patient Info: Mr. James Stevens  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented today with complaints consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.  Demographic Info: The patient lives in Seattle with his wife. He is a retired construction worker and has a 40-pack/year history of smoking  which he quit 5 years ago. He does not engage in any regular physical activity  follows a high-fat diet and consumes moderate amounts of alcohol. He has no known drug allergies.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Stevens has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been fairly well-managed with medication (Lisinopril and Metformin  respectively). He was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) three years ago after surgery for a broken femur which he sustained from a fall. He was maintained on Warfarin for DVT but stopped the medication a year ago of his own accord.  Presenting Symptoms: For the past 24 hours  Mr. Stevens has been experiencing increasingly severe shortness of breath  chest pain aggravated by deep inspiration and cough productive of pink-tinged frothy sputum. He also reported episodes of light-headedness  but no loss of consciousness.   In Delving further into his history  he mentioned a recent long drive (8 hours each way) to visit his daughter over the Thanksgiving holiday which could have contributed to prolonged immobility.   Based on his past medical history  current symptoms  and risk factors  an acute pulmonary embolism is highly suspected. The patient has been admitted for urgent further investigation and treatment.   It is crucial to educate the patient about the importance of medication adherence and lifestyle modifications to manage his multiple chronic conditions  and the potential consequences of untreated or sub-optimally treated DVT leading to life-threatening conditions like pulmonary embolism. 
9,1,6,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial6,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian female presenting with symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism. She complains of sudden onset of shortness of breath  harsh coughing and chest pain which seems to worsen with deep breathing. She also states that she experienced an episode of lightheadedness and palpitations earlier in the day.  Demographic Information:  The patient is a retired schoolteacher; she lives alone in an apartment in uptown with her pet dog. She is a non-smoker  rarely drinks alcohol and she maintains an active lifestyle which includes daily walks  and weekly yoga classes. She has a BMI of 24.3 which is within the healthy range.

9,1,7,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial7,"Patient Presentation:  We are discussing Mr. John Doe  a 69-year-old Caucasian male who has presented with symptoms indicative of an acute pulmonary embolism. Mr. Doe currently resides in Austin  Texas with his wife of 40 years. He is a retired police officer and non-smoker. His alcohol intake is minimal and he has no known drug allergies. Mr. Doe does not have a personal or family history of clotting disorders. He is fairly active and tries to maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle.   Regarding his past medical history  he was previously diagnosed with Stage II hypertension and he maintains it with prescription medication  Lisinopril. Also  he underwent a hip replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis two weeks ago. In addition to the hypertension and osteoarthritis  Mr. Doe has a controlled case of type II diabetes  which he manages with the help of metformin.   Today  Mr. Doe has presented in the emergency department with sharp  stabbing chest pain that started out of nowhere when he was gardening at home. He rated it as a severe 10/10 and described the pain as """"worse when taking a deep breath."""" He reports additional symptoms of lightheadedness  rapid heart rate  uneasy feeling  and shortness of breath. Considering his recent surgery and his presenting complaints  we have a high clinical suspicion of an acute pulmonary embolism. Further investigations including D-Dimer Test  imaging studies like CT Pulmonary Angiogram  and possibly an echocardiogram will be carried out to confirm the diagnosis and severity.  In conclusion  considering Mr. Doe's age  recent surgery  and signs and symptoms  pulmonary embolism may be the likely diagnosis. Immediate diagnostic tests will be ordered and he will be prepared for the necessary emergency treatment. As part of our differential diagnosis  we will also consider other conditions such as acute myocardial infarction and pneumothorax. A thorough examination and prompt treatment is crucial to improve the patient’s outcome."
9,1,8,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial8,Title: Case Presentation on Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: Patient's Name: John Doe Age: 55 years Gender: Male Occupation: Bank accountant Race: Caucasian Relative: Wife   Presenting Complaint: Mr. John Doe presented with acute shortness of breath  sharp chest pain exacerbated on inspiration  and palpitations. These symptoms started suddenly two hours prior to admission. John also reported feeling faint and dizzy with episodes of profuse sweating.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) three years ago. He also suffers from hypertension and hyperlipidemia managed by medications at regular intervals. The patient was a smoker for 25 years but quit five years ago. His father had a history of DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE).  Physical Examination: General examination revealed a breathless patient with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/minute. His oxygen saturation was at 90% on room air. He had a pulse of 110 beats per minute and his blood pressure was 155/90 mmHg.   Investigations: A chest X-ray did not reveal any acute abnormality. However  due to clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism and risk factors  a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was ordered.   In terms of blood investigations  a complete blood count  serum electrolytes  liver  and renal function tests were all within normal limits. D-dimer was elevated  further increasing the suspicion of PE.   Conclusion:  Based on the patient's history of DVT  current symptoms  and preliminary test results  this clinical scenario is highly suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism. The results of the CTPA would provide definitive diagnosis. Meanwhile  anticoagulation therapy was initiated to prevent further clot propagation. Should the diagnosis of PE be confirmed  further investigations would be required to identify the source of emboli  and long term anticoagulation therapy will continue to prevent recurrent PE instances.   Next Steps:  Mr. Doe has been admitted for close monitoring and appropriate Stabilisation of his acute condition. Confirmation of PE and further treatment plans will be executed promptly once we have the CTPA and other remaining investigations.
9,1,9,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial9,Patient Presentation:  Introduction: Today  I would like to discuss the case of Mr. John Wilson  a 75-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with symptoms indicative of acute pulmonary embolism (PE).  Background Information: Mr. Wilson is a retired industrial worker  originally from Detroit  Michigan  is a non-smoker  and consumes alcohol occasionally. His BMI is 25.7  suggesting he is slightly overweight.  Past Medical History: In terms of past medical history  Mr. Wilson is a well-controlled hypertensive and has type II diabetes  for which he takes Metformin consistently. He was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) about three years ago  which was treated successfully with warfarin. He also has a significant history of hyperlipidemia. His family history reveals that both his parents died of cardiac diseases.  Presenting Complaints and Findings: Mr. Wilson presented to the ED with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain that worsened upon deep inhalation  and mild cough with scanty hemoptysis for the past few hours. On examination  he had tachycardia and tachypnea. Auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds on the right side. Oxygen saturation was slightly low.   Blood Investigation: Lab investigations showed a slightly increase in his D-dimer levels  and his blood sugar and blood pressure were moderately elevated at the time of the assessment. An ECG showed signs of right ventricular strain with sinus tachycardia.  Conclusion: Considering Mr. Wilson's signs  symptoms  and past medical history of DVT  a likely diagnosis is acute pulmonary embolism. Further investigation with a CT pulmonary angiogram would be valuable for confirmation. Immediate administration of heparin should be considered for anticoagulation  and subsequent transition to long-term oral anticoagulation would be suggested  given his high risk due to his age  hypertension  diabetes  and history of DVT.
9,1,10,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial10,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male presenting with the sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and palpitations. His name is Mr. John Jones  and he lives with his wife in downtown San Diego  California. Mr. Jones is a retired engineer and an ex-smoker  having quit smoking five years ago after a 40-year smoking history.  Past Medical History:  In terms of his past medical history  Mr. Jones was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes twenty years ago  which he manages with metformin and lifestyle adjustments. He also suffered a myocardial infarction seven years ago  and is on aspirin and statins since then.   He underwent a hip replacement surgery three weeks ago and has been relatively immobile during his post-operation recovery. Given his recent surgery and low activity levels  he stands at a significant risk of developing a venous thromboembolic event. There is also a family history of Pulmonary embolism  suggesting a possible genetic predisposition.  Current presentation:  Today  his wife brought him into the Emergency Department worried about his sudden difficulty in breathing and feeling faint. On arrival  he displayed classic signs of a pulmonary embolism  such as tachypnea  slight hypoxia  and a rapid heart rate. His blood tests indicated a slightly elevated D-dimer  triggering concern for a thromboembolic event.  Conclusion:  In conclusion  given Mr. Jones's current symptoms of shortness of breath  chest pain and tachycardia  along with his risk factors including his recent immobilization due to hip surgery  a long history of smoking and diabetes  pulmonary embolism should be highly suspected. His elevated D-dimer also supports this suspicion.   Further appropriate diagnostic imaging such as a CT pulmonary angiography should be pursued promptly. If this diagnosis is confirmed  initiation of anticoagulation therapy would be the immediate next step to prevent further clot propagation and secondary complications.

His blood pressure was elevated. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.   Slide 6: Preliminary Diagnosis  Considering John's presenting symptoms and recent surgery (a known risk factor)  the primary concern is acute pulmonary embolism.  Slide 7: Investigations  We plan to confirm our suspicion with a D-Dimer test  followed by CT Pulmonary Angiography if D-Dimers are elevated.   Also  complete blood count  chest X-Ray  EKG and blood cultures will be done to rule out other potential causes of his symptoms.  Slide 8: Conclusion   John's case illustrates the importance of considering Pulmonary Embolism in patients who present with sudden onset chest pain and dyspnea  particularly those with significant risk factors like recent surgery. Timely detection  diagnosis  and management can be life-saving in such situations.

9,1,14,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial14,Presentation Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Male   Introduction:  Presenting today is Mr. John Doe  a 57-year-old Caucasian male who was admitted to the hospital emergency department approximately two hours ago. Mr. Doe was brought in due to a sudden onset of shortness of breath  sharp chest pain radiating to his left shoulder  light-headedness  and coughing up blood-tinged sputum.   Demographics:  Mr. Doe is a married gentleman with two adult children. He lives in suburban Atlanta  Georgia  and works as an accountant. He has never smoked  drinks socially  and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to his occupation.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe was diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago  which is managed with a daily dose of Losartan 50 mg. His mother had a stroke at the age of 65. His family history also includes a brother who has deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  suggesting a possible genetic predisposition to clotting disorders.   Recent Medical Events:   Two weeks ago  Mr. Doe underwent an arthroscopic knee surgery for a torn meniscus. Post-surgery  he was prescribed analgesics and was less mobile due to discomfort  which could have contributed to his current condition.  Clinical Assessment:  On examination  Mr. Doe is anxiously positioned in a sitting position  as it's most comfortable for his breathing. His heart rate is tachycardic at 110 bpm  respirations are fast at 24 breaths per minute; blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg; oxygen saturation levels are low at 92% on room air  indicating hypoxemia. On auscultation  breath sounds are decreased in the left lower zone  and his left leg is swollen and tender on palpation.  Impression and Diagnosis:  Given his presenting symptoms  recent surgery  and family history of DVT  an acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is suspected.   Plan:  An urgent D-dimer test  chest CT angiography  and Doppler ultrasound of his left leg will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. If the results are positive for PE  he will be initiated on anticoagulant therapy and possibly thrombolytic therapy if the situation worsens  considering the risk and benefits.  In conclusion  Mr. Doe’s case highlights the importance of considering pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with shortness of breath and chest pain  especially when they have risk factors such as recent immobilization and family history of DVT.
9,1,15,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial15,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-aged Male  Patient Profile: The patient is a 52-year-old Caucasian male  married  employed as an international sales representative  with a 27 pack-year smoking history. He drinks alcohol socially (2-3 drinks per week) and denies any illicit drug use. His BMI falls into the overweight category (BMI=28).  Medical History: The patient has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 7 years and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 3 years ago. His father had a heart attack at age 55  and his mother has a history of recurrent deep vein thrombosis. His medication regimen includes Metformin  Lisinopril  and a daily low-dose aspirin regimen.  Current Situation: The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain  shortness of breath  diaphoresis  and palpitations that started a few hours ago while he was sitting on a long trans-Atlantic flight. He rates his pain as a 7 on a scale of 1-10 and describes it as a sharp  stabbing pain that worsens with deep breaths.  On physical examination: He was anxious and mildly diaphoretic  with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  heart rate 98 bpm  blood pressure 146/92  oxygen saturation 91% on room air and temperature 37.1 degrees Celsius. On auscultation  his breath sounds were slightly diminished in the lower lobes bilaterally  without wheezing  crackles or rubs. His heart sounds were normal rhythm without murmurs. Lower extremity exam did not reveal any obvious signs of deep vein thrombosis such as edema  pain on palpation  or discoloration.  This clinical scenario  coupled with his risk factors (long-duration sedentary travel  smoking history  family history of venous thromboembolism  and personal history of hypertension and diabetes) suggests a high likelihood of an acute pulmonary embolism. Immediate further evaluation with D-dimer  Troponin test and radiographic imaging are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and guide immediate management.
9,1,16,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial16,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of sudden onset chest pain and slight shortness of breath. Mr. Smith is a pack-a-day smoker and leads a fairly sedentary lifestyle. His BMI is 29  indicating that he is overweight. He works a desk job and reports long periods of sitting. He also reports recent long-haul travel- a 6-hour plane ride for work a week prior to this acute presentation.  Past Medical History  Mr. Smith underwent a total knee replacement two years ago  but reports no other past surgeries. He has a medical history of well-controlled hypertension and was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes five years ago. He does not have any known respiratory diseases  no known clotting disorders  and no family history of thromboembolic events. The patient's medication regimen includes daily Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for anti-hypertension  and Simvastatin for hypercholesterolemia.  Current Presentation   The patient reports that the chest pain is sharp and increases with deep breaths. The pain is localized on the left side of the mid-chest area. He rates his perceived exertion as 5 out of 10 at rest but can increase up to 7 out of 10 during exertion. He reports a low-grade fever but denies any other symptoms such as coughing  blood in sputum  wheezing or swelling in leg veins. On examination  his respiratory rate was slightly increased to 22 breaths per minute  blood pressure was 136/90 mm Hg  and O2 saturation was 93% on room air.  All these clinical signs and symptoms  along with his recent travel history  sedentary lifestyle  and being overweight  raise suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). We have requested a D-dimer test  and are considering a CT pulmonary angiogram to confirm the diagnosis if required. Appropriate action and treatment will be undertaken based on the further diagnostic findings. 
9,1,17,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial17,Patient Presentation  Patient's Title: Mrs.   Demographic Information:   Full Name: Mrs. Jane Smith  Age: 65 years  Gender: Female  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Teacher  Marital Status: Widowed  Religion: Catholic  Language: English   Presenting Issue: Presenting with sudden shortness of breath  chest pain which has worsened on deep breathing  and a fever of 38 degrees Celsius.   Smoking History: Mrs. Smith is a non-smoker.  Alcohol Intake: She drinks alcohol occasionally.  Drug History: No history of illicit drug use.  Family History: Her mother died at 75 due to congestive heart failure.   Past Medical History:   Mrs. Smith has been medically managed for Type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years. She was diagnosed with hypertension 7 years ago  which is well-controlled with medication. She also has hyperlipidemia  for which she takes a statin. She underwent a cholecystectomy 5 years ago. Mrs. Smith also suffered from a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after a long-haul flight 3-years ago and has been on Rivaroxaban ever since.   Current Medication:   1. Metformin for diabetes 2. Lisinopril for hypertension  3. Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia  4. Rivaroxaban for DVT history  Allergies: She is allergic to penicillin  which causes a rash.  Social History: Mrs. Smith enjoys spending time with her two grown-up children and four grandchildren. She enjoys gardening and going for walks in her local park.  Based on the above-highlighted history and sudden onset of symptoms  the patient might be experiencing an acute pulmonary embolism  which is very likely due to her past DVT history. Immediate diagnostic testing and potential medical intervention are crucial.   This overall suspecting diagnosis could potentially be based on well-known risk factors such as age  history of DVT  and the presence of chronic diseases like diabetes  hypertension. Furthermore  the symptoms which Jane Smith is presenting with are typical indications of a possible acute pulmonary embolism. The worsening chest pain during deep breathing  sudden onset shortness of breath  and low-grade fever are all worrisome red flags for this condition.

Current Presentation: Mr. Doe reports the sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain that began approximately six hours ago and has progressively worsened. He also complains of shortness of breath  which is more noticeable upon exertion. He denies any cough  fever  or contact with sick persons. He mentions that over the past week  he has noticed sharp  intermittent left calf pain. According to the patient  his leg pain and breathlessness have made it increasingly difficult to participate in his usual daily walks.  Examination: On examination  Mr. Doe is in obvious distress. He is afebrile with tachycardia (heart rate of 110 beats per minute) and slightly tachypneic. His blood pressure is stable. Examination of the chest reveals decreased breath sounds on the right lung field. His left calf appears mildly swollen and warm to touch compared to the right.  Probable Diagnosis:  Given the patient’s recent history of surgery  his symptoms  the physical findings  and his cardiovascular risk factors  a working diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is considered.  Further Investigations: Further investigations have been planned to confirm the diagnosis  which include D-dimer assay  computer tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)  and a Doppler ultrasound of his left leg to look for deep vein thrombosis.  It is an urgent case  which needs immediate attention and management to prevent catastrophic outcomes. The patient has been immediately started on an anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin per hospital protocol  pending investigation results.   In conclusion  recognition of high risk patients and timely diagnosis will improve the prognosis for Mr. Doe and others with suspected acute pulmonary embolism.

9,1,21,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial21,Subject: Patient Presentation - Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Name: Mr. Matthew Reynolds Age: 52  Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Driver  Presenting Problem: Mr. Reynolds has recently been referred to our department from his primary healthcare provider presenting symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism. He has been experiencing difficulty breathing  chest pain  and occasional coughing  with the signs of lightheadedness and faintness.   Past Medical History: The patient has a significant medical history relevant to his current illness. He was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) five years ago  a condition which predisposes to the development of PE. Mr. Reynolds also has a history of smoking  and although a former smoker  he smoked two packs of cigarettes a day for approximately 20 years. Besides  he has a family history of heart diseases. He has been under medication for hypertension for the past ten years.   Risk Factors: It is observed that Mr. Reynolds is overweight with a BMI of 30. Being a long-distance driver  he stays in a seated position for long periods - a sedentary lifestyle is a known risk factor for clot formation. His age also inclines him towards an increased risk for PE  as older adults are more susceptible.   Clinical Note:  Further investigations are scheduled for tomorrow  which includes a chest CT scan and D-dimer blood test to confirm the diagnosis. Meanwhile  he has been prescribed anticoagulants and advised to remain active to enhance blood circulations. The patient's immediate and extended family have been advised on the situation and necessary precautions for PE.   In conclusion  Mr. Reynolds represents a typical case of an acute pulmonary embolism with observable risk factors including age  past medical history  and lifestyle. However  further investigations are necessary to firmly establish the diagnosis and guide the development of a management plan.  It is planned to discuss the prognosis  lifestyle modifications  and the necessity of regular follow-ups during his next appointment.
9,1,22,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial22,Title: Case Presentation: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Profile: The patient is Mrs. Rhoda Jenkins  a 66-year-old African-American female. She lives with her retired husband in a small town in Oregon. Her BMI (Body Mass Index) is 28  thus marking her in the 'overweight' category. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol only in moderation during social events. Occasionally  she also endures bouts of anxiety.  Presenting Illness: Mrs. Jenkins presented to the ER with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  palpitations  and light-headedness following an 8-hour car journey.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Jenkins has a history of hypertension  which is controlled with Lisinopril. She is also a borderline type 2 diabetic  currently managed with diet and healthy lifestyle modifications. Her surgical history includes a total knee replacement six months ago  which was followed by a 2-month period of prolonged immobility. Notably  she has a family history of thromboembolic disorders; her mother suffered from deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Her regular medications include Lisinopril and a daily Aspirin regimen  started after a careful calculation of coronary disease risk 3 years ago. She is also on a statin for her moderately high cholesterol levels.  Mental Health:  Mrs. Jenkins occasionally encounters anxiety episodes for which she undergoes cognitive behavioral therapy but is not any psychiatric medication.  Allergies: She has a reported allergy to Penicillin which causes a non-anaphylactic rash.  Examination and Investigation: She appeared anxious and breathless on arrival. Her vital signs were as follows: BP- 145/90mmHg  HR- 118/min  SpO2- 91% on room air  RR- 22/min  Temp- 37.6℃. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable. Lab tests showed elevated D-dimer levels. An urgent CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed the presence of a bilateral pulmonary embolism.  This presentation is epidemiologically consistent with Pulmonary Embolism (PE)  and the recent immobility following knee surgery confirmed the likelihood of the diagnosis. Hence  the patient will be managed and monitored as per the standard treatment protocol.
9,1,23,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial23,Slide 1: Patient Presentation - Name: Mr. Johnson - Age: 72 years old  - Sex: Male  - Race: Caucasian  Slide 2: Chief Complaint - Mr. Johnson presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain that started three hours ago at home.  Slide 3: Associated Symptoms - Patient also reports feeling light-headed  with an intermittent cough occasionally bringing up blood-streaked phlegm.  Slide 4: Personal Medical History - Mr. Johnson has a history of well-controlled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus and was a smoker for 40 years (quit 10 years ago).   Slide 5: Recent Events  - Mr. Johnson had a total knee replacement surgery two weeks prior and had been mostly bed-ridden since the surgery.   Slide 6: Family Medical History - His elder brother died of myocardial infarction at a relatively young age (50 years old) and his mother suffers from deep venous thrombosis.  Slide 7: Social History - He lives alone  upstate  and is retired. He does not consume alcohol or use illicit substances.   Slide 8: Current Medications - He’s currently on metformin for diabetes  lisinopril for hypertension  and had been receiving subcutaneous heparin for thromboprophylaxis postoperatively.  Slide 9: Physical Examination - On examination  the patient looks anxious with some signs of respiratory distress. Vitals reveal a high heart rate at 115 beats per minute and oxygen saturation reading of 88%.  Slide 10: Impression & Plan  - Given his sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  hypoxia and recent surgery  the clinical suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism is very high. Further diagnostic testing will be conducted immediately including a D-dimer test  CT pulmonary angiography  and possibly a VQ scan to confirm the diagnosis and guide further treatment.
9,1,24,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial24,Patient Presentation  Today  our patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian female named Mrs. Wilson  who presents with complaints of acute onset shortness of breath and a sharp  stabbing chest pain radiating to the back. The patient reports that the symptoms began earlier this afternoon while she was gardening  and has been progressively worsening.  Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  well-controlled with amlodipine 5mg once daily and atorvastatin 20mg once daily  respectively. She had an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) ten years ago and completed the standard course of anticoagulation with warfarin. She also has a positive family history of pulmonary embolism in her father. She is a former smoker  quit smoking 15 years ago  has a history of occasional alcohol usage  and denies any recreational drug use.   Mrs. Wilson has no known drug allergies and is currently not on any supplemental medications. She recently took a long haul flight  spending the past month abroad with her family. Although limited mobility during this travel time might have predisposed her to thromboembolism  it is still a differential to be considered.  The combination of her medical history  current symptomatology  and recent travel strongly suggests a possible case of acute pulmonary embolism. However  we will need further assessments and diagnostic tests (including D-Dimer  CT pulmonary angiogram  etc.) to rule out other differential diagnoses and confirm this suspicion.   The subsequent plan of care will involve addressing her acute symptoms  initiating appropriate therapeutic interventions  assessing her risk factors  strategies for future DVT/PE prevention  and a thorough follow-up plan.
9,1,25,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial25,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 63-year-old Female  Introduction: I present a case of a 63-year-old African American female patient who has been diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.  Demographics: The patient is a retired high school teacher  she has lived the majority of her life in New York City. She's a widow and resides with her two middle-aged children. She has a previous history of drinking and smoking but reports to have discontinued consumption and smoking for the past 15 years. She has no known drug allergies.  Past Medical History: Her past medical history is significant for systemic hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are medically managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively. Five years ago  she was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus which is controlled with Metformin. She has had no previous surgeries but states that four months prior  she sustained a leg fracture due to a fall in her home  for which she had been immobilized and bed-ridden for a couple of weeks.  Presenting Symptoms: She has reported acute onset of chest pain  shortness of breath  light-headedness  and palpitations  which have been progressing over the past few hours. According to her  the chest discomfort is sharp  located in the middle of her chest and becomes worse upon deep breaths.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  she was tachycardic with a heart rate of 118 beats per minute  her blood pressure was 145/85mmHg  respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute and her oxygen saturation was 89% at room air  which improved to 95% with 3 liters of oxygen via a nasal cannula.  Inference: The combination of the patient's history of recent immobilization due to her leg fracture  her current symptoms  and her physical examination findings lead us to the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment: The patient has been started on a heparin drip and we are considering further diagnostic testing to confirm the diagnosis. Further management will be guided by her response to the initial treatment  diagnostic findings  overall health status  and her decision-making capacity.    Conclusion: This case exemplifies a classical presentation of acute pulmonary embolism occurring in an already medically compromised individual due to prolonged immobility. As part of the care plan  the addition of a consult with the physical therapy team for early mobilization and prophylactic anticoagulation should be contemplated.
9,1,26,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial26,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Patient Presentation  Demographics  Patient Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 55 years  Sex: Male  Occupation: Office worker Ethnicity: Caucasian Current Address: Boston  Massachusetts  Clinical History:   The patient presented into the emergency department (ED)  complaining of a sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain that developed over a couple of hours while at work. The pain alleviated slightly when he was at rest. The patient also noted a sense of anxiety and a feeling of faintness  but no syncope. His current vital signs upon arrival were: BP 140/90 mmHg  HR 110 bpm  RR 22 breaths/min and SpO2 90% room air. No recent travel  surgeries  hospitalizations or infectious symptoms were reported.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago after a 20-year pack history. He has a history of chronic hypertension (managed with Lisinopril) and hyperlipidemia (controlled with Atorvastatin). There is no personal or familial history of deep vein thrombosis or blood clotting disorder  nor are there any previous episodes of pulmonary embolism.   Family History:  The patient's father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60 and his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at 53. His elder brother is hypertensive.   Social History:  He uses alcohol socially  denying any illicit drug use. He lives with his wife and two children  and is moderately active. His job involves sitting for long hours. The patient keeps up with routine physical check-ups and screening procedures  including annual wellness visits and has had twice-yearly lipid profiles for the past 5 years.  Review of System:  All other systems were reviewed and considered negative  apart from his reported respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms.   Based on this patient presentation  an acute pulmonary embolism is suspected  and further diagnostic tests including D-dimer test  CT pulmonary angiogram and EKG will be recommended. Subsequently  the medical team will initiate supportive measures – oxygen therapy and potentially anticoagulation treatment – based on the diagnostic findings.
9,1,27,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial27,Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Doe is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presents himself to the emergency room with a chief complaint of acute shortness of breath that began abruptly two hours ago. He also describes a sensation of chest pain radiating to his left shoulder and associated with severe weakness  dizziness and a sudden bout of coughing  with traces of blood found in his sputum.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has been diagnosed with hypertension for which he has been taking medication for the past 15 years. Also  he has a history of hypercholesterolemia. He quit smoking tobacco two years ago  after a total of 30 years of smoking. No known drug allergies have been reported. He had surgery for a right hip replacement 6 weeks ago for which he was immobilized for several weeks.   Family History:  Mr. Doe's father had a history of myocardial infarction at the age of 72 and his mother was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in her late 60s. His maternal aunt died from an unconfirmed cause  but the family suspects it was a stroke.   Social History:  Mr. Doe is a retired bank manager and lives with his wife. He quit smoking 2 years ago but has a history of heavy alcohol use  although he has been sober for 10 years. He does not perform any regular or strenuous exercise. He is not on any special diet and has a preference for high-fat foods.  Review of Systems:  Mr. Doe reports a significant decrease in exercise tolerance in recent months and an associated weight gain of 10 pounds. He has denied fever  chills  night sweats  headaches  vision change  or recent travel. He reports no changes in bowel or bladder habits.  Given the presenting symptoms  clinical history  recent surgery  and immobilization  there seems to be a high index of suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism  and immediate diagnostic workup  including D-dimer testing and imaging studies  is recommended.
9,1,28,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial28,Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presents with a sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and a rapid pulse. The patient reported that the symptoms started abruptly a few hours before his ER arrival.  Past medical history reveals that Mr. Doe is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history who quit 10 years ago. He has been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and suffers occasional flare-ups but is otherwise well-managed on inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators. He also has stage 2 hypertension controlled with lisinopril. His only other significant history is of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in his left leg five years earlier  managed with a 6-month course of anticoagulation.   Mr. Doe also reported recent surgery for total hip replacement four weeks ago  spending most of his time in physical rehabilitation and been sedentary for extended periods.   There is no reported history of chest trauma  asthma  lung cancer  tuberculosis  or previous pneumothoraces. He has no known allergies.   Family history reveals both parents had cardiovascular diseases. His father had an MI at age 56  and his mother suffered from chronic heart failure.  Conclusion:  In light of the patient's history  especially the recent orthopedic surgery  previous history of DVT  COPD  sudden onset of symptoms  it is highly suggestive that Mr. Doe is suffering from an acute episode of pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic evaluation and interventions are urgently needed for this potentially life threatening condition.

9,1,29,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial29,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jones  a 67-year-old African-American male  presents to the emergency department with signs and symptoms suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). He has a past medical history of obesity  type II diabetes mellitus  and hypertension  and has been a 30 pack-year smoker. His medications include oral metformin for diabetes  lisinopril and atenolol for hypertension. Also  he had a total knee replacement surgery six weeks ago.   Over the past several days  the patient started experiencing sudden onset chest pain that radiates to his left shoulder  along with shortness of breath and hemoptysis. Mr. Jones also describes experiencing a rapid heart rate and feeling dizzy recently.  His family history is notable for a sister who was diagnosed with PE years ago  and both his father and older brother died from some form of cardiovascular disease.   This presentation of acute chest pain  dyspnea  and hemoptysis  combined with the risk factors of obesity  smoking  recent surgery  and family history of PE  raises significant concerns about the possibility of an acute pulmonary embolism  warranting immediate investigation and treatment.
9,1,30,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial30,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Post-operative Patient   Introduction Patient Details: Ms. Rebecca Adams  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of breathlessness and chest pain. The breathlessness started abruptly while she was resting at home and has been progressively worsening since then.  Past Medical History: Ms. Adams is a known case of Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  both of which have been reasonably well controlled with medications. She underwent a total right hip replacement procedure approximately three weeks ago  for which her recovery was uneventful until now. Ms. Adams had also been admitted to hospital 5 years ago for an ischemic stroke but reports a full recovery with no residual deficits.  Presenting Symptoms: Ms. Adams describes the chest pain as sudden in onset  moderately severe  and pleuritic in nature. She denies any history of cardiac disease but has acute dyspnea  cyanosis  and tachycardia. Upon physical examination  the patient was distressed and diaphoretic  with an arterial oxygen saturation of 89% on room air.   Possible Diagnosis: Given her recent orthopedic surgery  her symptoms and physical signs point towards an acute episode of pulmonary embolism  a known post-operative complication. To confirm this  an urgent chest CT angiogram and D-dimer testing have been ordered  as characterized by minimally invasive and widely available diagnostic tools for PE.   Conclusion: Ms. Rebecca Adams might have experienced an acute pulmonary embolism  which is a potentially life-threatening condition if not recognized and treated promptly. She will require immediate anticoagulant treatment once the diagnosis is confirmed  and further recommendations for chronic anticoagulation therapy shall be based on her risk assessment to prevent future thromboembolic episodes. We also need to consider that this might not be a straightforward cardiac event given her past medical history  but a multi-organ condition that will require complex management.
9,1,31,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial31,Patient Introduction:  We are presenting the case of Mrs. Joan Simpson  a 65-year-old Caucasian female  who is a non-smoker and lives independently at home. She has been diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism. She is an active individual  frequently participating in low-impact exercises like walking and swimming.  Demographics:  Mrs. Simpson is a retired nurse. She lives with her husband and has a history of occasional alcohol consumption. She is the mother of two children and has four grandkids.   Medical History:  There is a significant past medical history to note. Mrs. Simpson has been managing her hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus for the past 10 years  regulated by medication. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a previous hip replacement surgery around 5 years ago.  Current Presentation:  She was presented to the emergency department after developing a sudden onset of breathlessness  cough  and sharp  stabbing chest pain over the last 12 hours. The chest pain was intensified upon deep inspiration. She also reported a feeling of apprehensiveness. On examination  she was found to be tachypnoeic and tachycardic. Syncope and hemoptysis were not noted.  Investigations:  Her vitals were checked  and an electrocardiogram  chest-X-ray  complete blood count  arterial blood gas (ABG)  D-dimer  troponin levels  and CT pulmonary angiogram were recommended based on her symptoms for confirming the diagnosis and ruling out other conditions.  Conclusion:  In conclusion  Mrs. Simpson  due to her medical history and the current presentation  is an ideal example of acute pulmonary embolism. Immediate management by the multidisciplinary team is required to prevent adverse outcomes. The response will be monitored  and adjustments will be made accordingly to her therapeutic regimen.
9,1,32,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial32,Introduction:   Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presented with symptoms suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism.  Demographic information:  The patient resides in a suburban neighborhood in New York and is a retired engineer. He lives with his wife  and occasionally  with visiting grandchildren. The patient is a former smoker with a 30-year pack history  having quit 15 years ago. He does not consume alcohol or illicit drugs. He maintains a balanced diet  but his physical activity is limited due to arthritis.   Presenting Symptoms:  He arrived in the Emergency Department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath and chest discomfort. The patient rates his pain as 7 on a scale of 10  which he describes as sharp and radiating to the back. He also reports lightheadedness and faster-than-normal heartbeat. He has no history of such symptoms.   Past Medical History:  The patient has past medical history of autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) secondary to his prior tobacco use. The rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed approximately 10 years ago and is well controlled with methotrexate. As for COPD  it has been managed using bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids successfully.   In addition  he has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) around 5 years ago. The DVT was treated with warfarin for 6 months  and no subsequent recurrent DVT events were noted in his medical records.  Family History:  His father passed on due to a heart attack in his 70s  and his mother has Alzheimer's disease. There's a notable absence of any known familial coagulopathies.  Medication:  His regular medications include methotrexate for the rheumatoid arthritis  and combination bronchodilator/inhaled corticosteroid for his COPD.  Allergic Status:  The patient has no known allergies to medications.  Conclusion:  Given his signs  symptoms  and past medical history  an acute pulmonary embolism was suspected upon admission. Urgent investigations  including an ECG  D-dimer  and chest CT-angiogram  were performed to confirm the diagnosis. Further medical therapeutic management was done according to the current PE guidelines. He is also referred to a Hematologist for appropriate secondary prevention given his past history of DVT. 
9,1,33,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial33,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Case Presentation  Patient Information:  • Name: Mr. John Smith  • Gender: Male • Age: 62 years • Race: Caucasian • Occupation: Retired Teacher • Marital Status: Married  Presenting Symptomology:   Mr. Smith presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain that intensifies with deep breaths  and a sense of impending doom. He has a cough and is also mildly tachypneic at 24 breaths per minute. The patient's pulse rate has increased to 110 beats per minute.  Clinical History:  • Mr. Smith has a significant past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 2 years ago for which he had been on periodic anticoagulant therapy. • He has a 10-year history of Type 2 Diabetes mellitus. • Hypertension diagnosed 7 years ago. • He experienced a mild stroke 5 years ago. • He is a former smoker  quit 12 years ago. • Family history of cardiovascular disease.  Medication:  Currently  Mr. Smith is on oral metformin 500 mg twice daily  losartan 50 mg once daily  and aspirin 81 mg once in a day.   Investigation and Results:   Considering the patient's past medical history and current symptoms  a high-resolution CT chest was done immediately following triage and lab investigations were ordered which revealed the presence of a clot in the right pulmonary artery indicating a pulmonary embolism.   Hospital Course:   Given the patient’s history and presenting symptoms  he was diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and anticoagulation therapy was promptly initiated with the administration of heparin  followed by oral anticoagulants for long-term management.  Mr. Smith's condition improved over the course of a week. He has been advised to continue oral anticoagulant therapy and regular check-ups will be needed to monitor his condition.
9,1,34,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial34,Patient Presentation:  I would like to present an evaluation of a 65-year-old female  Mrs. Jane McDowell  who arrived at our emergency department today complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath  sharp and stabbing chest pain prone to worsening with deep breaths  and light-headedness. Mrs. McDowell has also reported experiencing a cough producing blood-streaked sputum  noticeable heart palpitations  and excessive sweating in the last two hours.  Mrs. McDowell is a Caucasian woman. She is a non-smoker  maintains a sedentary lifestyle  consumes alcohol in moderation  and has no known drug allergies. She has a BMI of 25.8 kg/m2.   For past medical history  Mrs. McDowell has been treated for hypertension for the past ten years by her primary care physician and has been on Lisinopril. She has had no known history of any pulmonary diseases in the past. She has not undergone any recent surgical intervention but reports a significant period of bed rest following a knee injury and resulting immobility three weeks earlier. Her mother had a history of deep vein thrombosis  but no other familial history of thromboembolic disease is known.   That covers the initial demographic and past medical and familial history. Currently  based on her persisting symptoms and risk factors  namely her sedentary lifestyle  recent immobilization  and family history of thrombosis  we are suspecting a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. However  further diagnostic testing like chest computed tomography (CT) scan  pulmonary angiogram  and D-dimer blood tests are needed to confirm. The patient has been administered oxygen therapy for immediate relief of symptoms and anticoagulants to prevent further clot formation.
9,1,35,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial35,Title: Presentation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism Case  I. Introduction Patient's name: Mr. Jameson Gray. He is a 60-year-old Caucasian male and a retired coal miner who is currently occupying two roles as a husband and a father of three grown children with six grandchildren. Mr. Gray lives at Barnstone  Nottinghamshire.  II. Presenting Complaints Mr. Gray presented to the hospital with sudden onset of shortness of breath for approximately 6-7 hours  accompanied by moderate to severe chest pain that he says began suddenly while resting. He also reported experiencing light-headedness  palpitations  and feelings of extreme anxiety.   III. Medical History 1. Hypertension: Mr. Gray has been suffering from hypertension for 10 years. His BP has been often monitored  averaging within 140/90 mmHg and he has been on antihypertensive medication (Amlodipine and Lisinopril).  2. Type II Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was diagnosed with DM 7 years ago  currently regulated with oral metformin and regular glucose monitoring.  3. Smoker: He has a 40-year history of smoking  which he quit about five years ago but had previously been consuming approximately a pack of cigarettes per day.  4. Past Lower Limb Injury: Mr. Gray sustained a lower limb fracture 5 years ago and had undergone surgery.  IV. Review of Systems Mr. Gray reported shortness of breath at rest  worsened by any form of activity  associated with chest discomfort. He denied any cough  fever  or weight change. There's evidence of peripheral edema and calf pain  raising the suspicion of deep vein thrombosis as a possible source of emboli.  In conclusion  based on his presenting signs and symptoms  and considering his past medical history and age  Mr. Gray has been identified as a high-risk patient  who displays symptoms suggestive of Acute Pulmonary Embolism. Detailed diagnostic tests including Doppler ultrasound  D-dimer tests  and Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) will be arranged to confirm the diagnosis. Prompt treatment will be initiated given his classification as a high-risk patient.
9,1,36,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial36,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 62-Year-Old Female Patient   Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen   Today  We'll be discussing a case of a 62-year-old Caucasian female patient named Mrs. Emily who presented with acute pulmonary embolism.   Patient Information:  - Age: 62 years - Sex: Female  - Race: Caucasian  The patient is a retired schoolteacher who had been maintaining a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and routine walks. She had no known allergies. She was a non-smoker and minimized her alcohol intake to moderation.   Past Medical History:  Mrs. Emily's medical history revealed she had a laparoscopic hysterectomy 2 weeks ago. Prior to this  she had had no major illness apart from high blood pressure (hypertension) and hyperlipidemia. She had been on medications  Amlodipine 5mg daily for hypertension and Simvastatin 20mg daily for hyperlipidemia.  Presenting Complaint: On that day of presentation  she complained of a sudden onset of shortness of breath accompanied by pleuritic chest pain. She also reported light-headedness  sweating  and a sense of palpitation.    Upon physical examination  she was found to be hypoxic with mild cyanosis and tachycardic. She also had a low-grade fever.   Preliminary Diagnosis: Based on her presenting symptoms  recent surgery  and the results of her physical examination  an acute pulmonary embolism was suspected.   Investigations: A D-dimer test was done which came out positive. An urgent computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the presence of bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Treatment & Management: The patient was immediately admitted to the Intensive Care Unit  where she was started on intravenous anticoagulants to prevent further embolic events and symptomatic management was done for her dyspnea and chest pain.  In conclusion: This case emphasized the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in patients with recent surgery presenting with sudden dyspnea and other related symptoms. It serves as a reminder to us that early diagnosis and management can lead to promising outcomes.   Thank you.
9,1,37,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial37,Title: Case Presentation on Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: Mr. James Thompson is a 72-year-old Caucasian male. He resides in Brooklyn  New York and is retired from his job as a civil engineer. He has been a non-smoker his entire life  drinks moderate alcohol  and has no known drug abuse history. He is a widower with two adult children. He denies any recent history of international travel and does not have a history of prolonged immobilization. His father died of a heart attack at age 75  and his mother died of old age.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia approximately 10 years ago  both of which have been relatively well-controlled with medication – Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively. He also has a history of gout  which has been asymptomatic with Allopurinol.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Thompson now presents with a sudden onset of dyspnea  sharp chest pain  cough with bloody sputum  and light-headedness that started approximately 72 hours ago. He has also experienced dramatic diaphoresis  and his daughter noticed his cyanotic lips and increased anxiety. According to his family  he has been maintaining his drugs and diet well and there has been no recent alteration.  Clinical Assessment: On a physical examination  his vital signs are: blood pressure 160/90  pulse rate 100/min  respiration 24/min  and temperature 37.1°C. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in his left lung  with crackles heard throughout. His heart rate is tachycardic but regular with a soft S1  S2. A lower limb examination revealed slight paunchiness and redness of the left lower limb.   Given his symptoms and physical examination findings  there is a suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism. Next steps would involve further laboratory investigations such as D-dimer levels  Arterial blood gases  Complete Blood Count  and likely imaging such as CT pulmonary angiography or a V/Q scan.  Plan of Management: Upon arrival  the emergency team initiated oxygen therapy and IV access  and provided analgesia to manage his pain. Following confirmation of an acute pulmonary embolism with diagnostic testing  anticoagulant therapy like heparin infusion will be commenced. This will be later transitioned to oral anticoagulants such as Warfarin. His stay in the ICU will be required for monitoring his vitals and his response to treatment  after which pulmonary and cardiovascular rehabilitation could be considered. Prompt intervention at this stage will be aimed at clot resolution and preventing recurrence of thromboembolic disease  thereby minimizing risk of post-PE syndrome.
9,1,38,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial38,Patient Presentation:  Our patient today is a 62-year-old African American female named Mrs.A  who is presenting with an acute pulmonary embolism.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient was rushed to the hospital with sudden-onset shortness of breath  sharp chest pain which worsened with deep breaths  occasional bouts of cough with streaks of blood  and lightheadedness.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. A's past medical history includes Hypertension  which is under control with regular medication (Lisinopril)  as well as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  for which she takes Metformin. She underwent a total knee replacement five years ago and has been on long-term contraceptive use (oral contraceptive pills) for menopausal symptoms. Moreover  she has a 30-pack year history of smoking but quit 10 years prior to this presentation.  Family History:  Her family history is significant for deep vein thrombosis in her mother and maternal uncle.  Social History:  Mrs. A is a retired teacher. She is married and lives with her husband. She does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She was an active smoker but ceased it 10 years back.  On physical examination:  Vital signs reveal a slightly accelerated heart rate (110 beats per minute)  elevated blood pressure (140/85 mmHg)  respiratory rate 22 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs shows decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes of the right lung; the remainder of the lungs are clear. The rest of the physical examination  including the cardiac and abdominal exams  are within normal limits. The lower extremity examination does not reveal any signs of deep vein thrombosis.  In conclusion  Mrs. A is a 62-year-old African American woman who is presenting with symptoms that are highly suspicious of acute pulmonary embolism—a condition which her risk factors  such as history of hypertension  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  long-term contraceptive use  and a family history of thrombotic events place her at an increased risk for. We need to facilitate further investigations to confirm.

9,1,44,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial44,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: Case Study  Presentation:  I would like to present the case of a patient who came to us with Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE).   Demographics:  The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian male. He is independent in activities of daily living  retired  has a history of smoking 1 pack per day for 40 years and lives with his wife in a suburban residential location. He has never been admitted to a hospital for similar symptoms before.   History:  We will discuss the patient's past medical history now. The patient has a significant past medical history of Hypertension diagnosed 5 years ago  managed with oral medications. However  the patient has been non-compliant with his medications for the past few months due to increased stress levels.   There is also a history of Type II Diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 7 years ago  managed with both dietary control and Metformin. Moreover  the patient recently had a right lower limb fracture that was managed conservatively. However  he remained bedridden for about 6 weeks post-accident. This immobile period likely contributed to the acute event of pulmonary embolism.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient reported sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain was 'stabbing' in nature  localized to the middle of the chest  and aggravated by deep breathing. The patient also described light-headedness  an increased heart rate  and a bit of blood in his cough.  Conclusion:  To summarize  we have a 63-year-old male with a good history of hypertension  diabetes  and prolonged immobility due to a recent injury  who presents with chest pain  breathing difficulty  elevated heart rate  and blood in expectoration indicative of an Acute Pulmonary Embolism. Immediate intervention was undertaken for diagnostic confirmation and treatment due to the life-threatening nature of the condition.

9,1,47,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial47,Patient Presentation:  The patient presenting before us today is Ms. Jane Doe  a 58-year-old Caucasian woman  who works as an accountant. She has lived in Chicago  Illinois  for most of her adult life. Jane is currently living with her husband and has two adult children. She has been a non-smoker for her entire life.  In terms of her past medical history  she has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia  hypertension  and type II diabetes. She had been maintaining a relatively good health with her on-going medications controlling her conditions. However  two years ago  she underwent a total hysterectomy due to the presence of large uterine fibroids. Post-surgery  she experienced deep vein thrombosis  which was managed effectively with anticoagulants.  Presenting Condition:  Today  Ms. Doe arrived at the emergency department with sudden onset acute shortness of breath  chest pain  and a sense of impending doom  which started while she was at rest. The chest pain is sharp  radiates to the back  and is exacerbated with deep breathing. She mentioned she had been more sedentary than usual over the past week due to an increased workload and long hours at her desk.  She is noticeably tachypneic  tachycardic  appears anxious and the oxygen saturation on room air is around 93%. On auscultating the chest  no clear abnormalities are detected  the heart sounds are tachycardiac  no extra sounds or murmurs observed.  These symptoms and her history points towards a possible diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism. Further investigations with diagnostic imaging and a D-dimer test will be useful to confirm the diagnosis.  In the meantime  Jane needs to be stabilized  with a focus on improving her oxygenation. Given her past history  she may need to be started on anticoagulation therapy as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed  while we monitor her response to treatment and ensure that there are no complications. Her sedentary lifestyle  hyperlipidemia  hypertension  and history of hysterectomy and DVT make her predisposed to this condition  emphasizing the importance of preventive care and lifestyle modification. 
9,1,48,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial48,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged  Obese Female Patient: A Case Presentation  Demographic Information:  Patient: Mrs. Jane Doe Age: 56 Sex: Female Race: Caucasian    Current Presentation: The patient presents with sudden shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness. She reports experiencing chest pain that worsens when she takes a deep breath or coughs. Further inquiries reveal anxiety  palpitations  and a bloody cough over the last few hours.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Doe's medical history is significant for obesity  hypertension and sedentary lifestyle. She had a cholecystectomy 10 years ago  and she underwent total knee joint replacement surgery on both knees two months back  post which she has been immobile for most of the time. Classified as obese (BMI > 30)  she has not been engaged in physical activity for the last several years. She has been on blood pressure medication for the past 5 years. No known allergies or significant family history of genetic diseases have been reported. Mrs. Doe has a 20 pack-year smoking history up until 10 years ago but quit tobacco use after her cholecystectomy.   Summary: Given the recent surgery and prolonged immobilization  the past medical history of obesity and hypertension  the current symptoms seem consistent with an acute pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic tests including D-dimer  computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest  or a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. This patient's case underscores the importance of considering underlying risk factors and indicating early mobilization to reduce complications like pulmonary embolism following orthopedic surgeries.

Her vitals on arrival demonstrated tachypnea  tachycardia  and mild hypoxia. She is afebrile.  In terms of past medical history  Mrs. Doe was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension five years ago  both of which she manages with medication. She underwent surgery for an inguinal hernia a month ago and has been relatively immobile during her recovery period. She has a family history of deep vein thrombosis  with her mother having experienced multiple incidents.   In terms of medication use  Mrs. Doe takes Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and low-dose Aspirin as a preventive measure. She has no known drug allergies.   In combination with her post-operative immobility  her medical history  family history of thrombotic condition  and her presentation of symptoms  this could possibly indicate an acute pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic tests  including D-dimer  CT angiography  and V/Q scan  are required to confirm the diagnosis. After confirmation  appropriate management will be initiated which might include anticoagulation and possible thrombolysis.   It is essential that Mrs. Doe's condition is managed promptly due to the serious and potentially fatal repercussions of a pulmonary embolism. Regular follow-ups will be necessary to monitor her response to treatment and to prevent potential recurrence.
9,1,54,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial54,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Diabetic Patient  Introduction: We present a case of a 55-year-old African-American male who reported to the Emergency Department with symptoms of acute onset shortness of breath and chest discomfort. The patient is a known case of Diabetes Mellitus type II on Metformin therapy  diagnosed 10 years ago  but non-compliant to medication and diet control  and with poor glucose monitoring. He also has a history of long-term smoking  approximately a pack per day for 30 years  exacerbating his underlying risk of cardiovascular disease.  Clinical Presentation: The patient reported that he began feeling increasing discomfort in his chest  acute breathlessness with a sense of impending doom while changing his car tire. He was noticed to be in moderate to severe respiratory distress  clammy  and diaphoretic with increased respiratory rate. Additionally  the patient reported no hemoptysis  dizziness  or loss of consciousness.  Physical Examination and Investigation: Upon physical examination  the patient was found to have tachycardia and decreased breath sounds on the right side of the lung field with signs of right-sided heart failure. No signs of deep vein thrombosis were noticed in any extremities. Immediate electrocardiography revealed signs of right heart strain. A D-Dimer test was urgently performed which came back significantly positive.  Diagnosis and Management Plan: Considering the clinical symptoms  risk factors  and preliminary investigations  the patient was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism  possibly secondary to his poorly controlled diabetes and smoking habit leading to a pro-thrombotic state. The patient was immediately started on low molecular weight heparin  oxygen supplementation and intravenous fluids. Arrangement was done for a CT pulmonary angiogram to confirm the diagnosis and locate the site of the embolism. Concurrently  the hospital’s cardiology and endocrinology teams were consulted for the management of cogent conditions and optimizing his diabetes control.   Conclusion: This case illustrates the emergent presentation of a severe  potentially fatal condition  acute pulmonary embolism  stemming from the confluence of modifiable risk factors such as uncontrolled diabetes and smoking in a middle-aged man. The importance of prompt recognition  inducing rapid response and multi-disciplinary approach is highlighted in managing such acute cases.

9,1,65,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial65,Patient Presentation: We have Mr. John Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian male who is a retired truck driver. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he takes daily medication. He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  for which he underwent treatment five years ago. Currently  he is not on anticoagulation therapy.   Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain  which he describes as a sharp pain that intensifies with deep breaths.   History of Present Illness: The patient began to feel unwell three days ago with progressive dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. He denied any recent long-distance travel  surgery or immobilization. There were no reported lower limb pains or swellings. He has no known allergies.   He has been hypertensive for the past ten years  which is managed with medication; losartan 50 mg daily. He also has hypercholesterolemia which is managed with simvastatin 20 mg daily. He quit smoking ten years ago but has a past history of 40 pack years. He does not consume alcohol. He lives with his wife and leads a sedentary lifestyle post-retirement. He does not partake in any regular physical activity. Family history is significant for cardiovascular disease - his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 58.  Physical Examination: On examination  he appears anxious and diaphoretic with an elevated heart rate 120 beats/min  respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min  blood pressure 140/90 mmHg  and SpO2 of 92% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds at the right lung base. Heart sounds were tachycardic but no murmurs. The abdomen was soft  non-tender with no organomegaly. There was no calf tenderness or swelling.   Impression: Based on these findings  there is a high clinical suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism. Considering his previous DVT history  combined with his current symptoms of pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea  this condition must be ruled out immediately. Further diagnostic testing  including D-dimer  arterial blood gases  troponin  computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography should be performed  and treatment initiated as per guidelines. His sedentary lifestyle and history of DVT places him at significant risk for PE.
9,1,66,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial66,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 52-year-old African-American female who presents with acute respiratory distress and chest pain. Her symptoms started abruptly two days ago while at rest and have progressively worsened. The pain is sharp  localized to the central part of her chest and it intensifies with deep breathing. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath  fainting spells  and a recent episode of hemoptysis. She denies fever  cough or recent travel. She has not undergone any recent surgeries or trauma. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.  Past Medical History:  She has a notable past medical history of obesity (BMI 32) and hypertension for which she has been taking Amlodipine 5mg daily for the past 10 years.

Her paternal aunt had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the past but she denies any other significant family history of coagulopathies. Her last menstrual period was 20 years ago with surgical menopause due to hysterectomy for fibroids reports no use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy.  Weighing together the sudden onset of symptoms  her obesity  hypertension  diabetes  and a family history of DVT  this patient is at a high risk of pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation with a D-dimer test  CT pulmonary angiogram  and echocardiogram  if needed  are warranted to confirm the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism so that prompt intervention can be initiated.
9,1,67,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial67,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 52-year-old African American male by the name Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones is a manager at a local firm and lives with his wife and two kids. He has presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of difficulty in breathing and a sharp  stabbing chest pain that becomes worse with deep inhalation.  Past medical history:   According to the records available  Mr. Jones has been a diagnosed case of hypertension for the last eight years and type II diabetes mellitus for six years. He is also a known patient with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed three years ago and has been intermittently compliant with his prescribed anticoagulation treatment. Mr. Jones also has a 30-pack-year smoking history  but he quit smoking two years ago. He is relatively sedentary in terms of physical activity due to his desk job and is slightly overweight with a BMI of 28. There is also a history of familial cardiac diseases; his father passed away due to myocardial infarction at an early age.  Current Medications:  For his hypertension  Mr.Jones takes Lisinopril 10 mg daily and Amlodipine 5 mg daily. His diabetes is managed through twice-daily injections of 50/50 Humulin 25 units before breakfast and dinner and Metformin 1000 mg 2 times a day. To manage his DVT  he has been prescribed Warfarin dosed to maintain INR between 2-3 but he has been irregular with his clinic appointments and labs.  Allergic History:  Mr. Jones has an allergy to Penicillin  which causes him to have a rash.  Today's observation and provisional diagnosis:  Based on his symptoms of chest pain  sudden onset of shortness of breath alongside his personal history of DVT and intermittent anticoagulation  there is a strong suspicion that Mr. Jones is experiencing an Acute Pulmonary Embolism.  The patient has been stabilized and is currently undergoing further diagnostic procedures to confirm the diagnosis. Early indications from the EKG and D-dimer tests suggest probable pulmonary embolism. We intend to proceed with a CT pulmonary angiography for definitive diagnosis and thereafter will update the family members about his condition. Mr. Jones's condition  although serious  is managed in a timely manner.   His past issues with medical compliance indicate that thorough patient education may be needed to ensure adherence to future medical recommendations  particularly if long-term anticoagulation is deemed necessary.

9,1,70,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial70,Patient Presentation:  I am presenting Ms. Paula Jefferson  a 65-year-old Caucasian female who was brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The symptoms began while she was watching television at home  with no physical exertion involved. Upon arrival  the patient appeared anxious  had a rapid heart rate of 110 beats per minute  a blood pressure of 135/80 mmHg  and saturations of 88% on room air.  Ms. Jefferson's past medical history is significant for hypertension  for which she takes lisinopril  and obesity with a body mass index of 32. She does not have diabetes  coronary artery disease  or any known lung disease. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She worked as a flight attendant for 30 years  requiring her to be on her feet for long periods and to take frequent long-haul flights.   She underwent a total knee replacement surgery about two weeks ago and has been immobile since then. Her post-op recovery had been uneventful with no issues of wound infection. In terms of her family history  her father died of myocardial infarction at 72  and her mother died at 80 due to an unknown cause. She has no siblings.  The patient had no other symptoms such as fever  cough  hemoptysis  or leg swelling. Clinically and based on her recent immobility due to surgery  she is at high risk of developing venous thromboembolism. An immediate computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram was ordered and has confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Given that she is hemodynamically stable  without any contra-indications  she has been started on low molecular weight heparin for initial immediate anticoagulation  and oral anticoagulation has also been started.

Past Medical History:  John has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right leg that occurred five years ago. He has been taking warfarin since then. He also has a 10-year history of type II diabetes mellitus and has been on metformin. There is also a previous history of hypertension  managed with lisinopril  for the past 15 years. He had a myocardial infarction approximately eight years ago  which was managed medically.   Physical Examination:  On examination  John appeared anxious and distressed. His temperature was 98.6°F  pulse was 110 beats/minute  blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  respiratory rate was 22 breaths/minute and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Upon auscultation  breath sounds were reduced in the right lower lobe and he had a rapid heart rate.   Laboratory Parameters:  His blood glucose level was elevated (200 mg/dL)  likely secondary to his underlying diabetes. His INR (international normalized ratio) was subtherapeutic at 1.8. A D-dimer test was positive.  Imaging and Diagnostics:  A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) revealed a clot in the right pulmonary artery  confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.   Risk Factors:  John's risk factors for developing pulmonary embolism include his history of DVT  prolonged immobility due to his sedentary job  obesity (BMI of 30)  diabetes  and hypertension.  Treatment:  John was started on intravenous heparin for immediate anticoagulation.   Follow-up:  Given his history of DVT and now a PE  an outpatient appointment with a hematologist will be necessary for further evaluation of possible underlying thrombophilia. Long-term anticoagulation will be considered.  In conclusion  Mr. John Doe  a 58-year-old with a significant history of vascular conditions was diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism  likely resulting from his multiple risk factors. The patient recognises the need for lifestyle modifications to support his ongoing management.

9,1,80,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial80,Patient Presentation  I am here today to present Mr. John Simons  a 65-year-old Caucasian male who is exhibiting features of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). He was brought to the emergency department today morning with acute onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and a cough producing large amounts of blood-tinged sputum.   Regarding the patient's past medical history  he was diagnosed with hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus 15 years ago  which he has been managing with medication - Lisinopril for hypertension and Metformin for diabetes. This patient also reports a history of deep vein thrombosis three years ago for which he was treated with Warfarin for 6 months. Over the past few months  he has been leading a fairly sedentary lifestyle due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Mr. Simons is a former smoker  quitting 10 years ago  after a 30-year history of a pack per day habit.   On physical examination  he appears dyspneic with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. His blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg  heart rate is fast and irregular at 110 beats per minute  and his oxygen saturation on room air is 88% (Normal: >95% on room air). His physical examination is remarkable for decreased breath sounds and crackles in the right lung.   Given his sudden onset symptoms  his previous history of deep vein thrombosis  and his current physical findings  there is a high clinical suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism.   The initial diagnostic approach will include arterial blood gas test  chest X-ray  and ECG alongside the definitive diagnostic test - CT pulmonary Angiography. Following the diagnosis  the patient will require immediate anticoagulation therapy. His condition is treatable but serious  and rapid intervention is needed to protect against potentially fatal complications. 
9,1,81,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial81,Patient Presentation:  Today we will be discussing Mr. John Roberts  a 67-year-old Caucasian male who presents with an acute pulmonary embolism. He was brought to the emergency department today by his wife  who noticed him gasping for breath and appearing increasingly disoriented.  His main complaints are experiencing sudden shortness of breath  chest pain which worsens with deep breaths  and a feeling of lightheadedness. He reports a sudden onset of symptoms which has progressively worsened over the course of two hours.  Mr. Roberts is a former smoker having quit a decade ago after smoking one pack a day for about 30 years. He has a remarkable past medical history  including type II diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia which is being managed with Metformin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin respectively. He had a myocardial infarction (MI) 5 years ago but seems to have good compliance with his medications and lifestyle changes since then.   He has a surgical history of right total hip arthroplasty due to severe osteoarthritis one month back. He reports good functional status prior to this event. There is no known family history of thrombotic or clotting disorders but his father died at a young age from a myocardial infarction.  He denies alcohol or recreational drug use but acknowledges sedentary lifestyle due to recent surgery and long-term desk job.  Given these symptoms  his recent surgery  and his existing risk factors  he has been diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism. He has been started on anticoagulant therapy in the emergency department  and the interventional radiology team have been alerted for possible thrombolytic therapy.
9,1,82,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial82,Slide 1: Introduction  Today  we will discuss the case of a patient with Acute Pulmonary Embolism. This condition involves a clot or obstruction in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lung  a serious condition that can cause heart damage or death.   Slide 2: Patient Presentation   Our patient is a 65-year-old  Caucasian male named John. He presented with sudden shortness of breath  chest pain  and a bloody cough. He also reported recent leg swelling and pain. A sudden onset of these symptoms often characterizes Acute Pulmonary Embolism.   Slide 3: Demographics and Lifestyle   John is a retired engineer  living in the suburbs and is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago. He is a social drinker and is physically inactive for most of the day  which can pose a risk for PE due to long periods of immobility.   Slide 4: Past Medical History   John has a history of chronic hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which are under control with medication. However  John had undergone a total hip replacement surgery two months ago.  Slide 5: Risk Factors   Risk factors that may have contributed to the development of John's condition include:  - Advanced age - Surgery: His recent hip replacement puts him at heightened risk for clots  specifically deep vein thrombosis  which can travel to the lungs and cause PE. - Sedentary lifestyle - Chronic hypertension  - History of smoking  even though he quit years ago - Obesity  Slide 6: Conclusion   Given the patient's symptoms and medical history  we have established that the sudden onset of chest pain  shortness of breath and a bloody cough are likely caused by acute pulmonary embolism. Appropriate diagnostic tests and timely treatment are crucial in managing the condition and increasing survival rates.
9,1,83,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial83,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the emergency department with a sudden onset of sharp chest pain  shortness of breath  and cough. The patient mentioned that he has been relatively immobile for the past two weeks due to a recent knee replacement surgery. The pain started approximately 30 minutes prior to presentation and has been constant  with no alleviation or exacerbation factors. Associated symptoms include mild dizziness and faintness.   He does not have any known allergies. He has a past medical history of hypertension  for which he takes daily medication. He had undergone right knee replacement surgery two weeks ago. There are no reports of a similar event in the past.  The patient's family history is notable for his father  who died of a stroke at age 75; his mother  who is alive and has been diagnosed with hypertension.  He is a former smoker  having quit 5 years ago. There is no history of illicit drug use or excess alcohol consumption. The patient currently lives with his wife and has been adhering to the rehabilitation program given post-knee surgery.  In conclusion  based on the clinical presentation  the sudden onset of symptoms along with a history of recent surgery and immobility  the diagnostic suspicion is strongly oriented towards an acute pulmonary embolism. Further examination and investigation are needed to confirm this diagnosis and to assess the patient's overall clinical status.
9,1,84,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial84,Patient Presentation:   Demographics:  Mr. A is a 56-year-old Caucasian male who presents with an acute onset of shortness of breath.  Past Medical History:  He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he takes atenolol and atorvastatin respectively. The patient is a former smoker with a 20 pack-year history but quit smoking five years back. He does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He used to be physically active until his recent hip replacement surgery about a month ago  after which he has been fairly sedentary. Mr. A has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father dying at the age of 62 from a heart attack.  Present Complaint:   Mr. A reports that the shortness of breath started abruptly today while resting at home. He describes it as feeling like he can’t get enough air. Associated symptoms include a dull  vague chest pain  dry cough  light-headedness  and leg swelling. He denied any nausea  changes in consciousness  or diaphoresis. He has no known allergies and is currently not on any other medications apart from his regular ones.  Assessment:   Upon physical examination  Mr. A’s vital signs revealed tachycardia and tachypnea with low oxygen saturation levels on room air. His blood pressure was within normal limits and he was afebrile. His lower extremities showed pitting edema  particularly on the right side which was operated on.  Based on his recent history of surgery  prolonged period of inactivity  the presence of risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  age  and family history of cardiovascular disease  differential diagnosis will consider an acute pulmonary embolism. Diagnostic tests such as D-dimer  computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)  and Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities will be requested to confirm the diagnosis.   If the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is confirmed  treatment will include therapeutic anticoagulation such as low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)  direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)  or warfarin depending on the severity and the risk of bleeding. The patient would also receive supplemental oxygen  and management of the leg swelling may involve compression stockings. Regular follow up would also be necessary to monitor the efficacy and side effects of the treatment.
9,1,85,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial85,Presentation of Patient with Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Demographics: The patient is a 65-year-old African American female named Mrs. Sarah Jefferson who resides at 245 Springhill Drive  Los Angeles. She is retired and a widower with two adult children residing out of state. Her primary language is English  and she has a moderate level of education  having obtained a bachelor's degree. She is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol socially.  Medical History: Mrs. Jefferson has a significant past medical history including hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes  both of which have been controlled by medication for the past 15 years. She also has a three-year history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  and receives regular inhaler therapy for this. Her mother died from a stroke and her father from a heart attack.  Current Presentation: On the morning of 20th June  2022  Mrs. Jefferson presented to the ER with acute onset of chest pain  shortness of breath and light-headedness. The pain was sudden  stabbing in nature  localized at the center of the chest and radiating to the left arm. It worsened with deep breaths  and was accompanied by a sense of impending doom. The patient reported a constant 7/10 pain which lasted for approximately a few hours prior to her arrival at the ER.  Additional Remarks: Records also indicate that Mrs. Jefferson had a recent trip that required prolonged sitting (a 12-hour flight to visit her son in Australia) and her mobility at home has been limited due to a sprained ankle  thereby increasing her risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  a common source of pulmonary embolism. Also  the patient's family history of cardiovascular diseases  her hypertension and diabetes  in combination with her current symptoms  strongly suggest a critical thromboembolic event such as acute pulmonary embolism. A CT angiography has been ordered to confirm the diagnosis.                                         
9,1,86,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial86,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Geoffrey Sanders  a 56-year-old African American male  presented to our emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain and cough with bloody sputum. He was traveling alone and there are no immediate family members available for collateral information.  He has a known history of hypertension  for which he is on amlodipine  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is well-controlled on metformin. He also suffered from a left calf deep vein thrombosis (DVT) two years ago and has a 15-year history of smoking. Patient was taken off anticoagulation after six months of his DVT diagnosis. He has no history of any surgeries. He is currently a real estate agent and denies any recent extended periods of travel or immobility.  On arrival  the patient is in obvious distress. He is tachycardic (Heart rate - 110 bpm) and tachypneic (Respiratory rate - 22 breaths per min)  with oxygen saturation of 90% on room air  temperature of 37°C  and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. He has no allergies and there is no family history of blood clots or malignancy.  A diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is highly suspected given his symptoms and history. Further confirmatory imaging and lab tests  including D-Dimer  CT pulmonary angiography  chest x-ray  arterial blood gas  and ECG  have been ordered.   In terms of immediate management  the patient has been started on Oxygen therapy and parenteral anticoagulation pending the result of these investigations. Early mobilization will be planned as a long-term strategy  in addition to lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation  and eventual transition to oral anticoagulation  most likely a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC)  unless contraindicated.  His hypertension and diabetes will also continue to be managed appropriately. He will need close monitoring for the development of any complications and to assess for any conditions that may have predisposed him to this event.  Follow-up with a hematologist may also be considered to rule out any underlying thrombophilia state.
9,1,87,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial87,Presentation Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Clinical Case Study   Patient Overview:  We are discussing the case of Mr. Jenkins  a 56-year-old African-American male patient who presents with symptoms of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE). He is currently employed as a truck driver  a lifestyle which involves long periods of immobility. He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol socially.   Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Jenkins enters the clinic complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and palpitations that started approximately two hours ago. The pain is noted to be pleuritic in nature  worsening with deep breaths. He also reports a feeling of light-headedness but denies any loss of consciousness  cough  or hemoptysis.   Past Medical History: Upon review of his medical history  Mr. Jenkins was diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago and is currently under medication (amlodipine 5mg daily). However  his compliance to medication is inconsistent due to his job demands. He hasn't had any previous incidences of similar symptoms and his surgical history is unremarkable. His father had a history of deep vein thrombosis and there is a family history of Factor V Leiden  thus raising suspicion for a genetic predisposition to thromboembolic events.  Vitals at Presentation: On examination  he is anxious  pale  and diaphoretic. His vitals reveal tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min  tachycardia with heart rate 110 bpm  blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  an oxygen saturation at 88% on room air  and temperature is normal at 37.1°C (98.8°F).  Summary: We are led to suspect Acute Pulmonary Embolism in Mr. Jenkins due to sudden onset dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  tachycardia  tachypnea and family history of thromboembolic events. Today we'll discuss the diagnostic approach and management strategies as we aim to confirm the diagnosis and treat this potential APE effectively.

Demographics: He lives in a suburban environment with his wife  is a retired bank manager  and maintains a sedentary lifestyle. He neither smokes nor consumes alcohol. No known drug allergies reported by the patient.  Past Medical History: He has a history of hypertension and type-II diabetes mellitus  both adequately controlled on medication: Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension and Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes. His family history is significant with a father dying of a stroke at 67 and mother suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. No history of pulmonary disease in the first degree family history.  Present Complaint: Over the last 24 hours  the patient has experienced sudden onset chest pain that has worsened with deep breaths  along with a persistent shortness of breath. The pains are severe  stabbing in nature and central in location. No exacerbating or relieving factors were identified by the patient. He also recalls feeling light-headed and having episodes of cold sweats. However  he denies any cough  hemoptysis  or recent sick contacts.  Recent Events: The patient had a total knee replacement surgery 10 days ago due to advancing osteoarthritis.   Physical Examination:  Upon examination  the patient was found to be anxious and noticeably dyspneic. Vital signs were as follows: BP – 135/85 mmHg  HR - 110/minute  RR - 22/minute  Temp – 98.6 F  SpO2 - 90% on room air. Auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds in the lower right lung field. His cardiovascular  abdominal  neurological examinations were unremarkable  and post-operative knee surgical wound was healing well.  Impression: Considering the patient's recent surgical history  his sedentary lifestyle  and the sudden onset of his symptoms  an acute pulmonary embolism is highly suspected.  Further Investigation: Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and D-Dimer tests are planned for the confirmation of the acute pulmonary embolism. Concurrently  venous Doppler ultrasonography for deep vein thrombosis detection will be performed given his recent surgery. The patient needs close monitoring and should anticoagulation be confirmed necessary  it should be started as soon as possible.
9,1,89,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial89,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Johnson is a 60-year-old African-American male who presents to the emergency department of our health facility. He presents with a six-hour history of sudden-onset severe chest pain. The chest pain is centrally located  constant and depends on his breathing. He also states associated symptoms such as sudden onset of shortness of breath or dyspnea  cough  and mild hemoptysis. He also describes dizziness and episodes of fainting spells.   He denies fever  but reports subjective sense of chills and sweating. He also denies recent travel  surgeries or prolonged periods of immobility. He has no known drug allergies.  Demographic Information:  Mr. Johnson lives with his wife and one of their children in a nearby suburb. He is a retired civil engineer and his family history reveals his father experienced a similar episode in his late sixties. He is an ex-smoker with a history of high blood pressure and type II diabetes mellitus. He drinks alcohol only during festivities.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has been managing his hypertension and diabetes for the last 14 years. He was diagnosed with both conditions during his yearly check-up at the age of 46. Since then  he has been on a regimen of 1 tablet of amlodipine 5mg daily for BP and 1 tablet of metformin 500mg twice daily for his blood sugar. His last completely normal check-up was about three months ago.   Given his symptoms of chest pain  shortness of breath  and history of hypertension and diabetes  he was evaluated for a possible cardiac event. However  despite the signs and symptoms suggesting a myocardial infarction  an acute pulmonary embolism was considered due to sudden onset  its dependence on his respiration and the presence of hemoptysis. More precise assessments  which are recommended  should include D-dimer test  Computed Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA)  or a ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan to confirm the diagnosis.   In conclusion  Mr. Johnson represents a classic case of possible acute pulmonary embolism and further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Immediate measures will be taken to prevent further clotting and steps to dissolve the current clot are needed to limit damage to the lungs.
9,1,90,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial90,Patient Presentation:  We have a 62-year-old Caucasian female  Mrs. Susan Bloom  who has presented to the emergency department with symptoms consistent with an acute pulmonary embolism. She has a BMI of 28  indicating that she's overweight  and she's a non-smoker.  Mrs. Bloom visited complaining of sudden onset of chest pain  shortness of breath  and light-headedness for the few past hours. On assessment  her vitals were: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg  pulse rate 110 bpm  respiration rate 25/min  oxygen saturation 92% on room air.   The patient has a significant past medical history. She is known to have systemic hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which have been under moderate control with her medications. She reports good compliance with her antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs.   Six weeks ago  Mrs. Bloom underwent a total hip arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis. She was anticoagulated at that time but the anticoagulation was stopped one week after the surgery. The typical risks associated with a recent surgical procedure  inactivity and her symptomology all suggest that an acute pulmonary embolism should be considered.  Her family history is also notable. Her father had coronary artery disease and her mother had a stroke. This adds up to her risk of having a thromboembolic disease. Her social history features living alone  being retired and having limited mobility due to the recent surgery.  Immediate diagnostic tests have been ordered  including D-dimer  CT Pulmonary Angiogram and ECG.   That is our current standing with Mrs. Bloom. We are initiating treatment immediately given the strong suspicion of an acute pulmonary embolism. With her age  recent surgical history  limited mobility  and her symptomatic presentation  she's a high-risk patient and we are getting the results of the ordered labs and tests to confirm diagnosis and treatment plans.
9,1,91,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial91,Title: A Case Presentation on Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old male named Mr. Stuart reporting recent onset of shortness of breath and acute chest pain that is exacerbated with deep respirations  suggesting pleuritic chest pain. The patient also reports feeling light-headed but has not experienced any episodes of syncope. He has a history of long plane travel having recently returned from an international flight a week prior. His body mass index is 28 indicating overweight. He is a former smoker and reports moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: Mr. Stuart has been previously diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. He is on Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and takes daily low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis. He does not have any prior history of surgery or prolonged immobilization. He also does not report any previous clot-related issues either personally or in his family history.   Current Presentation: On arrival  the patient appears anxious and diaphoretic with reported symptoms of severe acute chest pain and shortness of breath. On examination  he has an increased heart rate (tachycardia) around 105 beats per minute and slightly increased blood pressure (140/90 mmHg). Oxygen saturation is low at 92% on room air. There are no abnormal signs identified on lung auscultation and abdominal exam is normal.   Preliminary Diagnosis: Given the patient's report of recent long-distance travel  sudden onset of symptoms  and the nature of his presenting symptoms  our preliminary diagnosis is an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This diagnosis will be confirmed with further investigations including a D-dimer test  followed by imaging tests like a CT Pulmonary angiography if needed. Meanwhile  the patient should be started on empirical treatment for PE considering the risk vs benefit favoring treatment.
9,1,92,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial92,Patient Presentation:  We have a 65-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. J.M  who presents with sudden onset dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  and light-headedness.   Past Medical History:  Mr. J.M has been under treatment for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the last 10 years. He is overweight  with a BMI of 28  and has a 40 pack-year smoking history. His mother had a history of a deep vein thrombosis. The patient does not report any history of surgery or trauma recently but does mention that he recently had a long-haul flight about a week ago.  Medications:  Mr. J.M's pharmaceutical regime includes Lisinopril 10mg Daily for his hypertension and Atorvastatin 20mg Daily for hyperlipidemia. He is also taking low dose Aspirin as per cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines. Mr. J.M is compliant with his medications and does not report any known allergies.  Clinical Exam:  On inspection  the patient is in acute distress  appearing anxious and slightly cyanotic. The patient's BP is 130/80 mmHg  Pulse 110 bpm with an irregular rhythm  and respiratory rate is 24 breaths/minute. His temperature is within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. A pulmonary exam reveals tachypnea and decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe. Heart sounds are tachycardic with no murmurs. His extremities are warm. There is mild ankle edema  and his calves are symmetrical with mild tenderness on the right side.  Plan:  The clinical presentation combined with this patient's risk factors creates a high suspicion for a possible Acute Pulmonary Embolism. The plan is to get a D-dimer  Troponin  ABG  Chest X-ray  and ECG as these initial investigations. The patient should be placed on supplemental oxygen immediately to decrease his hypoxia. The primary treatment plan for now includes anticoagulation therapy. Depending on the severity of his condition and initial test results  further imaging tests like CT Scan  V/Q Scan  or Pulmonary Angiography may be required.   This is a time-sensitive critical situation. Patient safety and comfort are prioritized  ensuring all necessary steps are promptly taken to confirm the diagnosis and start appropriate management.
9,1,93,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial93,Title: Acute Pulinary Embolism Case Presentation  Introduction: Our patient is a 63-year-old African American female  known as Patient X  who presents with symptoms suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism.  Demographics: Patient X is known to be a non-smoker  living in an urban setting in Atlanta  Georgia. She is a retired school teacher  and she lives alone. She does not consume alcohol and has no known drug allergies. Her body mass index is within the normal range  suggesting she is not obese.  Past Medical History: Patient X has a significant past medical history of hypertension  controlled adequately with Lisinopril 10mg daily. She was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus about five years ago. Her glycemic control has been well-managed with metformin 500mg twice daily. For her hyperlipidemia  she is on simvastatin 10mg daily at night. She underwent total knee replacement surgery on her right knee about three months ago.  Presenting Complaint and History of Present Illness: Patient X presents with sudden onset shortness of breath which started two hours prior to presentation. The shortness of breath is associated with mild chest pain described as 'tightness' in the center of her chest. She also has a productive cough with white sputum but denies any hemoptysis. There is no history of recent trauma or infection. She reports low-grade fevers but no chills.  Physical Examination:  The patient appeared comfortable at rest but evidencing respiratory distress upon minimal exertion. Vital signs were Blood Pressure 140/90 mmHg  Pulse 105 bpm  Respiratory Rate 22 breaths per minute  Temperature 98.6°F and Oxygen Saturation 92% on room air. No cyanosis or jaundice was noted. Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia with regular rhythm and no audible murmurs. Respiratory examination indicated diminished breath sounds over the right lower lung field.  Conclusion:  Given her recent history of major surgery (total knee replacement)  the acute onset of her symptoms  and the physical examination findings suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism  it was deemed necessary to initiate measures for immediate management while confirming the diagnosis with further investigations.
9,1,94,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial94,Subject: Mrs. Anita Thompson  a 72-year-old caucasian female  Residential Status : Lives alone in a two-story home  in the suburban part of the town. Moderate accessibility to medical facilities.  Presenting Vital Information: Unstable vital signs upon admission. Blood pressure: 148/90 mmHg  Heart rate: 115 beats per minute  Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute  Oxygen saturation: 84% on room air.  Chief Complaint: Mrs. Thompson presented to the ER with a sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness that developed over a few hours.  Medical History: Mrs. Thompson has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which she is on medication. She was also diagnosed with atrial fibrillation 5 years ago. Recently  she underwent a total hip replacement surgery on the right side 6 weeks ago. Regarding her lifestyle  she was a smoker with a 30 pack-year history but has been abstinent for the last 10 years. She drinks alcohol occasionally and denies any illicit drug use.  Family History: She has a family history of cardiovascular diseases with her father passing away from a myocardial infarction and her sister having a stroke.  Social History: She is a retired school teacher  a widow with 3 children who live interstate. She has a small circle of friends but remains socially active within her community.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  she appeared anxious  sweaty  and dyspneic at rest. Cardiac auscultation revealed tachycardia and an irregular rhythm consistent with her history of atrial fibrillation. Lung auscultation was notable for decreased breath sounds in the lower right lung field. She had mild pedal edema on the right side.  Diagnosis: Based on the patient's recent surgical history  symptoms  and physical examination  an initial diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is suspected. Emergent investigations including D-dimer assay  contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest or V/Q scan are in order to confirm the diagnosis.  Plan: Mrs. Thompson was started on high-flow oxygen via non-rebreather mask and will be closely monitored in intensive care. Anticoagulation therapy will be initiated once the diagnosis is confirmed. Further management decisions will be based on the patient's hemodynamic stability and result of diagnostic tests. 
9,1,95,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial95,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Male Patient with Hypertension and Obesity  Patient Profile: Mr. John Harris  a 58-year-old Caucasian male  is presenting with acute respiratory symptoms indicative of a possible pulmonary embolism. He was born and raised in Chicago  Illinois  has worked as a bank manager for over 30 years and has been leading a sedentary lifestyle for the past few years. He reports non-compliance to a balanced diet and physical activity  admitting to consume fast food more often.  Medical History: Mr. Harris has a registered history of systemic hypertension for the last 15 years  maintained on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. He was diagnosed as obese (BMI 31.5) during a routine health examination 5 years ago but did not take significant measurements to control it barring a brief period of dietary regulations. He denies any history of smoking  alcohol consumption  diabetes  or hyperlipidemia. His family history is significant  with his father  who had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60 and maternal uncle who had a stroke in his late 50s. There is no known history of hematological disorders in his family.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Harris came to the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of shortness of breath  sharp chest pain  feeling faint and an episode of blood-tinged sputum  lasted for 2-3 hours. The symptoms reportedly started while he was at rest  watching television. The symptoms are not alleviated upon rest or change in position.   Physical Examination: On examination  he showed signs of distress  tachypnea (24 breaths/min)  and increased pulse rate (110 beats/min). His blood pressure measured 140/95 mmHg  a bit heightened  and oxygen saturation was 92%. Lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the lower left lung field. No noticeable leg swelling or signs of deep vein thrombosis were observed.  Preliminary Diagnosis: The patient's medical history  his risk factors including sedentary lifestyle  obesity  hypertension  and the current clinical symptoms like sudden onset of dyspnea  chest pain  tachycardia  hypertension  and hemoptysis primarily suggest the presence of an Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE).   Further Evaluations: Immediate investigations including D-dimer test  chest X-Ray  and Computed Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) are recommended for confirmation. Upon confirmation  Mr. Harris would likely require anticoagulation therapy and lifestyle modifications to manage his condition and reduce the risk of future events.
9,1,96,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial96,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Geriatric Patient  Presenting Patient:   Mr. Thompson  a 75-year-old African American male  presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain is pleuritic in nature and gets worse on deep inspiration.  Demographics:  Mr. Thompson is a retired teacher living in the urban area of Philadelphia. He is widowed and lives with his older son. He has a history of moderate alcohol use but quit smoking 10 years ago.   Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a significant medical history that includes hypertension (HTN)  type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)  and was hospitalized for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) three years ago. His diabetes and HTN are well-controlled with metformin and losartan respectively. He also takes tamsulosin for his BPH condition. He does not report any allergies.  Clinical Picture: Upon examination  the patient appears to be in moderate respiratory distress. His body mass index (BMI) is 28  indicating overweight. Vital signs reported are: Blood Pressure 150/90 mmHg  Pulse rate 110 per minute  Respiratory rate 28 per minute  Oxygen saturation 90% on room air  and Temperature 98.6F. Electrocardiogram (EKG) shows signs of right ventricular strain and labs reveal slightly elevated troponin levels. D-dimer levels came back as well-above normal which raises suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism.  These clinical features paired with his history of DVT increase the probability of an acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  which can pose as immediate threat to his life. The patient was immediately put on non-invasive ventilation and started on therapeutic doses of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH). The team has ordered a Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) to confirm the diagnosis.   In light of this  Mr. Thompson's treatment plan will be further adjusted based on image findings and his response to initial pharmacological intervention. His son has been notified of his condition and the potential next steps and the team awaits the CTPA results to confirm diagnosis and devise the specific management plan.
9,1,97,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial97,Subject: Presentation of a patient with acute pulmonary embolism  Patient Information: The patient is a 57-year-old Caucasian male named Jack Thompson. He is height 5’10”  weighs 220 pounds  and is a construction worker by profession. He lives with his wife and has no children. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history and reports a sedentary lifestyle. There is no family history of genetic disorders.   Past Medical History: The patient has previously been diagnosed with high blood pressure (hypertension) and type 2 Diabetes. These conditions have been managed with prescribed medications (Lisinopril 10mg/day and Metformin 500mg twice a day  respectively) and a recommended diet. He had a right knee replacement two months ago. His medical records also show a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed eight years ago which was treated with anticoagulation therapy.   Presenting Complaint: The patient was brought into the ER with sudden onset difficulty in breathing  chest pain that got worse with deep breathing and a sensation of 'racing heart'. He also reported feeling light-headed.  On physical examination  the patient was in acute distress with an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and increased rate of respiration (tachypnea). His blood pressure was slightly elevated (140/90 mmHg).   Based on his symptoms  medical history and physical examination  the patient was diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism.  In conclusion  considering the patient's past medical history and his recent surgery  the likeliness of pulmonary embolism increases. Regular follow-ups  medication adherence  lifestyle modifications and regular physical therapy post-surgery  could have been the possible deterrents for this condition. However  the immediate need is to stabilize the patient and treat the embolism aggressively. Regular counselling regarding the importance of follow-ups and medication adherence will be part of the patient's hospital course. It will be recommended for the patient to undergo a genetic counselling to rule out any genetic propensity towards clot formations.
9,1,98,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial98,Patient Presentation  Mr. James Alberts is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  who was brought into the Emergency Department with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain that worsens with deep breathing  and a low-grade fever for the past 24 hours. James lives with his wife in their suburban home in the heart of Miami. He has been a lifetime smoker  averaging about a pack per day and has a sedentary lifestyle – since retiring from his accounting job 5 years ago. He also reported recently traveling on a long-haul flight  which lasted for more than 8 hours.  Mr. James’s current medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he is on hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin  respectively. He was also diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 10 years ago and manages it with metformin and a controlled diet. Additionally  he underwent a total knee replacement surgery a month ago and was on bed rest for several days after the procedure.   His family history is also significant. His mother died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 72  and his younger sister was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. No known genetic disorders have been documented in the family. He has no known drug allergies but he is a self-reported heavy drinker.  Physical examination showed tachypnea  tachycardia  and slightly decreased oxygen saturation on room air. Blood pressure and body mass index are within normal range for his age and gender. Lungs were clear bilaterally on auscultation but with decreased breath sounds on the right lower lobe.  The patient's history of recent orthopedic surgery  along with his pronged immobilization  lifestyle choices  and presenting symptoms highly suggest an acute pulmonary embolism. Immediate intervention and further diagnostic testing have been recommended.
9,1,99,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial99,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  has presented himself at our hospital's Emergency Department. He appears to be in visible distress  and anxious due to his current health condition.  Patient Complaints:  Mr. Doe reports sudden onset shortness of breath and intermittent chest pain for the past several hours. He ranks the pain's intensity at 7 of 10 and describes it as a sharp  sudden discomfort felt most intensely when he tries to breathe deeply or coughs.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a documented history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  for which he has been on oral anticoagulation therapy in the past. He also has been diagnosed with hypertension and Type II diabetes  both of which have been relatively well managed with medication. Mr. Doe's father had a history of pulmonary embolism and his mother had a history of stroke.   Social History:  Mr. Doe has a 30-pack year history of smoking and quit approximately 10 years ago. He consumes alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use. He lives with his wife and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to his retirement.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  the patient is anxious  tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg  and oxygen saturation of 92 percent on room air. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds at the left lower lobe. Cardiac examination is regular without murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Lower extremity examination shows no obvious signs of DVT such as swelling or redness.  Based on the medical history  current symptoms  and physical examination  the foremost clinical suspicion is of an acute pulmonary embolism that needs immediate action. Further tests like D-dimer  chest imaging (CT pulmonary angiogram)  and possibly echocardiogram for right ventricular strain would be imminent. Treatment will likely involve anticoagulation and possibly thrombolysis  depending on the severity of the embolism.
9,1,100,diagnosis9-prompt1-trial100,Patient Presentation:  We are discussing Mr. John Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian male who presents with acute onset of chest pain  shortness of breath  and cough productive of blood-tinged sputum. He is a retired mechanical engineer and resides in Los Angeles  California  with his wife. He enjoys golfing during his spare time  but his physical activity has been significantly reduced these past few months due to his symptoms. Mr. Smith is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago after a pack-a-day habit for approximately 30 years. He denies alcohol or drug usage.  Mr. Smith has a significant past medical history including hypertension controlled with lisinopril and amlodipine  type 2 diabetes managed with metformin  hypercholesterolemia managed with simvastatin  a previous myocardial infarction five years ago with successful angioplasty and stent placement  and a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a hip replacement surgery two years ago. In addition to the aforementioned medications  he takes aspirin 81 mg daily and has been on chronic warfarin therapy since his DVT.   Recently  Mr. Smith had a prolonged plane trip (approximately 10 hours) two weeks ago  following which he noticed swelling in his right calf  which has now subsided. Yesterday  he started experiencing sudden  sharp chest pain and dyspnea which got worse on deep inspiration. The sputum became bloody this morning  prompting his visit to the emergency room.   Upon initial evaluation  his vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg  a heart rate of 110 bpm  an oxygen saturation of 89% on room air  and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. His physical examination is notable for tachypnea  right-sided lower lobe inspiratory crackles on chest auscultation and a swollen  tender right leg.  The presentation is consistent with acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  perhaps secondary to DVT. Further clarification will be obtained from a d-dimer test  lower extremity venous doppler ultrasonography  and CT-pulmonary angiogram as per protocol. Immediate management with anticoagulants has been initiated based on the clinical suspicion of PE.

9,3,1,diagnosis9-prompt3-trial1,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-aged Female Patient  Slide 1: Introduction Today  we will walk through a case involving an acute pulmonary embolism. Our patient is a middle-aged woman who presented with several concerning symptoms.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is Mrs. Johnson  a 52-year-old Caucasian woman. She is a homemaker  nonsmoker  and rarely consumes alcohol. Mrs. Johnson has a body mass index (BMI) of 28  reflecting a mildly obese status. She resides in an urban location with her husband and has three adult children.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mrs. Johnson was diagnosed with high blood pressure eight years ago but has managed it effectively with medication. She was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes two years ago  which she's been monitoring and controlling with oral antidiabetic drugs. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after her last childbirth 20 years ago. Furthermore  she has a sedentary lifestyle and a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms  Mrs. Johnson visited the emergency room complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath  a sharp  localized chest pain that worsens with deep breaths  and mild bouts of unexplained coughing - occasionally with blood. Moreover  she reported experiencing episodes of fainting and mild swelling in her left leg.  Slide 5: Suspected Diagnosis and Reasons  Given her past medical history of DVT  current complaints  and predisposing factors (such as her sedentary lifestyle and history of hypertension and diabetes)  the symptoms strongly suggest an acute pulmonary embolism.  Slide 6: Tests and Diagnoses The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is often confirmed with imaging tests. These may include Computerized tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or a ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan. D-dimer blood tests and ultrasound of the legs can further assist in diagnosing.  Slide 7: Conclusion  In conclusion  acute pulmonary embolism is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition. This case exemplifies how pre-existing health problems  lifestyle factors  and genetic predispositions can increase the risk. Early recognition and management of symptoms can significantly improve patient outcomes.

9,3,6,diagnosis9-prompt3-trial6,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Clinical Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction Here we discuss the case of a patient who presented with acute pulmonary embolism. Our aim is to review the etiology  movement  and management of pulmonary embolism.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 58-year-old African American male  with a desk job and a smoking history of 30 pack-years.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a history of hypertension and obesity. BMI is 31. He was diagnosed with left lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 4 years ago  successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy. Patient's compliance with hypertension and anti-smoking medication is inconsistent.  Slide 4: Current Presentation The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. Upon physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. His vital parameters indicated tachycardia and tachypnea. He had bloody sputum  but no wheezing or leg swelling was observed.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Evaluation A CT pulmonary angiography confirmed the presence of a clot in the left pulmonary artery. Lab results showed elevated D-dimer level and mild troponin elevation. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern indicative of acute pulmonary embolism. Ultrasound of the legs revealed a fresh clot in the left popliteal vein suggestive of DVT recurrence.  Slide 6: Management and Treatment The patient was started on a heparin drip and later transitioned to oral anticoagulant therapy. Oxygen support was provided to correct hypoxia. He was educated about the importance of medication adherence  lifestyle modifications which include smoking cessation  weight management  and periodic follow-ups.  Slide 7: Follow-Up and Prognosis Follow-up recommendations include regular outpatient visits for monitoring blood coagulation parameters  echocardiogram assessments  leg ultrasounds  and ongoing support for smoking cessation. The patient's prognosis is guarded  given the history of past non-compliance  but with consistent treatment and lifestyle changes  significant improvements can be expected.   Slide 8: Conclusion This case reinforces the importance of considering Pulmonary Embolism in patients with a history of DVT presenting with chest symptoms. We were reminded of the significant impacts of lifestyle factors  particularly smoking and weight management  on disease presentation and progression.

9,3,49,diagnosis9-prompt3-trial49,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in Middle-Aged Female Patient  Demographics and Past Medical History:  Patient Information: - Name: 'Patient X' - Gender: Female - Age: 45 years old - Occupation: CPA at a local firm - Marital Status: Married  two children  Relevant Past Medical History: - Mild Hypertension: Diagnosed ten years ago  currently stable with medication. - Smoking History: Active smoker for the past 20 years  approximately one pack a day. - Obesity: BMI of 32. Continual management with lifestyle and dietary modifications.  Case presentation:  Chief Complaint: The patient came to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain that had begun a few hours earlier.   Physical Examination: On examination  the patient was anxious but fully alert. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure = 130/70 mmHg; heart rate = 110 beats/min; respiratory rate = 26 breaths/min  oxygen saturation = 90% on room air.  Diagnostic Evaluation: An ECG showed sinus tachycardia but was otherwise nonspecific. Chest X-rays were clear with no sign of infection or other diseases. CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. D-dimer levels were significantly elevated.   Clinical Course: The patient was immediately anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin. A vena cava filter was placed considering her risk factors.  Discussion: This case represents a typical presentation of acute pulmonary embolism  a condition characterized by the blockage of pulmonary arteries  often by thrombi. Risk factors for PE include old age  obesity  surgery  prolonged immobilization  malignancy  smoking  etc. In this case  smoking and obesity could be identified as two primary risk factors.  It is essential to educate such patients about their potential risk factors in developing clot conditions like PE. Patient 'X' should be advised to quit smoking and pursue weight loss and healthier lifestyles as preventive measures further. Pulmonary embolism is a potentially life-threatening condition  but with proper medical management and health education  the prognosis can significantly improve.   The prompt recognition and treatment in this case allowed effective care and is a reminder of the serious nature of pulmonary embolism. Accordingly  it is vital to have a high suspicion of PE  especially in patients with risk factors and presenting with sudden chest pain  dyspnea  or unexplained hypoxia.

Middle-age and elderly individuals are more at risk  along with those who have undergone recent surgery  are on birth control or hormone therapy  smoke or are overweight.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our subject  Mr. Smith  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a history of extended immobility due to a recent total knee replacement surgery. He is a retired professional and a current smoker with a body mass index within the overweight range.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Smith has a significant past medical history  including Type II Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension  and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). He has been on Metformin for his diabetes and was prescribed blood thinners post his orthopaedic surgery to prevent thrombosis. Mr. Smith was compliant with his medications but was unable to keep up with his recommended physical activities due to recovery from surgery.  Slide 4: Presentation and Symptoms Mr. Smith presented to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness. He reported the chest pain as sharp and increasing with deep breaths. Additionally  he had a cough with occasional hemoptysis.  Slide 5: Diagnosis Based on the presenting symptoms and his recent surgery  a provisional diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism was made. This was confirmed through a CT pulmonary angiogram  which showed a clot burden in the right pulmonary artery. D-dimer levels were significantly elevated  further reinforcing the diagnosis.  Slide 6: Treatment and Outcome Mr. Smith was promptly initiated on systemic thrombolysis and continued on anticoagulation. He was monitored closely in the ICU for potential complications like arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. After a few days  his condition stabilized and he was shifted to a regular ward before final discharge. Currently  he is on a long-term anticoagulant  and his recovery is closely monitored.  Slide 7: Conclusion This case underscores the importance of acute PE suspicion in patients presenting with sudden dyspnea  chest pain  and who have a history that includes risk factors for PE. Swift diagnosis and intervention can lead to successful patient outcomes.  Slide 8: Recommendations Focus on risk reduction strategies including mobility-post surgery  cessation of smoking  weight loss  and management of other comorbid conditions. Emphasize on the need for more research to prevent acute PE in high-risk patients.   END OF PRESENTATION

9,3,65,diagnosis9-prompt3-trial65,Title: A Clinical Paradigm: Acute Pulmonary Embolism   Slide 1: Patient's Background - Our case involves a 65-year-old Caucasian male  a retired engineer with a past smoker (1 pack/day for 30 years). - Demographics include living a relatively sedentary lifestyle  a BMI of 29  and a long-haul flight of 6 hours two days prior to the onset of symptoms.  Slide 2: Past Medical History - The patient has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol  which have been managed with diet and medication.  - He also had varicose vein surgery 4 years ago. - No known allergies to medications - Family History: His father died from myocardial infarction at 70  and his mother had a stroke at 80.  Slide 3: Current Presentation - The patient presented to the ER with complaints of sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath that progressed over a few hours. - He also reported a mild cough but denied fever  chills  or hemoptysis  Slide 4: Initial Assessment  - On physical examination  he appeared in moderate distress. - Vital signs showed tachycardia and decreased oxygen saturation. - An EKG showed signs of right heart strain.  Slide 5: Diagnosis: Acute Pulmonary Embolism - Based on the clinical picture and a raised level of D-dimer  an urgent CT pulmonary angiogram was ordered revealing a large clot burden in the right pulmonary artery. - Thus  a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism was made.  Slide 6: Risk Factors for PE  - This case highlights crucial risk factors for PE: prolonged immobilization (e.g.  long-haul flight)  past surgery  and personal lifestyle (e.g.  sedentary living  smoking).  Slide 7: Management  - After a risk stratification  our patient was deemed at high risk of death due to hemodynamic instability. Hence  he was admitted quickly and administrated thrombolytic therapy followed by anticoagulation treatment.  Slide 8: Learning Points - PE symptoms can vary significantly: our patient experienced chest pain and dyspnea but was not hypoxemic initially. - Risk factor identification is crucial. - Rapid diagnosis and treatment is needed in high-risk patients.  Slide 9: Further Research  - Future studies should aim for early recognition and prevention strategies particularly in patients with multiple risk factors for PE.   Slide 10: Conclusion - Acute Pulmonary Embolism is a potentially deadly condition  where risky demographic factors  medical history  and abrupt symptom onset all play a pivotal role in its recognition and skilled management.
9,3,66,diagnosis9-prompt3-trial66,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Case Study   Slide 1: Introduction: Present a case about acute pulmonary embolism  a life-threatening condition due to occlusion of the pulmonary vasculature which could potentially lead to organ damage and cardiovascular collapse if not treated promptly.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics: Our patient  Mr. James  is a 67-year-old African American male  retired  a non-smoker  and has no history of alcohol or drug abuse.  Slide 3: Presenting Complaints:  Mr. James presented with sudden-onset sharp chest pain and shortness of breath. He also reported a sense of impending doom  palpitations and mild lightheadedness.  Slide 4: Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension - well-controlled with medication. 2. Type 2 Diabetes - managed with diet and Metformin. 3. Past DVT 2 years back - received three months of oral anticoagulation.  Slide 5: Family Medical History: Father passed away due to stroke and Mother died due to a coronary artery disease.  Slide 6: Recent History: Mr. James recently had right hip replacement surgery six weeks ago. No notable complications at time of surgery. Post-operative mobility  however  was reduced and slow to improve.  Slide 7: Diagnosis: Given the symptoms and past history  there was a high index of suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism. A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed a filling defect within the right and left lower lobe pulmonary arteries consistent with an acute pulmonary embolism.  Slide 8: Acute Management: Mr. James was immediately started on therapeutic anticoagulation with Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH). His oxygen levels  heart rate and blood pressure were stabilized and monitored relentlessly.  Slide 9: Long term management: After stabilization  Mr. James was transitioned to oral anticoagulation. Due to the recurrent event  a lifelong anticoagulation plan was designed. His underlying risk factors were addressed further with lifestyle modifications and regular follow-ups.  Slide 10: Conclusion: This case emphasizes the need to consider acute pulmonary embolism in any patient with sudden chest pain and dyspnea  particularly those at risk  like Mr. James who had a recent hip replacement surgery and a previous history of DVT.

Slide 2: Past Medical History Mr. Jones has been generally healthy with no significant past medical history. However  he has been sedentary for the past 4 weeks following a right hip surgery due to a fall at home. He is a former smoker for 20 years and quit smoking 10 years ago. No known allergies were reported.  Slide 3: Symptoms at Presentation He was brought to the ER due to acute onset of shortness of breath  cough  and mild chest pain  particularly when breathing deeply. He was also sweating profusely  feelings of apprehension  and lightheadedness.  Slide 4: Clinical Picture On examination  Mr. Jones showed signs of fast heart rate (tachycardia) and his oxygen saturation levels were lower than normal. He was anxious and appeared clinically distressed.  Slide 5: Differential Diagnosis  Based on his clinical presentation and recent orthopedic surgery  the initial diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was considered. Other differential diagnoses such as pneumonia  myocardial infarction  pneumothorax  and rib fracture were also considered.  Slide 6: Investigations An Electrocardiogram (ECG) initially showed sinus tachycardia with no signs suggestive of myocardial infarction. D-Dimer test was significantly elevated. A CT Pulmonary Angiogram confirmed the presence of blood clots in both lungs  thus confirming the diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism.  Slide 7: Management Mr. Jones was started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) immediately and subsequently switched to rivaroxaban  an oral anticoagulant. Supplemental oxygen was provided to maintain oxygenation levels.  Slide 8: Prevention Measures  To prevent reoccurrence  Mr. Jones was counseled on the need for early mobility post-surgeries  hydration  and compliance with anticoagulant medications. He was followed up and monitored by hematology for any signs of recurrence  bleeding complications  and adjustment of his anticoagulant therapy.  Slide 9: Conclusion  This case illustrates the importance of considering Acute Pulmonary Embolism in patients with sudden onset shortness of breath  especially in those with risk factors such as immobilization from recent surgery. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are vital in reducing mortality associated with this condition.    Slide 10: References (Sources of any data or images presented)

Slide 2: Patient Demographics & Lifestyle  - Our patient is a retired school teacher who also has a history of sedentary lifestyle. She is a lifetime non-smoker. She has no known allergies. Family history reveals no genetic disorders but her father died of a cardiovascular disease.   Slide 3: Past Medical History  - The patient previously suffered from stage II hypertension and had an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a total hip replacement two years ago. There is also a recently diagnosed case of hormone replacement therapy-induced estrogen excess. All these are risk factors for pulmonary embolism. She has been consistent with her prescribed anticoagulant therapy to prevent recurrent DVT.  Slide 4: Present Illness  - The patient's symptoms started suddenly this morning. Chest pain increased with deep inspiration and did not radiate anywhere. She also admitted to feeling nauseous and had vomited once earlier in the day.  Slide 5: Diagnosis and Investigations  - On examination  her heart rate was 110 beats per minute and blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg. She appeared anxious and was sweating. She had reduced breath sounds on the lower half of the right lungfield.  - While blood tests showed elevated D-dimer levels  the ECG displayed features of acute right heart strain. A CT pulmonary angiography confirmed a large embolus in the right pulmonary artery extending to its lower lobe branch  validating our diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Slide 6: Management and Discussion - She was immediately started on therapeutic doses of intravenous heparin. A multidisciplinary team was consulted and a plan to perform catheter-directed thrombolysis was drafted given her high risk factors.   - This case highlights the importance of identifying risk factors of pulmonary embolism in patients  timely management and how existing conditions such as DVT and hypertension can contribute to the development of acute disorders such as a pulmonary embolism.  Slide 7: Conclusion - Awareness of risk factors and early recognition of signs is pivotal for prompt treatment and improved patient outcomes in cases of acute pulmonary embolism. Regular checks on patients with a history of blood clot-related disorders are recommended to monitor their health condition and prevent a recurrent episode.
9,3,90,diagnosis9-prompt3-trial90,Title: A Case Study on Acute Puline Embolism  Slide 1: Introduction  Acute Pulmonary Embolism is a common and sometimes life-threatening cardiovascular disease wherein the pulmonary artery is obstructed by blood clots that have travelled from distant sites  often from the lower limbs. Let's examine a case in detail to understand the disease from a clinical perspective.  Slide 2: Patient's Demographics & Past Medical History Our patient is a 69-year-old  Hispanic male weighing approximately 90 kilograms with a height of 170 cm. In regards to his past medical history  he is a known case of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension for the last 15 years  has a 30 pack-year smoking history  and reports high cholesterol levels.   Slide 3: Presenting Clinical Features The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden-onset shortness of breath and chest pain that worsened while taking deep breaths  which started around 4 hours prior to arrival at the hospital. He also reported a mild cough  low grade fever  and mild hemoptysis.  Slide 4: Diagnostic Tests  Based on clinical suspicion  a series of tests were conducted. D-Dimer test was positive. A CT pulmonary angiogram was immediately conducted which gave a definitive diagnosis of pulmonary embolism  revealing multiple emboli in the patient's pulmonary arteries. An EKG showed sinus tachycardia and signs of right heart strain.   Slide 5: Treatment Provided The patient was given intravenous heparin immediately along with oxygen to alleviate dyspnea  and was later transitioned to oral anticoagulants. Also  aggressive control of his diabetes  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia  and counseling for cessation of smoking was initiated.  Slide 6: Discussion and Conclusion Acute pulmonary embolism is a severe and potentially fatal condition. Clinicians must have high index of suspicion  particularly in patients with risk factors such as advanced age  smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and hypercholesterolemia. Rapid diagnosis and initiation of treatment can significantly reduce the associated morbidity and mortality.

9,3,99,diagnosis9-prompt3-trial99,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Caucasian Male  Slide 1: Introduction:  Today  we will discuss a case of acute pulmonary embolism (APE)  a potentially lethal condition  usually a result of thromboembolism from the leg veins travelling up to the pulmonary artery.  Slide 2: Demographics and Past Medical History:  The patient is a 52-year-old Caucasian male who otherwise lives a physically active life working as a banker. His medical history includes a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 3 years ago  for which he completed his course of anticoagulants. He is a current smoker with a 20 pack-year history. His past surgical history includes a successful cholecystectomy 5 years ago with no complications.  Slide 3: Presenting Complaints: The patient arrived at the clinic with complaints of sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath that started around 2 hours prior. He also reported lightheadedness and a feeling of fast heart rate.   Slide 4: Investigations: Given his past history and present symptoms  suspicion for APE was quite high. The patient underwent an ECG  chest X-ray  D-dimer testing  and a CT pulmonary angiogram which confirmed the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism.  Slide 5: Treatment and Prognosis: Treatment was immediately initiated with anticoagulants to prevent further clot formation. Thrombolytic therapy was considered but ruled out given his relatively stable vital signs. Patient's smoking cessation was strongly advised.  Slide 6: Discussion and Learning Points:  This case elucidates the importance of considering APE in patients with sudden onset breathlessness  especially with past DVT history regardless of effective course completion. It highlights the timely need for appropriate diagnostic tests and prompt initiation of anticoagulation therapy. Moreover  it underscores the role of primary prevention  such as smoking cessation and early mobilization to prevent DVT.  Slide 7:  Conclusion: With acute pulmonary embolism  the key is in suspecting the diagnosis  especially in those with risk factors such as previous DVT  genetic conditions  immobilization and smoking. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can significantly improve the prognosis.  Slide 8: Questions Opening up for any queries regarding the case  the diagnosis  management or prevention of APE.

In this case  the patient represents a typical demographic (middle-aged male with sedentary lifestyle) and risk factors (previous DVT  hypertension  obesity  and immobilization) associated with acute pulmonary embolism. His presenting complaint of shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness are symptomatic of acute pulmonary embolism. The presence of relevant past medical history further supports the problem representation of acute pulmonary embolism. The direct relationship between DVT  immobilization  obesity  and pulmonary embolism makes the diagnosis more likely. It is also important to note his hypertension which requires continued management and may also have contributed to his current condition.

Past Medical History:  1. The patient has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower limb about two years ago  which was managed with anticoagulants. 2. She has been diagnosed with hypertension for the past ten years  under control with medication.  3. She underwent total knee replacement surgery on both knees one year ago  after which she was relatively immobile for a period due to post-operative pain.  4. She is a former smoker  having quit about 10 years ago. She smoked a pack a day for approximately 25 years. 5. The patient has a family history of pulmonary embolisms  with her mother having suffered from the same condition.  Social History:   The patient resides at her home with her husband. She is limited in her physical activities due to fear of repeat DVT. She does not consume alcohol or any illicit drugs.  Allergies:   No known drug allergies.  Understanding of Problem:  Based on the current presentation  past medical history  and demographic information  it is suspected that this patient is suffering from Acute Pulmonary Embolism  which is an obstruction of a pulmonary artery or one of its branches  frequently due to a thrombus that originated in the systemic venous system or in the right heart chambers. Considering her history of DVT  knee surgery  prolonged immobilization period  hypertension  smoking history  and family history of PE  she shows several risk factors associated with Pulmonary Embolism.

He is an active smoker for the last 20 years.  - He is employed as a taxi driver  - The patient lives with his wife and their two children.  - He is overweight  with a BMI of 28.  - He drinks alcohol on social occasions only.  Past medical history:  - The patient has a known history of high blood pressure and heart disease. His hypertension has been under control with medication. - His mother died of pulmonary embolism at the age of 59. - He had a left leg fracture 2 months prior due to a minor accident  for which he underwent surgery and was immobile for a few weeks.  - The patient had a myocardial infarction 3 years back. - No other significant illnesses are reported.  Presenting Symptoms:  - The patient presents with increasing shortness of breath over the past 12-24 hours.  - He felt sharp  stabbing chest pain that increased with a deep breath. - The patient also reports dizziness  fainting  and rapid heart rate. - His wife noted that he is more restless and sweats excessively.   This problem representation suggests a typical patient with acute pulmonary embolism  considering his age  gender  past medical history  lifestyle  family history  and current symptoms. Other factors to consider would include any medications the patient is currently taking  any allergies he has  and any results from past or current diagnostic tests. These pieces of information may further guide the healthcare provider in making a diagnosis.
9,6,61,diagnosis9-prompt6-trial61,Patient Profile:  Identifying Information:  Patient's initials are J.D.  58-year-old Caucasian female  married with two children  and work as a schoolteacher.  Presenting Problem: J.D. presents to the emergency department reporting acute onset shortness of breath  chest pain radiating to the back  and mild lightheadedness which started about four hours ago. She mentions a history of a long-distance flight about two days prior.  Review of Symptoms:  a. Respiratory: Acute dyspnea  chest pain  no cough or wheezing. b. Cardiovascular: Tachycardia noted upon admission. c. Neurological: Mild lightheadedness  no vertigo  no loss of sensation or coordination  no difficulty speaking or swallowing. d. Other symptoms: Patient denies any recent fevers  chills  nausea  vomiting  or urinary symptoms.  Past Medical History:  J.D. has a history of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT)  obesity (BMI 33.5)  and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) three years back managed with anticoagulants for six months. Surgical history includes a cholecystectomy 10 years ago. Family history indicates that her father had DVT and Pulmonary Embolism (PE).   Medications: J.D. is on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). She denies any allergy to medications.  Social History: Patient lives with her husband and two children; they own a cat. She is employed as a schoolteacher and denies any drug use  smoking  or excessive alcohol intake.   Physical Examination: Upon examination  J.D. appears fatigued and mildly anxious. Her blood pressure is 146/92 mmHg  heart rate 104 beats per minute  respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. The rest of the physical examination including cardiovascular and musculoskeletal review is unremarkable.   Initial Thoughts: Given the acute onset of her symptoms  her history of DVT and HRT  and her recent long-distance travel  an acute pulmonary embolism (PE) needs to be ruled out. Further diagnostic workup is needed including a D-dimer test and possibly CT angiography of the chest. Her current medical management and further risk factor modification should be reviewed based on her results to prevent future thromboembolic events.
9,6,62,diagnosis9-prompt6-trial62,Problem Representation: Mr. Smith is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of obesity  hypertension  and stage III chronic kidney disease. He is a longtime smoker with a 30-pack year smoking history. He also had an orthopedic surgery for a total knee replacement 1 month ago.   Yesterday  he abruptly began experiencing chest discomfort  rapid heart rate  shortness of breath  and faintness. He also mentioned that he has been coughing up blood. There is no history of fever  loss of consciousness  or neurological deficits. There is no previous history of similar presentation.   Mr. Smith's symptoms  along with his demographic and clinical background as well as recent surgery  strongly suggest a high risk for acute pulmonary embolism. His significant risk factors include age  smoking  obesity  immobilisation post-surgery  and chronic kidney disease. His symptoms such as sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath  coughing up blood  and tachycardia are classic signs of a pulmonary embolism.   His diagnostic evaluation should include a D-dimer test and imaging studies like Pulmonary angiogram  Chest CT angiography or V/Q scan. Immediate anticoagulation therapy should be considered while awaiting diagnostic results depending on the initial clinical assessment of his PE risk.   This approach will help confirm the diagnosis and guide subsequent management strategies respectively. The process will not only take into account his current clinical syndrome but also his past medical history  comorbid conditions as well as the risk involved in his potential treatment.  Patient education regarding the importance of postoperative mobility and risk factor management is also crucial in his condition. His previous smoking history and chronic diseases need special attention while planning for his long-term management.

9,6,66,diagnosis9-prompt6-trial66,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male with a body mass index of 27 indicating that he is overweight. He has a history of 40 years of tobacco cigarette smoking  with an average of one pack per day. He recently retired from his job of 25 years as a truck driver where he spent long hours sitting.  Presenting Symptoms:  He presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsens with deep breaths. He also mentions that he has been feeling dizzy and lightheaded. Moreover  he notices occasional coughing up small amounts of blood. The symptoms appeared several hours ago  and he did not have any trauma  injury or excessive exertion preceding it.  Medical History:  His past medical history includes hypertension for 20 years  high cholesterol for 15 years  and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his left leg 6 months ago. He has been compliant with his prescribed medications  including an antihypertensive (lisinopril) and a statin (simvastatin).  He completed his course of anticoagulation therapy for DVT 2 months ago.  Family History:  He reports his father suffered a stroke at 67 years old and his mother suffered a myocardial infarction (heart attack) at 72.  Social History:  The patient admits to continuous tobacco use and reports consuming alcohol socially. He lives alone and has been fairly sedentary since his retirement.  Thought Process:  The patient's long history of smoking  prior incidence of DVT  recent immobilization due to substantial sitting from his previous job  and the recent discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy all increase his risk for a pulmonary embolism.  The sudden onset of symptoms and the nature of his chest pain also raise a high index of suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism. Confirmatory testing should be performed  including a D-dimer assay and CT pulmonary angiography.  Areas of Concern:  High risk of mortality if not treated promptly  risk of recurrent DVT and potential for post-thrombotic syndrome  chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension  and pulmonary infarction. The patient's substantial smoking history also puts him at risk for other cardiovascular and lung diseases.
9,6,67,diagnosis9-prompt6-trial67,Patient Problem Representation:  Chief Complaint: A 65-year-old  overweight  Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with a one-day history of sudden onset  severe shortness of breath  and chest pain that gets worse with deep breaths.  Demographics: He is a retired teacher  lives with his wife  and is a former smoker (quit 10 years ago  with a history of 30 pack-years). He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. He is relatively sedentary and spends much of his time sitting or laying down.   Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension  for which he is on Metformin and Lisinopril  respectively. He was also diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in his left leg five years ago  for which he was treated with warfarin. However  he stopped taking the medication two years ago on his own accord.  Family History: There is a family history of coronary artery disease (his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60).  Review of Systems: He denies any fever  cough  hemoptysis  palpitations or syncope. However  he mentions that his left leg has been slightly swollen and painful for about a week.  Social History: The patient and his wife recently returned from a long car trip (12+ hours).  Sexual History: He is married and monogamous.  Occupational Histories: Retired teacher  currently doesn't partake in any strenuous activities.   Allergies: No known drug allergies.  Medications: Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension.  Immunization History: Up-to-date on all recommended vaccines.   This presentation is consistent with a possible Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE). His risk factors include a history of DVT  prolonged immobility during a long car ride  obesity  and advanced age. His abrupt onset of symptoms suggests an acute event  while his chest pain  shortness of breath and previous unilateral leg swelling/pain may suggest embolic event. His past medical history of stopping warfarin  a prescribed anticoagulant  also puts him at an increased risk for thromboembolic events. His family history of coronary artery disease may also accelerate the disease process if it has not been adequately managed.

9,6,71,diagnosis9-prompt6-trial71,Problem Representation:   A 68-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and recent hip replacement surgery (trauma)  is presenting to the emergency department with acute onset of dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain and mild hemoptysis. The patient reports that the symptoms started suddenly last night  making it increasingly difficult for him to catch his breath. Additionally  there is a family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). He is currently on medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and has been on a prescribed course of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (anticoagulant) post his hip replacement surgery.   Overall  this phenotype represents a senior patient with considerable cardiovascular morbidities and a recent surgical history  presenting with classic symptoms of a potential pulmonary embolism. Given his past medical history and the nature of symptoms  it is critical to rule in or out the diagnosis of PE.   Key Attributes:  - Age: 68 years old - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Past Medical History: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  Hypertension  Hyperlipidemia  Total Hip Replacement Surgery  - Family history: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE) - Current Medications: Anti-hypertensives  Statins for hyperlipidemia  Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin - Chief Complaint: Acute onset of dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  and mild hemoptysis.     This patient belongs to a high-risk group due to recent surgery (increased risk of blood clots)  COPD (increased susceptibility to respiratory complications)  hypertension (increased cardiovascular strain)  and relevant family history  all of which can lead to the occurrence of PE. His current symptoms of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and hemoptysis are also consistent with acute PE. Hence  he immediately warrants diagnostic testing and potential therapeutic procedures for addressing pulmonary embolism.

9,6,73,diagnosis9-prompt6-trial73,Patient Profile:  Name: John Smith  Age: 62 years  Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired military officer Residence: Urban domicile Marital Status: Married Smoking habit: None Alcohol use: Moderate Recreational drug use: None  Past Medical History: John has been diagnosed with bilateral knee osteoarthritis for which he underwent bilateral knee replacement surgery 3 weeks ago. He also has controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past 10 years  for which he takes antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medications daily. John was also diagnosed with peripheral artery disease 5 years ago. He has no known allergies.  Family's Past Medical History: Father died at age 65 of myocardial infarction. His mother is still alive  age 88  has type II diabetes. His brother  aged 59  has a history of deep vein thrombosis.  Current Complaint:  John came to the hospital complaining of acute onset shortness of breath that started two hours prior to his arrival. He also mentions having sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsens with deep breaths  and lightheadedness. There is no cough present  no fever  and no history of recent travelling.  Representative Problem: Given John’s recent orthopedic surgery and his family history of deep vein thrombosis  the fact he presents with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain and lightheadedness is highly suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism. This hypothesis aligns with the patient's medical history  risk factors (like recent immobilization due to surgery)  and clinical presentation. The severity of pulmonary embolism can range widely; urgent action is required in order to confirm the diagnosis and manage the patient appropriately.

Relevant Investigations: Considering her symptoms  recent surgical history  and family history  she is immediately sent for investigation including D-Dimer  CT pulmonary angiogram  arterial blood gases  and ECG.  Impression: Given the recent surgery  symptoms  and family history  the index of suspicion is high for acute pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis. The patient’s condition is moderately severe  immediate intervention and anticoagulant therapy are required.
9,6,77,diagnosis9-prompt6-trial77,Problem Representation:  Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Female Patient with Past History of Chronic Medical Conditions  Patient Demographic Information:  - Age: 56 - Gender: Female - Race and/or ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Office worker - Lifestyle: Sedentary  occasional smoker  moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History:  - Diagnosed with obesity (BMI 30.5) - Hypertension managed with oral antihypertensive medication - History of hyperlipidemia - Chronic Venous Insufficiency. - Previous diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) 2 years ago  successfully treated. - No known allergies  Clinical Presentation:  The patient comes in to the emergency department complaining of recent onset of chest pain that is sharp and increases with deep breathing. She also mentions sudden shortness of breath  coughing up blood and unexplained lightheaded/dizziness. On physical examination  tachycardia and tachypnea are observed.  The combination of the patient’s sudden clinical presentation  history of DVT and other risk factors such as obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and hypertension all raise an immediate concern for acute pulmonary embolism.  The next step in management would be to obtain a validated risk-stratification tool  such as the Wells score  to further identify the need for diagnostic workup. Imaging studies like CT pulmonary angiography  D-dimer testing and potentially an Echocardiogram or Pulmonary angiogram would be effective in confirming the diagnosis of a pulmonary embolism.  Treatment strategy will then be formulated based on risk stratification results  which in most cases may involve anticoagulation therapy along with monitoring and potentially more aggressive interventions for high-risk patients.

9,7,1,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial1,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 56-year-old Hypertensive and Diabetic Patient  Case Report:  Patient Information:   The patient is a 56-year-old male of African American descent  currently working as a school teacher. He does not drink alcohol  smoke  or use recreational drugs. The patient has a known medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which are currently being managed with pharmacotherapy - lisinopril 20 mg daily for hypertension and metformin 500 mg BID for diabetes.  History of Present Illness:  The patient was admitted to the emergency department presenting with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain (typically pleuritic  worse with deep breathing)  and mild hemoptysis. These symptoms had been persisting for the last 24 hours. Upon questioning  the patient denied leg pain or swelling.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. His blood pressure was 158/92 mmHg  pulse rate was 110 bpm  respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation was 88% on ambient air  and body temperature was 37.1°C. Cardiac auscultation revealed tachycardia  but no murmur. Lung auscultation was unremarkable. There were no signs of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) on examination of lower extremities.  Investigations:  An ECG showed sinus tachycardia but was otherwise unremarkable. Lab investigations were notable for raised D-dimer levels at 0.75 μg/ml (reference range: up to 0.5 μg/ml) and slightly elevated troponin-I at 0.06 ng/ml (reference range: up to 0.03 ng/ml). Complete blood count and renal function were within normal ranges  while fasting blood glucose was slightly elevated at 149 mg/dl (normal range: 70-99 mg/dl).  Given the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE)  a CT angiography was performed which confirmed the presence of a large central clot in the right pulmonary artery.  Management and Outcome:  Hemodynamically stable but with severity criteria  the patient was admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit and started on anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) and bridged to long-term oral anticoagulation therapy with rivaroxaban. Patient's symptoms started to resolve within the first week of treatment  and a repeat CT angiography after a month showed resolution of the pulmonary embolus. The patient was advised to continue with his rivaroxaban and was scheduled for follow-up appointments with both the pulmonologist and the cardiologist.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for PE in patients with risk factors such as age  hypertension  and diabetes presenting with non-specific chest symptoms.
9,7,2,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial2,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:  Mr. J  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain. Other details about the patient: he is an ex-smoker  having stopped smoking 5 years ago after an accumulated four years of consuming one pack of cigarettes per day. He is a retired office worker and lives with his wife. His BMI is 28.0 kg/m2  does not consume alcohol and has no known allergies. In terms of the patient's family history  both his parents had coronary artery disease; his mother died at the age of 81 and his father at 78.  Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago  which is being controlled by Lisinopril. Also  Mr. J has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was under anticoagulation therapy with Warfarin until two years ago. He discontinued anticoagulation since he did not experience any further episodes of DVT. There is no history of diabetes  stroke  or pulmonary disease.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. J complained of sudden onset chest pain that began approximately 12 hours before admission. He described the pain as characteristic of tightness around the chest that gradually intensified. Associated with this  he reported dyspnea and palpitations but denies symptoms of fever  cough  syncope  or hemoptysis.   Clinical Findings:  On clinical assessment  his heart rate was 115 beats/minute  blood pressure was 130/88 mmHg  respiratory rate was 22 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry was 91% on room air. Physical examination revealed that his chest was clear on auscultation and the rest of the examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An electrocardiogram (ECG) was conducted  demonstrating sinus tachycardia  and S1Q3T3 pattern suggestive of acute right heart strain secondary to pulmonary embolism. Urgent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was suggestive of a large embolus obstructing the right pulmonary artery  in coordination with clinical findings and ECG results. D-Dimer test was significantly elevated at 3 500 ng/mL (reference range <500 ng/mL).  Therapeutic Interventions: Initial management included administration of oxygen via nasal prongs. To manage the acute pulmonary embolism  he was started on anticoagulation treatment with low molecular weight heparin  enoxaparin  according to weight-based dosing. After appropriate risk assessment  systemic thrombolysis was considered but excluded due to a moderate risk of bleeding.   Follow-up and Outcomes:  Mr. J's symptoms gradually improved over the next 48 hours. He was discharged home on long-term oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban.  Patient Perspective:  Mr. J expressed concern about the recurrence of blood clot-related issues but was reassured about the efficacy of the prescribed therapy.  Informed Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this anonymous case report.   Acknowledgments: The team appreciated the cooperation and consent of Mr. J for developing this case report.
9,7,3,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial3,Patient Information: A 55-year-old Caucasian male  known smoker with a history of high blood pressure  presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain particularly upon breathing in  and mild dizziness. The patient is a taxi driver by profession and reports being sedentary most of the day. He has no reported allergies.  Clinical Findings: On initial assessment  the patient appeared anxious and in respiratory distress with noticeable tachypnea. Vitals revealed blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg  heart rate of 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation at 92% on room air. Physical examination was notable for decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes bilaterally  and mild pitting edema in the ankles. There were no signs of trauma or injury.  Diagnostic Assessment: Preliminary investigations included chest X-rays that showed no obvious signs of pneumonia  pleural effusion  or pneumothorax. Electrocardiogram (EKG) indicated a possible right ventricular strain pattern with a prolonged QT segment. Lab findings showed a mildly elevated troponin I level of 0.5 ng/dL and D-dimer was notably elevated at 1 500 ug/L. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) revealed a P(a)O2 of 72 mmHg and carbon dioxide at 35 mmHg with a slight metabolic acidosis.  Given the clinical picture and these findings  an acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was suspected. Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed and confirmed multiple filling defects in the segmental and subsegmental arteries of both lung lobes consistent with acute PE.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on unfractionated Heparin infusion. Oxygen therapy was given to maintain saturation above 95%. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and stabilization  and cardiology was consulted for further management and assessment. Once stable  the patient transitioned onto oral anticoagulant (Rivaroxaban).   Follow up and Outcome: The patient showed considerable improvement over the next few days. On day 5  he was transferred out of ICU to the medicine ward. After a total of 7 days  the patient was discharged on a long-term oral anticoagulant plan. He was also given a follow-up appointment in two weeks to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy.  Teaching Points and Patient's perspective: This case highlights the importance of suspicion and immediate diagnosis of PE in individuals presenting with sudden-onset dyspnea  chest pain  and history of prolonged sedentarism. The patient's understanding of his condition was essential for appropriate management. He was informed about the importance of regular follow-ups after initiation of therapy. Advice was also provided for lifestyle modifications like avoiding smoking  increasing physical activity  monitoring blood pressure  and adhering to his anticoagulation regime.   Conclusion: Prompt recognition and appropriate management of acute PE significantly improves prognosis and reduces adverse outcomes. Long-term anticoagulation significantly reduces the risk of recurrent PE. Additionally  educating patients about their condition helps in adherence to therapy and lifestyle modifications. 
9,7,4,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial4,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 58-year-old Female with a History of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Recent Surgery: A Case Report  **Case Presentation**  The patient  a 58-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department with the sudden onset of shortness of breath and a feeling of heaviness in the chest. She had a past medical history significant for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed 2 years earlier. Additionally  she recently underwent a total knee arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis three weeks prior to presentation. She is a nonsmoker and has no known history of pulmonary diseases or heart disease.  Past relevant medications include warfarin for DVT  which she stopped a week before her surgery following her doctor's advice. After the surgical procedure  she was on low-dose aspirin as VTE prophylaxis but did not receive any heparin therapy post-surgery. Her family history was remarkable  with her father having died from myocardial infarction and a half-sister diagnosed with DVT.  **Clinical Findings**  Physical examination revealed a slightly distressed patient with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute  a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure 130/80 mmHg  oxygen saturation at 92% on room air. Auscultation of the chest demonstrated reduced breath sounds over the right lower lobe  but no wheeze or crepitations were noted.  **Timeline**  On the initial presentation  an ECG was done which showed sinus tachycardia. A D-dimer test was positive  blood gases showed slight hypoxemia with marginally reduced PaO2 and mild respiratory alkalosis. Troponin levels were slightly elevated.  **Diagnostic Assessment**  Given her concerning symptoms  coupled with her recent surgery and history of DVT  a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed to rule out Pulmonary Embolism (PE). The CTPA scan confirmed an acute PE with a large embolus in the right lower lobar artery. No signs of right heart strain were reported.  **Therapeutic Intervention**  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and started on unfractionated heparin. Given her symptoms and risk factors  a decision was made to start a therapeutic dose of anticoagulants. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was also considered due to a past history of DVT and recent immobility secondary to surgery.   **Follow-up and Outcomes**  With therapeutic management  the patient's symptoms gradually improved over the following week. At a one month follow-up appointment  she reported no residual breathlessness or chest discomfort. A follow-up CTPA scan was planned to evaluate the resolution of the embolus.  **Patient Perspective**  The patient expressed gratitude for the prompt diagnosis and treatment. She acknowledged the role of her past medical history in the development of the PE and reinforced her commitment to adhere to post-discharge instructions  especially lifelong anticoagulation medication.  **Conclusion**  This case emphasizes the importance of considering PE in patients presenting with sudden unexplained breathlessness  particularly those with risk factors such as history of venous thromboembolism and recent surgery. Timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial to ensure good patient outcomes. 
9,7,5,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial5,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Female with Prior Deep Vein Thrombosis   Introduction: This case report describes a 53-year-old Caucasian female  presenting with a significant symptomatology suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolism (APE)  with a past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Case Presentation: The patient  who works as an office clerk  is a non-smoker  and her BMI is within normal range (21.7). She had an episode of deep vein thrombosis two years ago  which was managed with an anticoagulant (warfarin) for six months. She has stopped the regular use of anticoagulant ever since the completion of the recommended course and hasn't had any recurrent DVT symptoms. She has no known history of diabetes  hypertension  or heart disease. She stated that her mother had a history of stroke at the age of 60 years.  She arrived at the emergency department complaining of sudden-onset dyspnea  sharp chest pain  and light-headedness  which had started about five hours before her arrival. She also reported anxiety and had a mild cough but no fever. On examination  her blood pressure was mildly elevated at 140/90 mmHg alongside an increased heart rate at 105 bpm. Her respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was low at 90%.  Investigations: Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed signs of right heart strain  suggestive of pulmonary embolism. Blood test revealed increased d-dimer levels. An immediate computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was ordered  which confirmed the presence of a clot in the right pulmonary artery  confirming the diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE). A lower limb venous Doppler ultrasound was performed  showing no signs of DVT.  Treatment and Outcome: The patient was immediately started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for her acute pulmonary embolism and admitted to the cardiology ward. Once stabilized  her treatment was switched to oral anticoagulant therapy (warfarin). She was educated about the chronic nature of her condition and the necessity of lifelong anticoagulation. On her two weeks and then three months follow up appointments  she reported a significant improvement in her symptoms and her repeat CTPA showed resolution of the pulmonary embolus.  Conclusion: It is important to consider PE in patients with past medical history of DVT  even in the absence of current DVT symptoms. While DVT recurrence is rare  monitoring for symptoms of PE is crucial. This case highlights the significance of long-term anticoagulant therapy in high-risk patients to prevent PE recurrence.
9,7,6,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial6,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 65-year-old Female Patient with Known Atrial Fibrillation and Obesity  Patient Information The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female with a body mass index of 31 kg/m^2  height of 165 cm  and weight of 85 kg.   Present Medical History She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation  obesity  and hypertension. These diagnoses were made 7 years ago. The patient also has a history of frequent long haul flights over the last year due to work commitments. She has been on 10mg Warfarin once daily for her atrial fibrillation and 5mg Amlodipine for her hypertension. Her Body Mass Index suggests that she suffers from Class 1 obesity.  Case Presentation She presented to the emergency department complaining of suddenly experiencing severe shortness of breath  sharp stabbing chest pain  and feelings of dizziness. She also reported a recent increase in the swollenness of her left lower leg  which she presumed was due to a leg strain.   Physical examination revealed that the patient was in distress  had an elevated heart rate (110 bpm)  and increased respiration rate (22 breaths per minute). Oxygen saturation was at 90% on room air. On auscultation  heart sounds were rhythmically irregular; the lungs were clear. Her left calf was swollen  tender  and warm to touch  suggesting a deep vein thrombosis.  Clinical Findings An immediate ECG revealed signs consistent with an acute right heart strain. The D-dimer test was requested and came back significantly elevated. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram was performed and confirmed the presence of an acute pulmonary embolism.  Due to the patient’s history of atrial fibrillation  obesity  and frequent travels that included long  uninterrupted flights  she was deemed to be at high-risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE).   Treatment The patient was started on intravenous heparin and admitted to the intensive care unit for further management. Given her acute presentation  she was also discussed for possible thrombolysis or interventional radiology pulmonary embolectomy.  Outcome and Follow-up The patient responded well to the anticoagulation therapy. At the follow-up visit 3 months later  she reported no more shortness of breath. However  she was counselled about her high risk of recurrent VTE events and the importance of adequate anticoagulation therapy  weight control  and the necessity to take walks on long flights.  In conclusion  this case highlights the importance of early recognition and initiation of treatment for pulmonary embolism  especially in patients with high-risk factors such as atrial fibrillation  obesity  and frequent long flights.   Learning Points 1. Early recognition and treatment can improve the prognosis of acute pulmonary embolism vastly. 2. Patients with high-risk factors for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism should be counselled on strategies to decrease their risk and educated on/kept aware of symptoms of these potential complications. 
9,7,7,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial7,Title: An Unusual Case of Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Introduction: An interesting case of a 60-year-old African-American male patient who presented with acute pulmonary embolism is being reported. Better knowledge and understanding of the patient’s past medical history can result in an improved diagnosis.  Case Presentation:  Mr. X  a 60-year-old African-American male known to have a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  visited our emergency department with severe difficulty in breathing along with chest pain. The patient is a non-smoker and doesn’t have a family history of thromboembolic disease. He had a significant past medical history of venous DVT in the left lower leg due to a motor vehicle accident around 4 years ago. The patient had been taking warfarin regularly for his condition.  Examination and Investigations:  On examination  he had a heart rate of 92 beats per minute  blood pressure was 140/90mmHg  respiratory rate was 20 cycles per minute  and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. During physical examination  jugular venous distention was identified. He had clear but a bit brisk lung fields  suggestive of some underlying lung pathology. An EKG confirmed tachycardia but no other significant changes.   Because of his breathlessness  persistent chest pain  and previous DVT history  we suspected a pulmonary embolism (PE). An urgent Computer Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) was ordered which revealed a large thrombus in the left main pulmonary artery confirming the diagnosis of acute PE.   Management:  The patient’s oxygen saturation was further depleting which called for immediate action. He was started on high-flow oxygen via a mask. Anticoagulation therapy was also started immediately with intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin. The patient’s warfarin dosage was adjusted considering his coagulation parameters.  Outcome and Follow-up:  His condition started to improve considerably after 48 hours. Repeat CTPA was carried out after 5 days of treatment to determine the position and size of the thrombus. Thrombus size had significantly decreased and symptoms also were reduced significantly. The patient was discharged with advice to continue warfarin and regular monitoring of his coagulation parameters. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for 8 weeks later.   Conclusions:  This case highlights the importance of recognizing acute PE in patients with a history of DVT who come in with symptoms of chest pain and breathing difficulty. Early diagnosis with relevant investigations is the cornerstone in managing such critical cases to prevent fatal outcomes.  Socio-demographic data is crucial for identifying population groups with a high risk of PE. Equipped with this knowledge  healthcare professionals can prioritize preventative measures in high-risk groups to improve patient outcomes.
9,7,8,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial8,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male with an established medical history of chronic atrial fibrillation (AF)  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hypertension. The Patient also has a known history of smoking. He's currently on Warfarin for AF  Metformin for T2DM  and Lisinopril for hypertension. The patient was not known to have any drug allergies and lives with his wife who is primary caregiver.  Case Presentation: The patient presented to the emergency department with progressive shortness of breath  chest pain  and sudden onset left-sided pleuritic pain. The Patient was also experiencing episodes of lightheadedness with increased fatigue over the past week. There was no history of hemoptysis  fever  or travel.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient appeared in respiratory distress with respiration rate of 26 breaths per minute  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg  body temperature of 37.5°C  an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. Chest auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds on the left.   Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: An arterial blood gas (ABG) test result showed hypoxemia with a PaO2 of 65 mmHg. Complete blood count  serum electrolytes  and kidney function were within normal limits. Troponin levels were slightly elevated. Electrocardiogram revealed tachycardia with frequent atrial ectopics but no ST-T changes.   Considering the clinical presentation and examination findings  a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed and confirmed the presence of multiple segmental pulmonary emboli in the left lung.   Therapeutic Focus and Assessment: The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism was thus made  and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Parenteral anticoagulation with therapeutic Enoxaparin was initiated immediately. The dose of enoxaparin was adjusted to renal function  and he was monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding. His existing medication of Warfarin was discontinued temporarily due to the risk of bleeding.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: The patient responded favourably to the treatment. Over a period of several days  he showed improvement in respiratory and hemodynamic parameters. On discharge  anticoagulation was switched from Enoxaparin to Apixaban after discussing the risks and benefits of long-term oral anticoagulation. The patient was given detailed counselling on lifestyle modifications and the importance of strict adherence to the medication.   A follow-up appointment was planned in the outpatient clinic after four weeks to assess his clinical condition and adjust medication as needed.  Key Learning Points: 1. Acute Pulmonary Embolism should be highly suspected in patients with worsening respiratory status and risk factors like atrial fibrillation. 2. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulation can improve outcomes significantly. 3. Transition from parenteral to oral anticoagulation  as possible  involves careful consideration of the patient's individual risk-benefit profile.   Readers can find this case interesting since it illustrates classic approach to suspected acute pulmonary embolism  particularly in a patient with multiple comorbidities. The management highlights the lasting need for thorough follow-up care and lifestyle counseling.

Past Medical and Surgical History:  The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension  for which he takes Ramipril 5mg daily  and hyperlipidemia  managed with Atorvastatin 20mg daily. He also takes Aspirin 75mg daily for prophylaxis against ischemic heart disease. There was no history of any significant surgical intervention or any prior incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE).   Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  the patient was found to be in mild distress  with rapid pulse rate (110 bpm)  slightly increased blood pressure (140/90 mmHg) and an increased respiratory rate (22 breaths/min). Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed S1Q3T3 pattern (indicative of right heart strain). Blood tests revealed increased levels of D-dimer  a common biomarker for clot degradation.  Diagnosis:  Due to the presence of risk factors (age  smoking history  sedentary lifestyle  hypertension  hyperlipidemia)  the presenting symptoms  exam findings  and relevant tests results  an acute pulmonary embolism was suspected.  Imaging:  A CT pulmonary angiogram was performed  which confirmed the presence of a large clot in the right pulmonary artery  affirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment:  The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy with intravenous heparin in the emergency department and subsequently switched to oral apixaban before hospital discharge. The patient's previous anticoagulation with Aspirin for ischemic heart disease prophylaxis was discontinued.  Outcome and Follow-Up:  The patient reported a gradual improvement of symptoms over the next few days and was discharged after 6 days in the hospital. He was advised to quit smoking  maintain a balanced diet  and start a regular program of physical activity. His progress and anticoagulation status will be evaluated during follow-up appointments in the thrombosis clinic.

He has a body mass index of 28 and leads a sedentary lifestyle. His alcohol intake is moderate  and he denies any illicit drug use.   Presenting Complaint: John presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. He reported that the chest pain was worse upon breathing  and he was experiencing light-headedness.  Medical History:  Patient has a medical history of Type II Diabetes  Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia for which he is on medication - Metformin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin  respectively. A year ago  he underwent a total knee replacement surgery on his right knee. He had a history of smoking for about 35 years but quit 10 years ago.  Family History: Patient's father had myocardial infarction at age 60 and mother had stroke at age 75. His only sibling  a brother  is living and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Present Illness:  John began experiencing slight calf pain two days before the chest discomfort and dyspnea appeared. He did not seek medical attention  attributing it to his recent intensified physical therapy sessions for his knee.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  John appeared anxious  with a respiratory rate of 23 breaths/min  heart rate of 110 beats/min  blood pressure of 135/90 mmHg  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. His chest was clear on auscultation. Cardiac auscultation showed tachycardia with regular rhythm  and no murmurs. His right calf was swollen  red  and tender.  Diagnostic Assessment: 1) Electrocardiogram (EKG): Showed sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern suggestive of pulmonary embolism. 2) D-dimer: Elevated - 900 ng/ml (Normal: <500 ng/ml) 3) Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA): Identified a large clot in the left pulmonary artery.  Therapeutic Intervention: John was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and started on anticoagulation therapy. He was admitted to the hospital for further monitoring and management.  Patient’s Progress: John responded well to the treatment. His chest pain and dyspnea improved considerably. Follow-up venous Doppler ultrasonography of the right leg confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The anticoagulation therapy was continued. He received education about DVT and PE and the importance of adhering to his medications.  Conclusion:  John’s sedentary lifestyle  coupled with his recent surgery  likely contributed to his DVT  which subsequently led to his PE. This case emphasizes the importance of considering PE in patients presenting with abrupt onset chest pain and dyspnea  especially when associated with risk factors such as recent surgery and personal or family history of venous thromboembolism. Timely diagnosis and management are crucial to prevent fatal consequences.

9,7,26,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial26,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 65-year-old Male with Chronic Atrial Fibrillation: A Case Report  Introduction:  Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old African-American male  presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset dyspnea  chest pain  and fainting. Previous medical history included chronic atrial fibrillation  for which he had been on anticoagulation therapy (warfarin) for the past five years. He also had a past medical history of hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus.  Case Presentation:  Mr. Doe reported experiencing a sudden sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsened with deep breathing. He also reported episodes of hemoptysis and palpitations. His vitals on presentation were: Blood pressure 105/70 mmHg  pulse 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation 88% on room air  and temperature 98.6°F. On physical examination  he appeared anxious with cold and clammy skin.  Investigations:  Blood tests revealed elevated D-dimer levels. His chest x-ray was generally unremarkable  while an electrocardiogram (ECG) showed signs of right heart strain and atrial fibrillation. Computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram showed a large clot in the left pulmonary artery suggestive of a pulmonary embolism.   His INR was noted to be intherapeutic (1.9) upon examination. He also reported poor medication adherence due to the complexity of his medication regimen and frequent INR monitoring.   Management:  The patient was immediately started on full-dose unfractionated heparin and his oxygen was titrated to keep the oxygen saturation above 94%. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to the size of the embolism and potential risk for hemodynamic instability. After stabilization and further consultation with cardiology  the decision was made to switch Mr. Doe's anticoagulant therapy to direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) to improve medication adherence.  Outcome and Follow-up:  Mr. Doe’s hospital course was complicated by transient acute kidney injury  likely due to hemodynamic changes associated with the acute pulmonary embolism. However  this resolved with intravenous fluids and he was clinically stable by day four. He was transitioned from heparin to apixaban before discharge  with a follow-up appointment arranged with his primary care physician and cardiology.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the potential for severe pulmonary embolism even in patients on anticoagulant therapy  particularly when issues with medication adherence arise. Early recognition and rapid initiation of treatment for acute pulmonary embolism saved the life of this patient. It also emphasizes the importance of educating patients about the significance of medication adherence  potential complications of non-adherence  and the life-threatening risks associated with co-existing atrial fibrillation.

The patient also described experiencing episodes of dizziness and occasional bouts of mild coughing.  Medical History: The patient has a known medical history of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  both controlled with regular medication (Metformin and Losartan respectively). The patient had experienced no allergies or drug interactions before the current episode. He is a former smoker with a history of 25-pack years  having quit ten years ago. There is no known family history of clotting disorders.  On Presentation: On observation  the patient appears anxious  with noticeable pallor. He was slightly tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/minute and exhibited a pulse oximetry reading of 93% on room air. On auscultation  the lungs showed diminished breath sounds. His blood pressure was elevated (143/92 mm Hg) but his heart rate was within normal limits. However  a 12-lead EKG suggested nonspecific ST changes but no clear signs of right heart strain.  Diagnosis and Management: Given the patient’s presentation and medical history  an immediate D-Dimer test was ordered  which came back significantly elevated. A subsequent CT scan with pulmonary angiography revealed a large clot burden in the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery  indicating an acute pulmonary embolism.  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring and initiated on anticoagulation therapy with intravenous heparin. After initial stabilization  the patient was switched to oral anticoagulants. The patient was also given supplemental oxygen to maintain his saturation above 95%  and his chest pain was managed with analgesics.  The patient was advised regarding lifestyle modification considering his sedentary occupation. He was also advised to continue the anticoagulants  strictly maintain control of his hypertension and diabetes  and prevent dehydration to reduce the risk of clot formation.  Outcome:  The patient’s breathlessness and chest pain progressively relieved after initiating treatment. His condition remained stable during his hospital stay  and he was deemed stable enough for discharge on the fifth day post-admission. He has been scheduled for regular follow-ups with his primary care physician for close monitoring.  Discussion: This case reiterates the mystery that is pulmonary embolism  often presenting with nonspecific symptoms that may be misinterpreted or overlooked entirely. Prompt attention to the symptoms and immediate tests like D-Dimer test in the ED can aid in the timely diagnosis and management of this potentially life-threatening condition. Regular follow-up and optimal management of comorbid conditions are essential to prevent recurrence."

He reported progressive worsening of these symptoms throughout the day.  Medical History: The patient has a known medical history of prostate cancer  which was diagnosed eight years ago and managed with radiation therapy and androgen deprivation therapy. He also has hypertension controlled with a regimen of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. He had no history of surgeries or allergies. He neither smokes nor drinks alcohol. He was an office worker before retirement.   Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  the patient exhibited tachycardia  noted at a rate of 110 beats per minute  and tachypnea  with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. He was afebrile but his oxygen saturation was low at 88% on room air. The patient also expressed pain in the chest that grew worse upon deep breathing. His blood pressure was marginally high at 150/90 mm Hg.  Diagnostic Assessment: With suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism based on clinical symptoms  computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was immediately conducted. The results confirmed a large embolus located in the right main pulmonary artery extending into the lower lobar branches.   Laboratory findings included elevated D-dimer levels and Troponin-I levels suggestive of a possible myocardial injury  which is not uncommon in cases of severe pulmonary embolism. Complete blood count  renal function  liver function test  and coagulation profile were essentially within normal limits.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on systemic thrombolysis using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) due to the extensive nature of the clot. Additionally  he was kept on oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula and anticoagulation therapy with heparin was initiated.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient reported an alleviation in his symptoms within 24 hours. Repeat imaging performed one week later showed substantial resolution of the embolus. The patient was subsequently transitioned to oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and he was referred to a pulmonary rehabilitation program.   Patient Perspective: Though frightened by the sudden onset of his symptoms  the patient was relieved with the rapid diagnosis and treatment. He expressed gratitude for the team's quick response and thorough care.  Informed Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.  Conclusion: This case highlights the significance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in a patient presenting with chest pain and breathlessness  especially in those with risk factors like malignancy and hypertension. Immediate imaging and initiation of thrombolytic therapy can bring about swift resolution and prevent complications.

He also complained of a sudden onset of shortness of breath  palpitations  and light-headedness. He denied any symptoms of fever  cough  sputum production  hemoptysis  or night sweats. His past medical history was notable for hypertension  intermittent atrial fibrillation (AF)  and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following orthopedic surgery 3 years ago. He is currently taking antihypertensive medication and anticoagulation.   Clinical Findings:  On initial examination  he was anxious  diaphoretic  wheezing  and in noticeable distress. He had a blood pressure of 95/60 mmHg  tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. On cardiovascular examination  there was a prominent P2 component of the second heart sound. The rest of the physical examination was within normal limits.  Diagnostic Focus  Assessment  and Treatment:  An ECG showed sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern suggestive of acute cor pulmonale. His blood tests revealed elevated D-dimer levels. A contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  indicating a clot located in the right main pulmonary artery extending into the lower lobe branches.   He was immediately begun on high flow oxygen and therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by oral anticoagulation therapy. In light of his AF and previous DVT  the decision was made for long-term anticoagulation.  Mr. T was admitted to the hospital for close observation and stabilization. He tolerated the treatment well without any complication. He was educated about his condition  the importance of medication adherence  and regular follow-ups.   Conclusion:  Mr. T was discharged after 5 days when his symptoms were significantly improved  and he remained stable.

9,7,38,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial38,Title: A Case Report of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 65-year-old Male  Abstract: This case report describes the presentation  diagnosis  and management of a 65-year-old male with acute pulmonary embolism. Despite underlying comorbidities  including a history of hypertension  type II diabetes  and obesity  the patient was able to make a full recovery following a timely diagnosis and treatment.  Patient Information: The patient was a 65-year-old Caucasian male who had been previously diagnosed with hypertension  type II diabetes  and obesity. He was on medication for hypertension (lisinopril) and diabetes (metformin). The patient was a retired truck driver  had a history of smoking but quit 5 years ago  and had a sedentary lifestyle.  Medical History: His past medical history included a myocardial infarction at the age of 55  several episodes of unexplained syncope  and lower leg edema. These comorbidities placed the patient at an elevated risk for the formation of clots  leading to pulmonary embolism.  Presenting Complaints: The patient presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset dyspnea  palpitations  and pleuritic chest pain that started two hours before presentation. He also reported feeling light-headedness but had no loss of consciousness.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient was anxious  tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute  tachycardiac (heart rate 110 bpm)  and hypotensive (blood pressure 90/60 mmHg). S1 and S2 were regular without any added sounds. Chest examination revealed reduced breath sounds in the right lower zone.  Diagnostic Assessment: A set of routine laboratory tests was performed. Arterial blood gases showed hypoxemia with a PaO2 of 64 mmHg. The D-dimer test was significantly elevated at 2000 ng/mL (normal 0-500 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. The diagnosis was confirmed with a CT pulmonary angiogram  which showed multiple thrombi in the right lower lobe vessel.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was started on oxygen therapy immediately to correct hypoxemia and was throttled on heparin with a target aPTT of 60-80 seconds. After hemodynamic improvement  oral anticoagulants were started  and heparin was overlapped for 5 days then discontinued.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient's symptoms improved over two weeks  with reduction in breathlessness and hypoxia. Follow-up at 3 weeks showed the patient had returned to his normal daily activities without any symptoms. The patient was continued on anticoagulants  and regular monitoring was advised given his preexisting comorbidities.  Conclusion: This case offers insight into early recognition  diagnostic strategy  and the management of acute pulmonary embolism even in patients with underlying comorbidities. It highlights the importance of awareness of this fatal condition and the requirement for immediate interventions to improve patient outcomes.

Patient education about medication compliance is crucial especially in the management of these cases to prevent potentially fatal recurrences.
9,7,43,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial43,Patient Information:  Mr. John Smith  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the hospital presenting symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). He is a resident of Florida  USA and a retired engineer. He lives with his wife and has no children.   Patient Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for the past ten years (stage 2  moderate severity as per the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease classification). He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed one year ago. He had been adhering to the recommended anticoagulant therapy until his current admission.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient was brought to the emergency department with complaints of a sudden onset of shortness of breath experienced for a period of two hours. He also reported accompanying chest discomfort  mild hemoptysis (coughing up of blood)  and palpitations.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient was anxious and in respiratory distress with oxygen saturation of 89% on room air. His heart rate was 110 beats per minute and blood pressure was 145/90 mmHg. On auscultation of the chest  decreased breath sounds and crackles were observed in the right lower lung field.  Investigations:  An immediate ECG showed sinus tachycardia. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed which confirmed a large embolus in the right pulmonary artery. His D-dimer levels were especially high  which often indicates the presence of a clot. Due to his recent DVT and current symptoms  a Doppler ultrasound exam of his lower limb veins is also performed which revealed a thrombus in his left femoral-popliteal vein. This suggests the source of the PE.   Management and Outcome:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous heparin as a bridge to warfarin. Anticoagulant therapy was continued as the main treatment for his condition. The patient's shortness of breath improved significantly over the next few hours  and he was clinically stable within 48 hours. After five days of hospitalization  the patient was discharged and instructed to continue his long-term oral anticoagulant therapy at home.  Follow-up Care:  Mr. Smith was advised to follow-up every two weeks to monitor his INR (International Normalized Ratio). Moreover  he and his wife were counseled about the importance of adherence to medication and to lookout for signs of abnormal bleeding or recurrences of PE or DVT.  Discussion:  This case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and management of PE  particularly in patients with a history of DVT.

9,7,47,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial47,Patient Description:  Patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  with a BMI of 27.1  a lifetime non-smoker  former military serviceman  currently retired  presented at the emergency department with acute breathlessness and chest pain.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient complained of a sudden sharp  stabbing chest pain that started a few hours prior and was intensified by deep breathing. He also reported mild coughing and shortness of breath  but had no signs of fever  hemoptysis  or syncope. Although the patient appeared anxious  his vitals at presentation showed slight tachycardia (heart rate at 110 beats per minute)  normal temperature  and normal blood pressure (143/87 mmHg).  Past Medical History:  The patient had a medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left calf ten years ago  which was managed successfully with anticoagulants. He also has a 3-year history of high blood pressure and is currently on antihypertensive medication  which is well-controlled. The patient underwent left knee arthroscopy 8 days ago. His mother died from a sudden stroke at the age of 72  possibly pointing to a genetic predisposition in the family.  Clinical Findings:  Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed tachycardia with no significant ST changes  and chest radiography showed no distinctive pulmonary abnormalities or pneumonic consolidation. A blood test showed a highly elevated D-dimer level.  Diagnosis:  Based on the patient's symptoms  medical history  and clinical findings  he was suspected of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was immediately performed and confirmed the presence of acute bilateral pulmonary embolisms.  Management:  Given the patient’s medical history of DVT and recent orthopedic surgery  he was considered a high-risk PE patient and was therefore admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and treatment. Intravenous heparin was initiated as a bridging therapy  and the patient was then switched to oral rivaroxaban for long-term anticoagulation.  Outcome:  The patient's symptoms significantly improved after heparin infusion  and he remained hemodynamically stable throughout his ICU stay. After 4 days  he was transferred to a general ward and discharged home on the 7th day after initiation of anticoagulation therapy with outpatient follow-up appointments.  This case reflects the critical aspect of early diagnosis and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism  taking into consideration the patient's past history  presentation  and risk factors and utilizing appropriate diagnostic imaging. It also emphasizes the importance of recognizing the potential risk of PE in post-operative patients  even after minor surgeries.
9,7,48,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial48,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Postmenopausal Female with History of Deep Vein Thrombosis  Introduction:  This case report describes a 62-year-old African American postmenopausal female who presented with shortness of breath  followed by an acute episode of syncope  leading to the discovery of a large pulmonary embolism (PE).   Case Description:  A 62-year-old postmenopausal African American female presented to the emergency department with a 24-hour history of progressively worsening shortness of breath and an episode of syncope while at home.   The patient had several known risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE)  including a sedentary lifestyle  obesity (BMI of 32.5)  previous history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 5 years ago  and an ongoing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for hot flashes symptoms. She had denied any recent fractures  surgical interventions  or long-duration travel activities in the recent past.  On current admission  the physical parameters showed a blood pressure of 102/68 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min  and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The physical exam revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally with mild tachypnea. Cardiac exam showed tachycardia with a regular rhythm but no murmur  gallops or rubs. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Laboratory investigations revealed a high serum d-dimer value (1200 ng/mL) suggestive of thrombosis. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) showed evidence of respiratory alkalosis with hypoxemia.  Due to high clinical suspicion  a spiral CT scan was performed  which revealed a large thrombus occupying the right main pulmonary artery extending into its lower branches  confirming the diagnosis of PE.   Management & Follow-Up:  The patient was immediately anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. Given her DVT history  hormone replacement therapy has been discontinued. The PE was deemed sufficiently massive to warrant a thrombolytic therapy  which was done successfully with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The patient was subsequently transitioned to oral anticoagulation with Warfarin.  Her hospital course was also complicated by a hemodynamically significant right ventricular strain and with the initiation of treatment the hypoxia and tachycardia improved progressively. She was discharged on the seventh day  with follow-up appointments set with pulmonology and hematology for management of pulmonary embolism and evaluation for possible thrombophilia given her recurrent VTE events. Counseling on the risks of HRT  the promotion of physical activity and a healthier diet for weight control were also provided before discharge.   Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of high clinical suspicion and rapid initiation of treatment for PE  particularly in high-risk patients such as postmenopausal women on HRT with a previous history of DVT. It also highlights the necessity for thorough patient education about the risks of prescribed therapies and lifestyle modifications.  Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.

In conclusion  this case of acute pulmonary embolism highlights the importance of considering this diagnosis in patients presenting with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath  even without typical risk factors or suggestive findings on plain chest radiography. As is often the case  the simple test of D-dimer and a high index of suspicion led to the use of CT pulmonary angiography  the standard for the definitive diagnosis of PE."
9,7,55,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial55,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Male: A Case Report  Introduction:  This case report details the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism in a 52-year-old African American male.  Case Presentation:  A 52-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of sudden-onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations. The patient described the chest pain as dull  exertional  and radiating to the left arm. He also reported mild lightheadedness but no syncope  cough  or hemoptysis.  The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus but no known lung or heart diseases. He is a smoker with a 20-pack-year history and has a sedentary lifestyle. He takes metformin  lisinopril  and simvastatin but reports inconsistent medication compliance. His family history is significant for coronary artery disease. The patient had no known drug allergies.   On examination  the patient was found to be anxious  with a heart rate of 110 bpm  blood pressure of 145/92 mm Hg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally. His cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable.  Investigations:  Due to the patient's symptoms and risk factors  acute pulmonary embolism was suspected. Blood tests revealed elevated levels of D-Dimer. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia and a S1Q3T3 pattern suggestive of acute right heart strain but no evidence of ischemia. A CT pulmonary angiogram was performed and confirmed the presence of a large embolus in the right pulmonary artery  confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment and Outcome:  The patient was immediately administered intravenous heparin and later transitioned to oral anticoagulation with warfarin. His shortness of breath and chest pain improved significantly over the next few days. He was discharged home on oral anticoagulants  instructed to quit smoking  increase physical activity  and adhered strictly to his prescribed medications. Appropriate follow-up was arranged.  Discussion:  This case highlights the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath  particularly in those with risk factors such as hypertension  diabetes  smoking  and a sedentary lifestyle.

9,7,56,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial56,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Patient with Unremarkable Health History  Introduction:  An 82-year-old Caucasian female with a seemingly unremarkable medical history arrived at the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset chest pain and difficulty breathing. The patient also reported increased fatigue over the past week. No known history of smoking  regular alcohol consumption  or illicit drug use. The patient denied any recent surgeries or immobilization and was not on any regular medications prior to presentation. Family history was significant for deep vein thrombosis in a brother; however  detailed family history was inconclusive due to lack of information.  Clinical Findings:  Upon admission  vital signs revealed tachypnea with a rate of 24 breaths per min  blood pressure of 138/82  heart rate consistent with tachycardia at 110 beats per min  and oxygen saturation at 93% on room air. Physical examination elicited pleuritic chest pain on the right side. Breath sounds were reduced in the lower right lung field  but there were no overt signs of lower limb edema or cyanosis.   Investigations:  A D-dimer test confirmed a value of 5000 ng/mL (reference range <500 ng/mL). Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed signs of S1Q3T3  suggestive of acute cor pulmonale. Her echocardiogram presented signs of right ventricular pressure and volume overload with pulmonic acceleration time reduced at 80 ms. Computated tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) revealed a large filling defect within the main pulmonary artery and its right and left branches  confirming a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE).  Treatment and Outcomes:  The patient was immediately managed with supplemental oxygen and continuous monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU). Anticoagulative therapy was initiated using unfractionated heparin. Despite aggressive management  the patient’s condition quickly deteriorated and thrombolytic therapy with alteplase was administered due to severe right ventricular strain and worsening clinical condition. Following thrombolysis  significant clinical improvement was noted with stabilized vital signs within 24 hours.  Discussion:  Acute pulmonary embolism is a severe  potentially fatal condition that presents with nonspecific symptoms  often making it challenging to diagnose promptly. Despite no immediate risk factors or prior medical history  this case highlights the need for high clinical suspicion  especially in elderly patients presenting with acute onset dyspnea  chest pain  and signs of hemodynamic instability. Prompt diagnosis and aggressive management can potentially improve outcomes and reduce mortality from this potentially fatal condition. As PE may be the first manifestation of thrombotic tendency  it's imperative that elderly patients with unexplained PE are screened for inherited prothrombotic conditions.  Conclusion:  Acute pulmonary embolism remains a diagnostic challenge due to heterogeneous clinical presentation. High clinical suspicion remains the key to timely diagnosis and management. This case underscores the significance of recognizing PE  even in patients without overt risk factors  given the high morbidity and mortality associated with the condition.

She is non-smoker  experiences moderate alcohol intake  and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to her work nature.  Chief Complaint: She was presented to the hospital with acute onset shortness of breath accompanied with mild chest discomfort  lightheadedness  fainting spells  and palpitations. These symptoms began roughly 24 hours prior to her admission.   Medical History: Mrs. L has a significant medical history with an episode of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) three years ago. She was managed conservatively with oral anticoagulants with regular follow-up. She also reported chronic hypertension  which is controlled with medications prescribed by her primary care physician.   Examinations and Tests: On examination  her blood pressure was noted as 145/90  heart rate 105/min  respiratory rate 24/min  and oxygen saturation at 92% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sound in the right lower zone. Venous Doppler ultrasound of both lower extremities suggested no current DVT. The D-Dimer level was markedly elevated (1200 ng/mL). A Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) was performed revealing multiple filling defects in the right main pulmonary arteries. This confirmed a diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism (PE).   Diagnosis: Based on clinical presentation  high D-dimer levels  and confirmation on CTPA  the patient was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.  Management and Outcome: The patient was immediately initiated on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and oral anticoagulant therapy. She was given supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation above 96%. As her vitals stabilized and her clinical condition improved  she was monitored in the hospital for the next seven days during which she remained stable. She was discharged with long term oral anticoagulant therapy and set for follow-up with a Pulmonologist and Hematologist. Counseling about lifestyle modification  regular exercise and DVT prophylaxis was also provided in the context of her sedentary work.  Discussion: This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion of acute PE in patients with a known history of DVT even if currently non-apparent  especially when presenting with respiratory symptoms.

9,7,58,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial58,Patient Information:  Mr. John Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented himself at our emergency department. He is retired  lives alone and has no known allergies. He has a significant medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and hypertension. He is a former smoker but quit around 10 years ago. He does not consume alcohol and denies any illicit drug use. His medication includes daily low-dose aspirin and beta-blockers for hypertension.  Chief Complaint:  The patient presented with a 4-hour history of sudden onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath. He also reported experiencing palpitations  light-headedness  and a feeling of anxiousness.  Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  the patient appeared diaphoretic and in acute distress. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure  150/90 mmHg; heart rate  110 bpm; respiratory rate  24 breaths per minute; temperature  37.5°C; and oxygen saturation  91% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed tachycardia with no audible murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Pulmonary examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the right lung base. No edema or tenderness observed in lower extremities.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Given the patient’s symptoms and past medical history  a suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was raised. A D-dimer test came back significantly elevated. Further diagnostic evaluation with a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest confirmed the presence of a large embolus in the right pulmonary artery.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was immediately started on heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Concurrently  the thrombolytic agent  tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)  was administered.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  After 48 hours  repeat CT scanning showed a remarkable decrease in the size of the clot  and his symptoms had significantly improved. Mr. Smith was then switched from heparin to warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed to prevent new pulmonary emboli given his history of DVT.  He was discharged after a week with instructions to continue his warfarin therapy and a referral to an outpatient pulmonologist for further management and follow-up.  Mr. Smith's case underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment in patients with a high clinical suspicion of PE  especially in those with a history of DVT. In cases of massive PE  as seen in Mr. Smith  thrombolytic therapy may prove to be highly beneficial and life-saving.

Patient Information:  The patient is a 62-year-old female who is a nonsmoker and nondrinker  with a sedentary lifestyle. There were no known allergies. She was not on any regular medications  nor did she have any history of long-term immobility  recent surgeries  or underlying malignancies. Prior medical record demonstrated no history of personal or familial thromboembolic diseases  diabetes  hypertension  or any cardiovascular diseases. The patient was post-menopausal and didn't take hormone replacement therapy. No significant family history was documented.   Clinical Findings:   The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of breathlessness and pain in her right lower chest for a duration of 5 hours. She had no associated cough  fever  hemoptysis  or weight loss. There was no history of leg pain or swelling.   Diagnostic Assessment:   Vitals on presentation revealed a pulse rate of 106/min  blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg  respiratory rate of 26/min  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.   Initial laboratory testing showed elevated D-dimer levels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed which didn’t reveal any specific changes but showed sinus tachycardia. There were no specific findings on chest radiography. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was conducted given the high clinical suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism. The CTPA confirmed bilateral pulmonary emboli predominantly in the lower lobes.  Therapeutic Intervention:   The patient was immediately started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as per the hospital policy for confirmed pulmonary embolism. Due to her stable condition  thrombolytic therapy was not warranted. The patient was referred for prophylactic placement of an inferior vena cava filter due to her reduced mobility.  Follow-up and outcomes:   The patient was hospitalized for a week and showed significant improvement in symptoms. The anticoagulation therapy was continued  and oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban was initiated before discharge  with a plan to continue treatment for at least six months. She was advised to maintain an active lifestyle and was discharged in a stable condition.   Patient Perspective:  The patient reported a willingness to improve her lifestyle to prevent episodes in the future. She mentioned her relief upon understanding the importance of an early diagnosis and prompt treatment.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the critical aspect of considering a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a patient presenting with unexplained dyspnea  despite the lack of risk factors. Early diagnosis and proper thromboprophylaxis can result in a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality in such patients. It underscores the need for a high index of suspicion for acute PE  as delay in diagnosis and treatment can have fatal outcomes.
9,7,62,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial62,Title: A Case of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Female with Prior History of Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Information: The patient is a 52-year-old Caucasian female  who works as an office clerk  currently living in urban New York. She has a previous medical history significant for hypertension  obesity  and Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) treated five years ago.  Case Presentation: The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  which was sharp and worsened with deep breathing. She reported a one-week history of mild leg swelling and pain in her left lower leg. No prior recent travel history  immobility  trauma  or surgery was reported. The patient is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  and reports a daily alcohol intake of approximately 1-2 drinks. Her family history is significant  with her mother also having a history of DVT.  Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  the patient was anxious and in visible respiratory distress. Vital signs indicated tachycardia  with a heart rate of 110 bpm  respiration rate of 24 bpm  and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Her blood pressure was within a normal range. Lower extremity examination showed mild pitting edema and tenderness in the left calf.   Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: Given her symptoms and past medical history  we had a high clinical suspicion of Pulmonary Embolism (PE). An urgent D-dimer test was ordered which turned out to be considerably high. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was ordered and showed a large clot burden in the right pulmonary artery  confirming a diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was started immediately on therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)  with a plan to transition to oral anticoagulation once the patient's condition stabilized. Supportive care included the administration of oxygen by nasal cannula.   Follow-up and Outcomes: Within days  the patient reported less pain and demonstrated improvement in oxygen saturation levels. Prior to discharge  she was transitioned to oral anticoagulant  Rivaroxaban. The hospital's anticoagulation clinic planned for patient follow-up in one week and the importance of medication adherence and potential adverse effects were discussed with the patient.  Patient Perspective: The patient was anxious initially due to her sudden onset of symptoms but was cooperative throughout her stay. She showed a positive attitude towards lifestyle changes necessary to manage her condition.   Informed consent: Patient's written informed consent was obtained post stabilizing her condition.   It's deemed significant to report this case given the patient's medical history and the circumstances leading to her PE development highlighting the need for prolonged prophylaxis in individuals with a prior DVT incident. 
9,7,63,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial63,Patient Details:  Mr. Lopez  a 74-year-old Hispanic man with a residential address at New Mexico  visited the emergency room with emergent symptoms.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient presented with acute shortness of breath  rapid heart rate  and intermittent chest pain worsening over a period of two days. He also reported feeling light-headedness and experiencing a brief episode of dizziness.  Medical History and Lifestyle:  Mr. Lopez is a retired manual laborer  with past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the past  he has also been treated for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a long-haul flight three years ago. He is an ex-smoker and quit 15 years ago. He admits to a low-level alcohol intake and denies any recreational drug use. There is a family history of cardiac disease  with his father dying at the age of 61 due to myocardial infarction.  Current Medications: He is currently taking Metformin for his diabetes and Amlodipine for his blood pressure. At the time of admission  he was not receiving any anticoagulants.  Clinical Assessment: Upon physical examination  he appeared slightly diaphoretic but not in respiratory distress. Mr. Lopez's blood pressure was 160/90mmHg  pulse 105 per minute  and SpO2 of 90% on room air. Initial blood tests showed slightly raised D-dimer levels. A rapid COVID-19 antigen test was performed and reported negative. An ECG at this time showed sinus tachycardia without any ST changes.  Diagnosis and Treatment: Given his symptoms and clinical presentation  the patient was suspected to have an acute pulmonary embolism. This suspected diagnosis was later confirmed with a CT pulmonary angiogram  which showed a large clot burden within the main pulmonary arteries bilaterally.  Mr. Lopez was managed in the High Dependency Unit (HDU) and started on therapeutic intravenous heparin. His oxygen saturation was monitored continuously  and he was provided with supplemental oxygen therapy as required.  Prognosis and Follow-Up: The patient responded well to the treatment. His chest pain and breathlessness eased within a few days of starting anticoagulation therapy  and he was subsequently switched to oral anticoagulants. After a week  he was discharged with an appointment to attend the thrombosis clinic for follow-up and management of anticoagulation.  Mr. Lopez was also advised to minimize his risk of PE recurrence by maintaining a healthy weight  regularly exercising  taking his medication as prescribed  and staying hydrated. He was informed about the signs and symptoms of PE for increased vigilance.  Ethics: The patient provided written informed consent for his case details to be written and published. Personal identifying details were excluded for privacy.

9,7,64,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial64,Patient Information  A 55-year-old African American male  non-smoker  non-alcoholic  and without any known drug allergies presented to the emergency room with severe shortness of breath  chest pain  and sudden onset of fainting spells. The patient's medical history reveals hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and deep vein thrombosis. The patient is currently on medication  including Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes  Losartan 100mg daily for hypertension  and Warfarin 5mg daily for deep vein thrombosis.  Clinical Findings  On examination  he appeared anxious  sweaty  and in respiratory distress with a notably rapid  shallow breathing pattern. His vital signs revealed tachycardia with heart rate up to 120 beats per min  blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  and oxygen saturation level of 89% on room air. There was leg swelling  which was more pronounced on the left side. Auscultation of the lungs revealed reduced breath sounds in the right lower zone. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.   Diagnostic Assessment  A complete blood count demonstrated a slightly increased white cell count of 13 000/mm^3  while other hematological parameters were within normal limits. The D-Dimer was markedly elevated at 4000 ng/mL(normal: less than 500 ng/mL).  Electrocardiography (ECG) showed a sinus tachycardia. Imaging studies were then conducted  including a chest X-ray  which revealed no significant findings. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scan showed filling defects in the right lower lobar artery which confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE).  Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was promptly administered oxygen therapy and placed on continuous monitoring. The pre-existing Warfarin therapy was suspended  and he was initiated on intravenous heparin; aimed at achieving a target activated partial thromboplastin time 1.5–2 times the normal range. In addition  the patient received parenteral morphine for pain management.  Follow-up and Outcome  Reassessment after 48 hours showed significant improvement in his symptoms  with a reduction in tachycardia and improved oxygen saturation levels. Once his condition was systemic  he was discharged on long-term oral anticoagulation therapy (Rivaroxaban) for six months. Upon his follow-up a month later  there was a remarkable improvement  and no complications were reported. He will continue on the Rivaroxaban for another five months and is planned for regular 3-month follow-ups and imaging studies to monitor his status.   Conclusion  This case illustrates the importance of considering acute PE in patients presenting with shortness of breath and chest pain. Timely intervention and appropriate treatment can significantly improve patient outcomes. Despite being on anticoagulation therapy for deep vein thrombosis  the patient still developed PE  which emphasizes the need for regular follow-up and patient education about the importance of medication adherence and recognizing symptoms of potential complications. 
9,7,65,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial65,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Previously Healthy 53-year-old Female: A Case Report  Patient Information:  The patient is a 53-year-old Caucasian female. She was previously healthy  with no known chronic illnesses or regular medication use. She doesn’t have a history of any surgeries. She mentioned that she does not smoke  drink  or use illicit drugs. She works from home as a copy-editor and has a minimal level of physical activity. She reported she was taking oral contraceptive pills for menstrual regulation. Her family medical history reveals that her father had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but was not currently under any treatment.  Chief Complaint:  She presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of difficulty in breathing and sharp chest pain which was intensified while taking a deep breath. She also mentioned that she’s been feeling ‘light-headed’ for the past few hours.  Clinical Findings:  Her physical examination revealed that she was tachycardic  with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and tachypneic  with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure was 130/85 mmHg  and her oxygen saturation was at 94% on room air. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular rhythm  and pulmonary auscultation showed decreased breath sounds on the right lower side.  Diagnostic Assessment:  The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a sinus tachycardia and a S1Q3T3 pattern  suggestive of pulmonary embolism. D-dimer levels were significantly raised (4500 ng/mL). A Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the presence of a large clot in the right main pulmonary artery. Her lower extremity Doppler ultrasound showed no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Therapeutic Intervention:  Given the acuteness of her situation  systemic thrombolysis with alteplase was immediately administered following hospital protocol. After she was stabilized  anticoagulation with very low molecular weight heparin was started as a bridge to warfarin therapy.  Outcome and Follow-up:  The patient had significant relief from her symptoms after thrombolysis. Following 5 days of inpatient care  she was discharged on long-term warfarin therapy. A review after one month showed the patient was symptom-free and had adjusted well to the anticoagulation therapy.  Given the patient's positive family history of DVT and the usage of oral contraceptives  it may have predisposed her to a thromboembolic event. This case accentuates the need for considering individuals’ risk factors for pulmonary embolism and ensuring appropriate risk management strategies are in place.  Learning Points:  1. Acute pulmonary embolism should always be considered in patients presenting with sudden onset of unexplained shortness of breath  chest pain  and palpitations. 2. A high index of suspicion should be maintained in patients with risk factors like familial history of thrombotic events  sedentary lifestyle  and hormone use. 3. Immediate therapeutic intervention can significantly impact the patient's quality of life and decrease mortality. 4. Educating patients about the need for lifestyle modifications and the risks associated with oral contraceptives utilization  especially in the context of positive family history  is critical.
9,7,66,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial66,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 45-year-old Male: A Case Report  Patient Information: A 45-year-old Caucasian male  a commercial truck driver by profession  presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute onset dyspnea and chest pain. The patient was a heavy smoker (2 packs/day for over 20 years)  overweight (Body Mass Index of 31 kg/m2)  and has a family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE).  Clinical Findings: The patient described a sharp  central chest pain radiating to his left arm  with sudden onset of shortness of breath. He denied any preceding cough  fever  hemoptysis  or recent travel. His vital signs at the time of presentation were blood pressure 155/95 mmHg  heart rate 110 bpm  respiratory rate 28 per minute  oxygen saturation of 91% on room air  and temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable; his lungs were clear to auscultation  heart sounds were normal without added sounds  and there was no lower limb edema or tenderness.  Diagnostic Assessment: Given the patient's presenting symptoms and medical history  an acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was suspected. The patient underwent an electrocardiogram (EKG) that showed sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T wave changes. A D-dimer assay was ordered  which returned elevated at 5000 ng/ml (normal range 0-500 ng/ml).   The patient was subsequently referred for a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)  confirming the presence of a large obstructive thrombus in the right pulmonary artery. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated cardiac troponin (0.3 ng/ml; normal range 0-0.1 ng/ml)  and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (900 pg/mL; normal range 0-100 pg/mL) thus pointing towards right ventricular strain.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on therapeutic unfractionated heparin. Owing to the presence of right ventricular dysfunction and the high risk of deterioration  the patient was referred for emergency thrombolysis with alteplase.   Follow up and Outcomes: The patient’s clinical condition improved over the next few hours with a decrease in dyspnea and chest pain. A repeat CTPA after 24 hours showed significant resolution of the thrombus. The patient was switched to oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban and was discharged after a week with instructions for lifestyle modifications including weight loss  smoking cessation  and regular exercise.  Conclusion: This case underlines the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain  particularly in the presence of risk factors. Early diagnosis and aggressive management are essential to prevent potentially fatal outcomes in this condition.
9,7,67,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial67,Title: A Case Report on Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 67-Year-Old Male Patient  Introduction: A 67-year-old Caucasian male patient was brought into the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness that started approximately two hours before presenting to the hospital.   Patient Information:  The patient  Mr. Forsythe  is a retired school teacher with a past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. He has no known drug allergies. He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol socially. He has a family history of heart disease; his father died from myocardial infarction at the age of 65.   Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient appeared distressed with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and blood pressure of 155/95 mmHg. His oxygen saturation on room air was 90%. He had evidence of right ventricular heave but no jugular venous distention. The rest of the cardiovascular and respiratory examination was unremarkable. He had slight edema in the lower extremities.   Diagnostic Assessment:  An urgent EKG was indicative of right ventricular strain  a sign often associated with acute pulmonary embolism. Blood tests showed elevated D-dimer levels. The patient's atrial fibrillation and recent long-haul flight led us to consider the high probability of a thromboembolic event. A CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed the diagnosis  and showed a large clot in the right pulmonary artery with signs of right heart strain.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Immediately after the diagnosis  the patient was started on therapeutic anticoagulation with intravenous heparin and scheduled for catheter-directed thrombolysis. His initial response to the treatment was positive with a significant improvement in symptoms and normalisation of vitals.  Follow Up and Outcomes:  Mr. Forsythe  over the course of the following week  made a good recovery with gradual resolution of symptoms and improvement of vital parameters. He was bridged from heparin to a direct oral anticoagulant and was given instructions for strict compliance due to his risk of recurrent thromboembolic events. Lifestyle modification advice was also provided. His follow-up appointment was scheduled in the anticoagulation clinic in two weeks and cardiology clinic in one month.  Patient's Perspective: Mr. Forsythe expressed his gratitude for the quick diagnosis and effective treatment. He admitted his initial fear and anxiety  but appreciated the comprehensive explanation of his condition and the plan for his ongoing care.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in patients with sudden onset unexplained dyspnea  chest pain  and hypoxia particularly those with risk factors for venous thromboembolism such as atrial fibrillation and recent prolonged immobilization. Early diagnosis and treatment significantly influence  and can potentially be lifesaving in these patients.
9,7,68,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial68,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Female Patient with an Unknown History of Thrombophilia  Patient Information: Ms. A is a 54-year-old Caucasian woman residing in Ohio with no known history of serious medical conditions. She is a non-smoker and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to her occupation as a software developer. Her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. Her father succumbed to a myocardial infarction at the age of 65.  Presenting Complaints: Ms. A presented in the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath which started around 2 hours prior to her arrival.  Past Medical History:  The patient’s known personal medical history is unremarkable  with her only complaint being occasional lower extremity edema  specifically in her right leg. She was not on any regular medications or hormonal therapies. She denied a history of miscarriages  deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  or pulmonary embolism (PE).  Clinical Findings: At the ED  her blood pressure was normal (130/70mmHg) but her heart rate was elevated (110 bpm). She had a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  SpO2 was 90% on room air and her temperature was 98.6°F. Physical examination revealed tachycardia and decreased breath sounds on the right side of the chest. Her right calf appeared swollen and tender on palpation.  Diagnostic Assessment: Suspecting PE  a D-dimer test was ordered  which returned positive. A computerized tomographic pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed  confirming the diagnosis by showing a large clot in the lower lobe of the right lung. A Doppler ultrasound of the right leg was performed  revealing deep vein thrombosis confirming the source of the embolism.   Additionally  given her symptoms  family history  and lack of known risk factors  the decision was also made to test her for thrombophilia. Thrombophilia panel revealed heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation  which was previously unknown.  Treatment: The patient was promptly started on anticoagulant therapy with intravenous heparin. Once the patient was stabilized  she was switched over to oral anticoagulants (Warfarin) for continued therapy. Leg elevation was recommended to reduce the edema  and intermittent pneumatic compression devices were used to prevent worsening of DVT.  Outcome and Follow-up: Ms. A responded well to the treatment  and experienced a significant relief of her symptoms in the following days. She will be scheduled for routine follow-ups for monitoring her anticoagulation status and evaluation of her DVT.  Learning Points: This case reinforces the importance of considering thrombophilic conditions in patients presenting with PE  despite having no known or discernible risk factors. Early identification and treatment of inherited thrombophilias can significantly improve patient outcomes by preventing recurrent thromboembolic events. 
9,7,69,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial69,Patient Information:   A 75-year-old Caucasian female was presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of a sudden shortness of breath. The patient  a retired school teacher  resides in upstate New York with her husband of 50 years. She is a non-smoker and leads a sedentary lifestyle.  Medical History:   Her past medical history is significant with hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  both under control with regular medication (metformin and amlodipine). The patient was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years back and is on statins since then. She underwent a total right knee arthroplasty two weeks prior. She denies any history of pulmonary disease  heart disease  or malignancies. There is no familial history of clotting disorders.  Findings:  When presented  patient was found to be tachycardic with a heart rate of 115 beats min  tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min  and blood pressure was 145/85 mm Hg. Oxygen saturation was a bit low at 91% on room air. Physical examination also revealed a moderately obese woman in mild distress due to dyspnea but without palpable leg edema or homan’s sign.  Investigations:  A 12-lead ECG showed sinus tachycardia with no ST changes. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest with an intravenous contrast demonstrated a large central filling defect in the right pulmonary artery  further extending to the segmental and subsegmental branches suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism (PE).   Laboratory investigations reported elevated Troponin-I levels (0.6 ng/mL) and D-Dimer levels were significantly high with a value of 3500 ng/ml. A baseline blood investigation showed elevated fasting blood glucose and lipid panel was also deranged. Hemoglobin  white blood cell count  platelets  kidney and liver function tests were within normal limits. The patient’s calculated Well’s Score was a high risk of 9 points.  Treatment and Outcome:  The patient was administered subcutaneous injections of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) for immediate anticoagulation therapy  and started on Oxygen therapy to manage dyspnea. Thrombolysis was considered considering her age  but was decided against due to the risk factors involving a recent surgical procedure. The patient's condition stabilized after 24 hours of treatment.  She was later referred to a pulmonologist and a cardiologist for further outpatient follow-up and long-term anticoagulation therapy. PE was likely caused by deep vein thrombosis post-operative due to the recent knee replacement surgery along with her sedentary lifestyle.  Ethics:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the treatment provided and for the use of her medical data for the purpose of documentation whilst maintaining her anonymity.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of considering PE in the differential diagnosis in a postoperative patient presenting with sudden dyspnea. Prompt diagnosis with stratification of risk and immediate initiation of anticoagulation therapy can significantly improve patient outcomes.

9,7,71,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial71,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 65-year-old Male Patient with Hypertension and Type 2-Diabetes: A Case Report   Introduction:  We report a case of a 65-year-old male diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism (APE). The patient has a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this case report is to highlight the intersection of various complex comorbidities with acute pulmonary embolism.  Case Description:  The 65-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with chief complaints of sudden chest pain  breathlessness  and fainting spells. He had a known medical history of poorly controlled hypertension along with type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was a non-smoker  non-alcoholic  and had a sedentary lifestyle.  On examination  his blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg  pulse rate was 110 per/min  respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Lower limb examination did not show any signs of deep venous thrombosis.  Laboratory investigations revealed a high D-dimer level of 2500 ng/mL (normal: 0-500 ng/mL). Both the complete blood count and blood chemistries were within normal limits except for an elevated fasting blood glucose level of 180 mg/dL and HbA1c of 9.2%. An ECG showed signs of right heart strain  suggestive of pulmonary embolism.  A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the diagnosis by revealing a large thrombus in the right and left pulmonary arteries. Bedside transthoracic echocardiography showed signs of right ventricular dysfunction.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was immediately managed using anticoagulation therapy  with intravenous heparin. After a period of initial stabilization  his symptoms improved  and he was transitioned to oral apixaban. His diabetes and hypertension were also simultaneously managed with metformin and amlodipine  respectively.  During follow up after four weeks  the patient had significant symptomatic relief and his conditions  including hypertension and diabetes  were under better control. A repeat CTPA showed significant reduction in the size of the thrombus.  Discussion:  This case underscores the higher likelihood of encountering acute pulmonary embolism in patients with associated comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes  which could be potential risk factors. It also highlights the importance of immediate recognition and prompt anticoagulation management  alongside concomitant management of existing comorbidities.  Conclusion:  This case report illustrates the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism as a differential  particularly in older patients presenting with sudden chest pain and breathlessness and who have a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Early diagnosis and timely initiation of anticoagulation treatment are key to positive patient outcomes. 
9,7,72,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial72,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 52-year-old Caucasian Female with Obesity and Sedentary Lifestyle  Introduction: This case involves a 52-year-old Caucasian female who presented with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest discomfort  and exertional fatigue suggestive of an Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE).  Case Presentation:   The patient  Mrs. J  was a housewife with a BMI of 30.2 characterized as 'Obese' with a history of a sedentary lifestyle  but no known history of thrombotic disease. She had a longstanding history of hypertension well-controlled with Olmesartan 20mg once daily. She does not consume alcohol  smoke cigarettes  or use recreational drugs. She had no known family history of thrombotic diseases. Her mother had a history of hypertension and father had type II diabetes  but there was no record of cardiac disease or pulmonary issues.  Two weeks prior to her hospital admission  she returned from a 12-hour long-haul flight with her husband. She was slightly immobile during the flight because she had a window seat and hesitated to disturb her husband while he was sleeping. Within a week  she began to experience shortness of breath and chest discomfort upon exertion.    On the day of admission  she presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of severe shortness of breath accompanied by sharp chest pain that increased with deep breathing. At presentation  she was tachycardic with a pulse rate of 110bpm  tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 26 cycles/min  and had oxygen saturations of 90% on room air.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  A clinical assessment suggested possible pulmonary embolism. A contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a large thrombus occluding the right pulmonary artery confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. Her D-dimer levels were significantly raised to 680 ng/mL (normal <500 ng/mL). An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed S1Q3T3 suggestive of cor pulmonale secondary to acute pulmonary thromboembolism. Ultrasonography of the lower limbs was performed to find the site of deep venous thrombosis  which revealed a clot in the right calf veins.  Therapeutic Intervention:  As soon as the diagnosis was confirmed  the patient was commenced on low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) followed by oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban  and her oxygen saturation improved to 96% on 2L nasal cannula.   Follow-up and Outcomes:  During the hospital stay  Mrs. J continued to show improvement in her symptoms over the course of a week  and her oxygen requirement weaned off. She was discharged on rivaroxaban for six months with clear instructions about follow-ups and signs of complications/thrombosis.  Discussion:  This case emphasizes the severity and potential deadliness of acute pulmonary embolism  especially in people with risk factors such as prolonged immobility  obesity  and long haul flights. Early recognition and timely intervention is pivotal in the management of such cases.   Patient Perspective:   Mrs. J acknowledges her sedentary lifestyle as a contributing factor to her condition and is grateful for the timely intervention. She is committed to positive lifestyle modifications  including exercise and weight management.  Key Learning Points:  This case study highlights that a high index of suspicion for acute pulmonary emboli should be maintained in people presenting with sudden onset dyspnea  chest discomfort  particularly if they have recently taken long-haul flights or have other predisposing factors like obesity. 
9,7,73,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial73,Patient Information: Mr. J is a 56-year-old Caucasian male with a body mass index (BMI) of 27.5. He is a non-smoker and consumes moderate quantities of alcohol. He is employed as an air traffic controller  a job that demands long hours of sitting.   Chief Complaint: The patient presented with sudden breathlessness  chest pain  and light-headedness.  History of Present Illness: Mr. J was in his usual state of health until 7 days ago when he started to experience progressive difficulty in breathing  accompanied by mild chest discomfort that exaggerated into severe chest pain which was described as ‘sharp’ and ‘stabbing.' The chest pain was also triggered on the deep inhalation. Further probing revealed that he has been feeling lightheaded intermittently.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  controlled on medication. There is no history of diabetes mellitus  coronary artery disease  or stroke. He also reported a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 10 years ago after a long-haul flight journey. He completed anticoagulation without recurrence  and there has been no family history suggestive of any clotting disorder. There has been no recent history of prolonged immobilization  surgery  or malignancy.  Investigations/Results: His initial pulse rate was 100 beats/minute and blood pressure was 130/85 mm of Hg. His oxygen saturation on room air was 94%. Laboratory results revealed a high D-dimer level. Chest X-ray was non-significant but ECG showed tachycardia. The diagnosis was confirmed with computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA)  which revealed a clot in the right pulmonary artery.   Assessment: With thorough case history  clinical findings  and investigation results  Mr. J was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism (PE).  Discussion: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of a massive PE. Given Mr. J's history of DVT and his profession requiring long periods of sitting  it indicates prolonged periods of immobility  which is a major risk factor for DVT and consequent PE. The management involves immediate anticoagulation therapy  and since he is hemodynamically stable  he was started on low-molecular-weight Heparin and oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban. The patient was advised to follow-up in one week for reevaluation.   The case not only provides an insight into the clinical presentation of acute PE but also reinforces the significance of prolonged immobility as a risk factor of PE. More studies are warranted to elucidate optimal protocols for PE patients with prior history of VTE and strategies to reduce immobility-associated risks.
9,7,74,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial74,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 68-year-old Female with History of Prolonged Immobility  Introduction:  This case report describes a 68-year old Caucasian female with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE)  with underlying risk factors including prolonged immobilization and obesity.  Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who lives in a semi-rural area  living alone with minimal assistance. She has no history of tobacco or alcohol use. She has a known history of Type II Diabetes  controlled with oral medication  and hypertension treated with Lisinopril therapy. She has no history of surgeries or hospitalizations previously.   The patient has a BMI of 30  indicating obesity  and spends most of her time immobile due to severe arthritis  which potentially puts her at risk of thromboembolic events. She takes over-the-counter NSAIDs for her arthritis pain.  Clinical Findings: The patient presented with acute onset of dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain  and a cough producing pink frothy sputum. On physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and dyspneic  vital signs showed tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm  blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air  indicating respiratory compromise.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  The ECG showed sinus tachycardia and the chest X-ray was essentially normal. A D-Dimer test was done due to the high clinical suspicion for PE  which came back significantly elevated. A subsequent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) confirmed a large clot in her right pulmonary artery  indicating acute PE.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was started on therapeutic dose subcutaneous enoxaparin with plans to bridge anticoagulation to oral warfare. Her Oxygen saturation improved with supplemental oxygen and her symptoms gradually improved over the next few days in the hospital.  Follow-Up:  In follow-up  the patient was transitioned to apixaban for long term anticoagulation after reviewing the risks and benefits. She was referred to the outpatient pulmonary clinic and physiotherapy for mobilization and rehabilitation.  Clinical Lessons/Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of risk stratification and appropriate treatment in elderly patients who have prolonged immobility and other risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Close collaboration between health care professionals in inpatient and outpatient settings is of utmost importance to prevent morbidity and mortality.

It also underscores the importance of managing underlying risk factors to prevent future incidents.
9,7,78,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial78,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information:   A 68-year old caucasian male was admitted to the emergency department with acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient holds a sedentary lifestyle in a quiet suburban community. He is a retired factory worker  a nonsmoker  and has a reported history of moderate alcohol consumption.  His medical history consists of hypertension  dyslipidemia  and Type II diabetes mellitus  all of which are managed with oral medications. He has no reported history of pulmonary diseases or cancer and no family history of thromboembolic disease. He underwent a hip replacement surgery about three weeks prior to admission  after which he had been largely immobile.   Clinical Findings:  The patient presented at rest  dyspneic and tachypneic  with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and heart rate of 108 beats/min. An EKG showed sinus tachycardia and blood tests showed a significantly elevated D-Dimer level (1500 ng/mL - normal range <500 ng/mL). His oxygen saturation was 90% on room air.  Diagnostic Assessment:  A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was ordered considering the clinical picture and elevated D-Dimer levels. It showed a large central filling defect in the right pulmonary artery indicating a large clot.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was immediately started on therapeutic anticoagulation with intravenous heparin. Further  after stabilizing the patient  systemic thrombolytic therapy was given due to the significant clot burden and the patient's hemodynamic instability.  The patient was also given oxygen therapy to maintain an oxygen saturation of over 95%.   Follow-up and Outcome:  The patient began to show considerable improvement within the following 48 hours. His dyspnea decreased and oxygen saturation levels improved to 95-97%.  After 5 days  he was transitioned to oral anticoagulants with a plan to continue for at least 3 months. He will be re-evaluated at the time to assess the necessity for further anticoagulation therapy.  Patient was discharged with a home care plan that included strict medication adherence  gradual increase in mobilization  and diet control. The importance of regular follow up was emphasized.  Learning Points:  This case highlights the need for a high degree of suspicion for pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with unexplained dyspnea  especially in the setting of relative immobility such as post-surgical states  even in the absence of traditionally known risk factors like smoking or a personal/familial history of venous thromboembolism.    It also highlights the importance of early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of pulmonary embolism to prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality.

Clinical Presentation and Timeline: The patient reported progressive chest pain for the past two hours  along with an episode of syncope. His past medical history was significant for Type II diabetes and hypertension.   Relevant Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with Type II diabetes about 10 years prior and subsequently with hypertension 7 years ago. His conditions were managed with metformin for diabetes and losartan for hypertension. Apart from occasional alcohol intake  he denied any use of tobacco or other recreational substances.  Physical Examination and Diagnostic Assessment: On arrival  he was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute and had an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. His blood pressure was 138/85 mmHg  and he was tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. His body mass index was 32 kg/m2  denoting obesity.  An ECG showed signs of acute right heart strain (S1Q3T3 pattern). Laboratory findings showed elevated D-dimer levels and mildly elevated troponins. ABG analysis found hypoxemia and a mild respiratory alkalosis.  Based on these findings  the patient was sent for computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)  which showed a large thrombus in the right pulmonary artery extending into the lobar branches. This confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.   Diagnostic Intervention and Treatment: The patient was immediately started on therapeutic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and admitted to the intensive care unit for further monitoring. Consultation with a cardiologist and hematologist was made.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was scheduled for pulmonary thromboembolectomy by the cardiology team after initial stabilization. Post operatively  the patient was kept on LMWH for three months. Gradual mobilization was initiated. Patient education was provided about the importance of a healthy lifestyle and regular exercises.  Follow-up and Outcomes: On follow-up after three months  the patient reported significant improvement in chest pain and dyspnea. His oxygen saturation had improved to 96% on room air  and repeat CTPA demonstrated resolution of previous clot burden.  Learning Points & Discussion: This case highlights the potentially fatal complication of a sedentary lifestyle and obesity in patients with chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension. It reinforces the importance of regular monitoring  lifestyle modifications  and patient education in this vulnerable population. Moreover  early diagnosis and suitable interventional management can significantly improve prognostic outcomes in acute pulmonary embolism.

9,7,81,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial81,Patient Information and Demographic: A Caucasian female  aged 57 years  presented to the emergency department. She is a nonsmoker and nonalcoholic. She lives with her family and is a high-school teacher by profession. She has no past history of drug addiction or substance abuse.   Presenting Complaint: The patient had been complaining of experiencing sudden-onset shortness of breath and sharp chest pain for 24 hours. The pain was not radiating and exacerbated by deep breathing.  Medical History: The patient has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower limb 2 years back. The condition had been managed with anticoagulants which she discontinued a year back. The only other health concern was controlled hypertension. She had no history of cancer  heart diseases  or surgeries in the past. There were no known allergies. Her family history consisted of an uncle with a pulmonary embolism.   Physical Examination: On examination  she had a body temperature of 37.8 degree Celsius  heart rate was 110 bpm  respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute  blood pressure was found to be 130/80 mm Hg  and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. She was awake and oriented but agitated due to chest pain.  Investigations: Routine blood investigation was done  a complete blood count and coagulation profile were within normal limits. D-Dimer test showed an elevated level of 600 ng/ml. ECG showed sinus tachycardia but no signs of right heart strain. Chest X-ray did not show any active lung disease. The suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism was high and thus  computerized tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was ordered  which confirmed the presence of a large clot burden in the right main pulmonary artery and its branches.   Management: Considering her history of DVT and high risk due to the large clot burden  she was initially managed with anticoagulation therapy (low molecular weight heparin). The option of thrombolysis or a pulmonary embolectomy was reserved in case of hemodynamic instability. Her clinical condition improved after anticoagulation initiation.  Discussion: The patient's previous history of DVT and discontinuation of anticoagulants coupled with the presentation of acute chest pain and shortness of breath led to a high suspicion diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. The CTPA scan confirmed the diagnosis. Due to her previous history and the large clot burden  the decision was taken to commence anticoagulation therapy immediately. The critical decision at this point was regarding aggressive measures like thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy. As the patient was hemodynamically stable and responded well to anticoagulation therapy  these invasive measures were reserved for possible future use.   The patient was discharged after five days with no signs of chest pain or difficulty in respiration. She was advised to continue the oral anticoagulant medication and regular follow up.

Other vitals included pulse -110 per minute  blood pressure - 145/95 mmHg  and oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. The cardiovascular system examination showed tachycardia with regular rhythm. The chest was bilaterally symmetrical  vesicular breath sounds with no added sounds were noted. No swelling or tenderness in the lower limbs was noticed.  Initial Laboratory Investigations: Standard blood tests were ordered  with her D-dimer levels being significantly elevated. The Chest X-ray was normal and the ECG showed a sinus tachycardia with right bundle branch block.  Diagnosis and Management: Considering her elevated D-dimer levels  history of DVT and her clinical condition  a computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered to confirm the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism. The CTA revealed multiple filling defects in both lungs consistent with PE.  She was immediately put on oxygen support via nasal cannula and started on therapeutic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin.   Disposition: Given the acute nature of her illness and as her symptoms were severe  the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring and adjustment of treatment.  Conclusion: This case reaffirms the importance of a thorough medical history in manage acute conditions  especially in patients who have got a history of DVT  given the known risk for PE. The fact that the patient was irregular with her anticoagulants might have contributed to the recurrence of thrombotic event. It is essential to continually educate patients about the risks of medication non-compliance.
9,7,83,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial83,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Middle-Aged Woman with Prior History of Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Case Report  Introduction:  This case report discusses a 45-year-old Caucasian woman with an acute episode of pulmonary embolism (PE) with previously diagnosed deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Case Report:  The patient  a 45-year-old woman with a known history of recurrent DVT  was brought to our emergency department reporting sudden shortness of breath. Associated symptoms included chest pain that worsened with deep breathing  mild dizziness  and cough with bloody sputum.  Her medical history was significant for recurrent DVT and she was on anticoagulant therapy (Rivaroxaban). She is a non-smoker  zero alcohol consumption and no history of illicit drug usage. She had a desk job with minimal physical activity and was a known case of Obesity (BMI-32). There was no family history of coagulation disorders but her mother had a history of stroke.  On clinical examination  the patient was dyspneic with respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  heart rate 105 beats per minute  blood pressure was 125/85 mmHg  and oxygen saturation was 90 percent on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia and the rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Her D-dimer levels were significantly elevated  which prompted an immediate CT scan of her chest. Imaging indicated a Large embolus lodged in the right pulmonary artery (RPA) confirming the diagnosis of acute PE.   Full blood count  comprehensive metabolic panel  coagulation profile (apart from D-dimer)  and arterial blood gases were within normal limits. Echocardiography exhibited right ventricular strain suggesting the severity of the embolism.  Treatment and Outcome:  The patient was promptly started on therapeutic heparin and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). An inferior vena cava filter was placed due to her complication of experiencing a PE despite being on anticoagulation.  Her hospital stay lasted for 10 days during which her symptoms gradually improved. The patient was discharged with advice on high mobility  weight loss  and long-term anticoagulation therapy. She was also scheduled for regular outpatient follow-ups including extensive laboratory monitoring.  Discussion:  This case highlights the importance of high clinical suspicion for PE in patients with past medical history of DVT and emphasizes the need for aggressive management in these high-risk patients. It also underscores the importance of lifestyle changes as part of the management plan for patients with a history of thromboembolic phenomenon. 
9,7,84,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial84,Patient Information:   A 63-year-old Hispanic male arrived at the emergency department via ambulance. The patient reports a sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and slight confusion; symptoms were present since he woke up in the morning. He lives with his wife and adult son  who alerted the emergency services. He is an ex-smoker  having ceased 15 years ago  and consumes alcohol in moderation. He is a retired electrician.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he has been on medication (Losartan and atorvastatin) for the past seven years. In addition  the patient had surgery to repair a hernia three weeks ago from which he was reported to be recovering well. He has no history of cardiac diseases  blood clots  disorders  or malignancy. He has obesity with a BMI of 31.9 kg/m²  and he doesn't regularly engage in physical activities. He has no known drug allergies.  Case Presentation:  Upon receiving the patient at the emergency department  the vital signs indicated tachycardia (Pulse 110 bpm)  a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute  blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg  oxygen saturation was 88% on room air  and his temperature was 37.2°C. His ECG showed sinus tachycardia with no signs of acute myocardial infarction. The physical examination didn't reveal any significant findings except for the signs of respiratory distress (use of accessory muscles  diaphoresis) and distal leg swelling.  Diagnosis & Assessment:   The patient's symptoms  history  and presentation were suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism  which was confirmed by a CT pulmonary angiogram  which demonstrated multiple clots in both pulmonary arteries. Laboratory investigations highlighted elevated D-dimer levels. The patient was sent for lower extremity venous doppler ultrasound that showed bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Treatment & Outcome:  He was immediately started on intravenous anticoagulation (heparin) and administered supplemental oxygen. Given the patient's hemodynamic stability  he was not considered a candidate for thrombolytic therapy. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and further management. His condition improved over the following days  with relief in symptoms  and he was shifted to oral anticoagulants (Rivaroxaban) for a prolonged period to prevent recurrences. After stabilization  he was discharged with advice to maintain a healthy lifestyle and continue his prescribed medications.  Follow-up:  Appointments were scheduled for follow-up visits with the patient’s primary care physician and a pulmonology specialist to monitor his condition and manage his anticoagulant therapy. An early mobilization plan was discussed to reduce the risk of further blood clot formation  as the patient had been relatively sedentary after his hernia surgery. His medications need to be consistently evaluated for dose adjustments to prevent any side effects or interactions.    This case underlines the importance of prompt recognition and management of acute pulmonary embolism  a potentially fatal condition  particularly in patients with recent surgery and prolonged immobility. It also reinforces the need for implementation of DVT prophylaxis in post-operative patients.

This study presents a case of acute PE in a 52-year-old postmenopausal woman.  Patient Information: The patient in the present case  referred to as Mr. J  is a Caucasian female  aged 52  from Milwaukee  Wisconsin. She is the mother of two children and practices as a kindergarten teacher. She has a BMI of 27 indicating overweight  non-smoker  doesn't consume alcohol  leads a moderately active lifestyle  and has no known drug allergies.  Clinical Findings: Ms. J presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden-onset dyspnea  chest pain  and palpitations. Initial vitals showed tachycardia (heart rate  118 bpm)  increased respiratory rate (22 breaths per minute)  blood pressure was 136/78 mmHg  and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 92% on room air.  Past Medical History: Ms. J has a past history of gallbladder removal surgery (cholecystectomy) 3 weeks prior to the current hospital visit. She has been postmenopausal for 2 years  with associated obesity and a family history of venous thromboembolism (mother and older brother). She also has a history of hypertension controlled with medication (Lisinopril) and has never been diagnosed with any form of heart disease or diabetes.  Clinical progression: Conventional diagnostic protocols  including D-dimer test  were conducted and returned positive. Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed small-to-medium-sized thrombi in the right and left pulmonary arteries. An electrocardiogram showed signs of right heart strain (S1Q3T3).  Treatment: Ms. J was stabilized with oxygen therapy and promptly started on intravenous heparin for anticoagulation.   Outcome & Follow-Up: She responded well to the treatment over the following days. Her chest pain and dyspnea improved  her SpO2 returned to 98% and tachycardia had eased off to 84 bpm by day 3 of admission. She remained in the hospital for observation for 5 days  was transitioned from IV Heparin to oral Rivaroxaban. She was discharged  with follow-up appointments scheduled for further assessment and to monitor response to the ongoing anticoagulation therapy.  Discussion: In patients with recent surgical interventions  PE remains a major complication  particularly in postmenopausal women. Early identification  diagnosis  and administration of anticoagulant therapy significantly reduce morbidity and mortality risk.  Patient Consent:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient to allow this report's publication.   Conclusion: This report emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion for PE in patients presenting with immediate post-operative dyspnea and chest pain  especially considering previous potential risk factors such as recent surgery  family history of VTE  post-menopausal state  and obesity.

He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases; his father suffered from a myocardial infarction  while his mother has been diagnosed with hypertension.  Past medical history: The patient has a medical history significant for chronic hypertension  which has remained under control with Lisinopril 10mg once daily. He also has obesity with a BMI of 30.3 and has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus that he manages with Metformin 500mg twice daily.  Presenting Complaints: The patient arrived at the emergency department accompanied by his wife  presenting with sudden onset dyspnea  sharp pleuritic chest pain  and lightheadedness.  Examination & Investigations: Upon examination  he was tachypneic and hypotensive (BP- 90/50 mm Hg)  with an increased heart rate (HR- 110 bpm). Oxygen saturation on room air was 89%. The laboratory report revealed an elevated serum troponin level and D-dimer. An urgent computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) demonstrated a large clot obstructing the right and left main pulmonary arteries  consistent with acute bilateral pulmonary embolism. Lower limb Doppler ultrasound also revealed deep venous thrombosis in the right lower limb  indicating the probable source of the emboli.  Clinical Course: The patient was immediately given a bolus of intravenous unfractionated heparin followed by a continuous infusion. An inferior vena cava filter was placed for prevention of further embolic events. During his hospitalization  his dyspnea gradually improved and his vital signs stabilized.  Discussion: This case demonstrates acute pulmonary embolism in a patient with multiple risk factors namely  chronic hypertension  obesity  and type 2 diabetes  creating a hypercoagulable state. His family history of cardiovascular disease further underscored his risk profile. Early recognition and immediate anticoagulation were critical to improving his prognosis.  Conclusion: The high index of suspicion for pulmonary embolism and timely initiation of anticoagulation was key to the favorable clinical outcome in this case. This case also highlights the need for early recognition of the thrombotic risk profile in patients with similar comorbidities and lifestyle factors.

9,7,88,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial88,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 55-Year-Old Female: A Case Report  Introduction:   We report a case of acute pulmonary embolism in a 55-year-old Caucasian female patient  who presented with sudden chest pain  shortness of breath and fainting.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian female  non-smoker  with a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and had undergone a total right knee replacement six weeks prior to the presentation. She had been otherwise healthy until six hours before admission when she experienced sudden-onset chest pain. The pain was described as dull  continuous  and located in the substernal area. This was also associated with shortness of breath  light-headedness  and one episode of syncope.   The patient denied any recent trauma  long-duration travel  family or personal history of blood clot disorders. She was on regular medications for her hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and had been prescribed a prophylactic daily dose of low-molecular-weight heparin following her knee replacement operation.  Upon examination  blood pressure was 105/70 mmHg  heart rate was 120 beats per minute  respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 90% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia but no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Respiratory exam disclosed decreased breath sounds on the lower lung fields bilaterally. Lower limbs were symmetric with no edema or warmth.  An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia with right bundle branch block and S1Q3T3 pattern. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. D-dimer level was significantly elevated. Due to the high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism  a computed tomographic angiogram of the chest was performed  revealing bilateral pulmonary emboli.   The patient was treated with thrombolytics and she was started on therapeutic anticoagulation therapy  with significant improvement in her oxygenation and symptoms over the next several hours. The hospital's multidisciplinary team was involved in her care  suggesting the cause of pulmonary embolism could be postoperative immobility along with her non-modifiable risk (age) and modifiable risk factors (hypertension and hyperlipidemia). Strategies were put in place for optimal medical management  physiotherapy  and future prevention.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the complex and serious nature of acute pulmonary embolism  especially in postoperative patients with other risk factors. It emphasizes the importance of swift diagnosis and treatment  as well as the critical role of preventive strategies in at-risk patients.
9,7,89,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial89,Patient Information  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the Emergency Department complaining of sudden onset of severe dyspnea  chest pain  and episodes of fainting. He resides in a community in Northern California  retired  and lives with his wife. He denies smoking but concedes to drinking alcohol socially. He admits to a sedentary lifestyle since retirement.  Medical History  The patient has a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are being controlled with medication. He denies any history of diabetes mellitus  pulmonary disease  or cardiovascular diseases. The patient also reports he underwent a total hip replacement surgery 6 weeks prior to this current episode  following which he was bedbound for an extended period of time. There is no known history of deep venous thrombosis  bleeding disorder  atrial fibrillation  or malignancy. He is currently administered Lisinopril for hypertension and Simvastatin for high cholesterol levels.  Investigations and Diagnosis  The patient's vitals revealed a blood pressure of 138/85 mmHg  heart rate of 107 bpm  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. His ECG showed sinus tachycardia without any signs of myocardial ischemia. Chest radiography didn’t reveal any acute cardiopulmonary abnormality  and there were no abnormalities detected on physical examination.   Due to his symptoms and recent immobility following surgery  a suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE) was raised. A D-dimer test was ordered and came out significantly high  suggesting possible blood clot formation. Subsequently  a computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan was performed and confirmed the presence of a large clot in the right pulmonary artery confirming the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment and Follow-up  Immediately  the patient was started on intravenous heparin  following which his symptoms started to improve. A follow-up echocardiogram revealed mild right ventricular dilation  but there were no signs of severe right heart strain. Further screening for thrombophilia and malignancy were done  of which all results came out normal.  The patient was transitioned to oral anticoagulant therapy with rivaroxaban before being discharged. He was instructed to regularly follow-up with his primary care physician  with strict instructions for medication compliance.  Outcome  The patient’s recovery was uncomplicated  and after 3-months follow-up  he was symptom-free with normalized D-dimer levels. He will continue on anticoagulation therapy for additional 3 months considering his risk factors and will continue for lifelong if any recurrent events.  Take-Home Message  This case highlights the importance of considering a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with sudden onset dyspnea  especially with risk factors like recent surgery or prolonged immobilization. Early diagnosis and immediate treatment significantly impact the prognosis in such cases.

Discussion: This case highlights the importance of considering Acute Pulmonary Embolism as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting to the emergency department with unexplained chest pain and shortness of breath. Following correct diagnosis  immediate initiation of the anticoagulant therapy can prove life-saving – as evidenced in this patient's gradual recovery. 
9,7,99,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial99,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in A 73-Year-Old Female Patient  Patient Information ------ The patient is a 73-year-old Caucasian female  retired  with a body mass index (BMI) of 28.6.  Chief Complaint ------ The patient was brought to the emergency department complaining of sudden difficulty in breathing  chest pain and coughing up blood.  History of Present Illness ------ The patient woke up with a sudden onset of chest pain  shortness of breath  and coughing up blood  which progressively worsened over the course of a few hours. The chest pain was intense and stabbing  intensified with deep breaths and did not radiate to any other area. The cough was dry but later had hemoptysis.  Previous Medical History ------ The patient has a documented history of diabetes mellitus type 2 for which she has been on Metformin  hypertension that has been managed with Lisinopril  and mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for which she uses an inhaler as needed. She has never smoked in her life. The patient had a fractured hip about two months prior to presentation that required surgical intervention followed by prolonged bed rest.  Physical Examination ------ At the time of presentation  the patient was acutely distressed with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute  blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg  a pulse of 120 beats per minute  and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air which improved to 92% with the use of 2 liters of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Chest auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds on the left side. She did not have any leg swelling  redness or warmth.  Diagnostic Assessment ------ Given her recent immobilization  respiratory symptoms  and physical examination results  a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was suspected. A CT angiography was immediately ordered  which confirmed an acute pulmonary embolism in the left main pulmonary artery. The D-dimer levels were also elevated  suggesting high clot burden.   Therapeutic Intervention ------ The patient was admitted to the ICU and started on intravenous heparin for immediate anticoagulation. After stabilization  she was transferred to the medical ward and switched to oral anticoagulants. The dosage was carefully adjusted keeping in view her renal function and risk of bleeding.   Follow-Up and Outcomes ------ The patient tolerated the treatment well with a significant improvement in her symptoms. Her oxygen saturation level remained stable on room air  and no active bleeding was observed. She was discharged on the fifth day of hospitalization  with arrangements for at-home nursing care and follow-ups at the anticoagulation clinic. Patient’s family was educated about the signs of possible complications like bleeding and instructed to bring her for immediate medical attention if symptoms recur.  Patient Perspective ------ The patient expressed anxiety about her condition  but understood the importance of adherence to her medication to prevent future events.  Lessons from the case ------ This case illustrates the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis when a patient with recently immobilized condition presents with unexplained acute chest pain  breathlessness  and hemoptysis. It reminds health practitioners to keep in mind that a PE can occur in non-smoking patients with COPD and that age  recent surgery  and bed rest are all risk factors for PE. 
9,7,100,diagnosis9-prompt7-trial100,Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a 54-year-old Female with No Previous Cardiopulmonary Disease  Introduction: This case report describes a patient with acute pulmonary embolism with no prior history of cardiopulmonary disease or other predisposing factors.  Case Presentation: The patient is a 54-year-old African-American female  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset dyspnea  chest pain  and palpitations lasting for over three hours. She reported no past medical history of cardiopulmonary diseases  hypercoagulable state  nor any recent travels or surgeries. She is a non-smoker with no recreational drug use. She consumes alcohol socially and has a BMI of 24.7 (Normal BMI: 18.5-24.9 kg/m2). She has a family history of hypertension on the maternal and paternal side but no history of cardiovascular diseases or venous thromboembolism.  Clinical Findings: On presentation  she was tachycardic with a heart rate of 111 beats per minute  blood pressure of 137/85 mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Physical examination revealed an anxious woman in moderate respiratory distress. Heart examination revealed tachycardia with regular rhythm  no murmurs  rubs or gallops. Lung exam showed decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes bilaterally  but it was otherwise clear. Her extremities were warm with trace edema bilaterally  no evidence of deep vein thrombosis was observed. Rest of the physical exam was unremarkable.   Investigations: Complete blood count  Kidney function tests  Liver function tests  and COVID-19 RT-PCR came back within normal limits. Her electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with no ST or T wave changes. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. A high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast showed filling defects in the bilateral pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary embolism. Her D-dimer level was elevated  and her Wells score was calculated to be 4.5 (moderate probability of pulmonary embolism).  Treatment: Patient was treated immediately with low-molecular-weight Heparin and given supplemental oxygen. No thrombolytics were required as patient was hemodynamically stable.  Outcome and Follow-up: The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for close monitoring. Her dyspnea and tachycardia improved within 24 hours. She was transitioned to Warfarin for long term anticoagulation therapy  aiming for an INR of 2-3.  Conclusion: This case highlights the fact that acute pulmonary embolism can occur even in individuals with no prior cardiopulmonary disease. Prompt diagnosis and immediate treatment are crucial in managing such patients. It also underscores the importance of high clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with unexplained dyspnea. The patient's family was advised to undergo thrombophilia screening considering the unprovoked nature of the event.

He had an appendectomy at the age of 20 and a coronary angioplasty 3 years ago. His medications include Aspirin  Simvastatin  Lisinopril and Metformin.  Family History:  There's a significant family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of a heart attack at the age of 62  and his mother had a stroke in her 70s but survived. His only sibling  a younger sister  has chronic atrial fibrillation.  Presentation:  This time  Mr. G reported an acute onset of sharp  right-sided chest pain which was exacerbated on deep inspiration. He also reported severe dyspnea  light-headedness  and palpitations. No signs of hemoptysis or lower limb edema were reported.  Assessment:  On examination  he was observed to be in distress  his vital signs demonstrated tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.  The lab reports showed a slightly elevated D-dimer and troponin level. His ECG showed sinus tachycardia with no specific ST-T wave changes. CT Pulmonary Angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism  showing clot in the right pulmonary artery.   Plan:  With the diagnosis confirmed  Mr. G was immediately started on intravenous heparin and given supplemental oxygen. Given his comorbid conditions and history  pulmonary embolism's decision for long-term anticoagulation and potential inferior vena cava filter placement will be considered in further discussion with a multidisciplinary team.  This case highlights the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis of sudden-onset chest pain and dyspnea. Additionally  it emphasizes the role of individual patient factors such as Mr. G's sedentary lifestyle  smoking history  and significant family history of cardiovascular diseases in the development of this acute condition.
9,9,2,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial2,Patient Presentation: Mr. Robert Adams  a 69-year-old Caucasian male.  Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath and mild chest pain persisting for the past two days.  Past Medical History: Mr. Adams has a history of hypertension and was diagnosed with Type II diabetes five years ago. Both conditions are managed with medication (Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension). Also  he suffered a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) event about three years ago. He's a former smoker (30 pack-years) and quit 10 years ago. He occasionally imbibes alcohol.  Family History: His father passed away from a myocardial infarction at age 75; his mother had a history of obesity  diabetes  and hypertension and passed away at age 78. He has a younger sister who is alive and healthy.  Current Presentation: Mr. Adams came to the emergency department presenting shortness of breath  mild chest pain  and a cough. Upon examination  he was found to be tachypneic and slightly tachycardic with oxygen saturation of 89% on room air. The chest was clear on auscultation.  Investigations: His blood investigation showed an elevated D Dimer level and a chest CT scan showed multiple small peripheral pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.  Management Plan: He was immediately started on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) followed by oral anticoagulation medication (Warfarin). Mr. Adams was counseled about the importance of medication adherence to prevent PE recurrence and potential complications.  Follow-up: He will be followed up in the clinic in a week to assess his symptoms and  if needed  adjust medications. Lifestyle modification guidance  including a healthy diet and exercise to manage his diabetes and blood pressure  was also recommended.  Overall  Mr. Adams' case represents the typical risk factors and presenting symptoms for a pulmonary embolism. His history of DVT  older age  diabetes  and hypertension are significant risk factors for PE. Moreover  his ex-smoking status may also contribute to his risk. As a preventive measure  consideration should be given to prophylactic anticoagulation therapy  particularly as Mr. Adams also has a family history of cardiovascular disease.
9,9,3,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial3,Patient Case Presentation  Summary:  The patient  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the hospital with a Chief Complaint of sudden onset of dyspnea  or shortness of breath  and sharp chest pain for a period of about 6 hours. The patient also reported a lightheaded feeling and rapid heartbeat.   Past Medical History:  The patient carries a diagnosis of hypertension  hyperlipidemia and chronic atrial fibrillation. His medications include Warfarin  a blood thinner  for atrial fibrillation  and Lisinopril for hypertension. The atrial fibrillation had been relatively well controlled until this event. Also  the patient has a history of smoking approximately 20 cigarettes per day for the past 40 years and remains a current smoker. There are no past records of any surgeries.   Family History:  The patient has a family history of cardiac disease in the father who had a Myocardial Infarction at the age of 65.  Social History:  The patient was an executive for an insurance company before retiring. He is married with two adult children. The patient drinks alcohol occasionally and is a smoker.  Examination & Investigation:  On physical examination  his blood pressure was slightly elevated at 145/90 mmHg. His heart rate was tachycardic at 110 beats per minute. Oxygen saturation was low at 90% on room air. Despite some limited ability on auscultation due to obesity  the lung fields were clear.   Investigation results from a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the presence of a large embolus in the right pulmonary artery. His D-dimer blood test was significantly elevated. The EKG showed an irregular heart rhythm typical of atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate. There were no specific findings suggestive of myocardial infarction. The echocardiogram displayed elevated pulmonary artery pressure  suggesting strain due to the embolus.  Treatment & Discharge:  The patient was started on intravenous Heparin initially followed by Rivaroxaban  a type of blood thinner  once he was stabilized. The prescription was given for long-term anticoagulation with Rivaroxaban  and his Warfarin was discontinued. The patient was referred to the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program and encouraged to closely follow his blood pressure and lipid management plan. He was also asked to enroll in a smoking cessation program.  Follow Up:  It was recommended that the patient have a follow-up appointment in the hospital's anticoagulation clinic for monitoring of his new medication. Continual appointments with Pulmonary and Cardiology were also recommended to monitor his long-term progress.
9,9,4,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial4,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 62-year-old African-American male who presented to the emergency department with acute onset of shortness of breath  which started approximately two hours before his arrival. The patient also described an associated chest pain  which was pleuritic in nature  and cough with mild hemoptysis.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Johnson has a pertinent history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) around 9 years ago  which was successfully managed with anticoagulation therapy. He is hypertensive and has been stable on his medication (Lisinopril). He also has Type 2 diabetes mellitus well controlled with Metformin.  Family History:  Mr. Johnson has an older brother and sister. Both have hypertension and his brother has a history of DVT as well. His parents are both deceased; his father had a history of coronary artery disease  and his mother had Type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.  Social History:   Retired military officer leading a generally sedentary lifestyle. He smokes a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years. He is a social drinker and denies any previous or current illicit drug use.  Emergency Department Assessment:  On arrival  the patient was tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 bpm  blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min  and SpO2 of 92% on room air. His body mass index (BMI) count was 29 and was afebrile. Auscultation of lungs revealed normal breath sounds  and the cardiovascular examination was unremarkable.  The patient underwent a series of diagnostic tests. The results of the D-dimer test were elevated  prompting the need for a contrast CT  which confirmed the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism.   This patient with a history of DVT presenting with characteristic symptoms and high D-dimer levels was confirmed with CT to have a pulmonary embolism. He was admitted for therapeutic anticoagulation and further management. A detailed risk-factor analysis was initiated  and smoking cessation and lifestyle modification counseling were also planned.  Mr. Johnson's case represents the typical features of acute pulmonary embolism  reminding us of the importance of considering such a diagnosis in any patient with unexplained dyspnea  chest pain  or hemoptysis  especially in the presence of risk factors such as personal and family history of DVT or PE  and smoking.
9,9,5,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial5,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J.K. is a 70-year-old Caucasian man with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). He presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath.   Past Medical History:  Mr. J.K. has a significant past medical history that includes hypertension  diabetes  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has had two previous instances of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He quit smoking about a year ago following his more recent DVT episode.  Personal and Family History:  Mr. JK is recently widowed  lives alone  and has a daughter who lives nearby. He has a relatively sedentary lifestyle. His family history reveals that his brother died at an early age from a pulmonary embolism and his mother had recurrent DVT.   Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis:  On examination in the ED  Mr. J.K. was in acute distress  with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation 92% on room air and blood pressure of 140/85mmHg. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia. Given the clinical manifestations and his past medical history  suspicion for acute PE was high.   He was immediately started on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)  while maintaining a high level of suspicion due to his previous history of DVT. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was done immediately  which confirmed the diagnosis of acute PE.  Management:  Mr. J.K. was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. His anticoagulation was bridged to warfarin  while the LMWH was continued until the INR was therapeutic.   Given his history of previous DVT  his case was discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting with consultants from Pulmonology  Cardiology  and Hematology for considering lifetime anticoagulation to prevent further thromboembolic events.   On day 2  his symptoms improved and on day 5  he was discharged home with a comprehensive plan of care that included warfarin for long-term anticoagulation  as well as a referral to a respiratory rehabilitation program to increase his overall fitness level.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of considering a diagnosis of PE in patients with sudden onset of breathlessness  particularly in those with risk factors such as prior history of DVT. Early recognition and immediate initiation of anticoagulation therapy can significantly improve patient outcomes. It also emphasizes the value of individualizing patient care and considering long-term anticoagulation in patients with recurrent DVT or PE.
9,9,6,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial6,Patient Information: Mr. Johnson  a 62-year-old African-American male  visited the emergency department with acute shortness of breath and chest pain.   Medical History: Before presentation  Mr. Johnson had a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is a non-smoker but has a record of moderate alcohol intake. Mr. Johnson reported that he has been largely sedentary  especially after an ankle fracture six weeks ago. He had been well until a week ago when he started presenting symptoms like fatigue  increased heart rate  and insufficient breath.  Family History: Father deceased due to myocardial infarction at 70 years old. Mother  85  diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but otherwise healthy. No siblings. One son who is healthy.

His body mass index is 28.5 kg/m2  indicating that he is overweight. On clinical examination  the patient appeared distressed  but the chest was clear to auscultation  and the heart sounds were regular without murmurs.   Workup & Diagnosis: Given the clinical presentation  immediate blood tests and imaging were requested. A D-dimer test was ordered  showing high levels suggestive of a clot. In addition  an echocardiogram showed evidence of right ventricular strain. A CT Pulmonary Angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.   Management: The patient was immediately anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparin. Considering the patient’s age  comorbidities  and clot burden  he was admitted to the medical ICU for close monitoring. The case will be discussed with the multidisciplinary PERT (Pulmonary Embolism Response Team). Counseling was done regarding the importance of mobility  adequate hydration  and the avoidance of alcohol. Furthermore  the importance of compliance with the prescribed anticoagulant was stressed.   On the second day of admission  given his stability and improvement in symptoms  he was transferred to the medical floor and bridged to oral anticoagulation with Rivaroxaban  a factor Xa inhibitor. Full anticoagulation will be for 3 months  followed by re-evaluation for the potential risks and benefits of long-term anticoagulation.  Summary: A suspected case of acute pulmonary embolism was confirmed in a 62-year-old hypertensive  diabetic  overweight  sedentarily living male patient with recent immobilization due to fracture. The patient was stabilized and expected to recover with appropriate management. Education was enforced concerning risk factors and preventing recurrence. A follow-up visit is scheduled for further evaluation and management.

9,9,13,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial13,Patient's Introduction:  Mr Amir  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness. The patient's main concern was his rapid heart rate and his difficulty in taking a full breath.   Patient's Background:  Mr Amir is a retired banker residing in New York with his wife. He is a former smoker who quit five years ago but has previously smoked 20 cigarettes a day for about 30 years. He is teetotaler with no history of drug abuse. He reportedly maintains a sedentary lifestyle  with very little physical exercise. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia controlled with medication (metoprolol and rosuvastatin respectively). His parents both had coronary artery disease. His father died of myocardial infarction at age 70 and his mother had a stroke at the age of 75.  Current Admission:  On examination  Mr Amir appeared breathless and diaphoretic. His heart rate was tachycardic at 120 beats per minute  blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  respiratory rate was elevated (25 breaths per minute)  oxygen saturation was 92% on room air and his body mass index was raised at 31. His chest examination revealed clear lung fields with no additional sounds.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Blood tests levels showed a significantly raised D-dimer level. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) displayed tachycardia with no specific ST segment changes or Q waves. Based on these initial investigations and suggestive symptoms a working diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE) was made. This diagnosis was affirmed by a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)  which showed a large clot in the right main pulmonary artery.   Conclusion:  Mr Amir's case is a representation of a common  serious medical condition that can present in many different ways. This case highlights the importance of considering acute pulmonary embolism as a potential diagnosis in patients presenting with sudden onset of dyspnea  especially in those with risk factors such as advanced age  sedentary lifestyle  and a history of smoking.   Mr Amir was started on anticoagulation therapy in line with current treatment guidelines for APE. His oxygen delivery was supported until he no longer showed signs of hypoxemia  ensuring a regular follow up and advice regarding lifestyle modifications which include an increased physical activity  dietary changes  and dedicated smoking cessation (in case of relapses). With these measures in place  he has a good prognosis.
9,9,14,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial14,Patient Information:  Mr. X is a 58-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of chest pain and difficulty breathing. He was at rest when the pain began and it is localized to the middle of his chest with no radiation. Accompanying symptoms include sweating  palpitations and a feeling of impending doom.  History of Present Illness:  Prior to presentation  the patient was in his usual state of health. The onset of symptoms began two hours before he arrived at the ER. He denies any similar episodes in the past. He has had a deep  cough productive with clear sputum for the past couple of weeks  which he attributed to a common cold. He also noted recent swelling in his right lower extremity which he had ignored.  Past Medical History:  Mr. X is known hypertensive for 10 years and has hyperlipidemia. He continues to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day despite his 40-year history of smoking. He has a sedentary lifestyle and his body mass index classifies him as obese. He travels frequently for work  often with long intercontinental flights.  Family History:  His father had a stroke at age 50 and his mother has type II diabetes mellitus. He has two siblings both of whom are hypertensive. His older brother  aged 62  has a history of deep vein thrombosis.  Physical Examination:  During assessment  he was oriented to time  place  and person but appeared anxious. His blood pressure was 150/90 mm Hg  his pulse was 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation was 92% on room air  and temperature was 37°C. His right lower leg was swollen and tender. His cardiovascular and respiratory examination revealed a tachycardia with clear lung fields.  Impression:  Considering his symptoms of chest pain  shortness of breath  the recent onset lower limb swelling  and his risk factors such as long distance air travel  sedentary lifestyle and smoking; Mr. X was suspected to have an acute pulmonary embolism (PE).  Plan:  In the emergency room  he was given supplemental oxygen  placed on telemetry  and venous access was established. After securing his airway  initial blood tests including complete blood count  clotting profile  troponin  and D-dimer were ordered  and an ECG and chest X-ray were urgently performed. A CT pulmonary angiography was done which confirmed the diagnosis of acute PE. Mr. X was started on anticoagulation therapy and admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. His case was also discussed with the interventional radiology team for possible intervention  if needed. Smoking cessation counseling was recommended. A plan for an ultrasound of leg veins was made to confirm deep vein thrombosis.
9,9,15,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial15,Patient Presentation:  John Doe  a 57-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain  which was described as sharp and worsened on deep inspiration. He was accompanied by his wife who stated that the symptoms occurred suddenly while they were having dinner. There was no reported history of trauma prior to the onset of symptoms.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has been battling type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 15 years. Apart from this  he has a known diagnosis of hypertension and dyslipidemia. The patient rarely exercises and his diet is high in fats and sugars.  Family History:  Mr. Doe is a non-smoker and social drinker. His family history is significant for coronary artery disease; his father had a heart attack at the age of 60. His sister is also type 2 diabetes mellitus positive.  Clinical Examination:  On evaluation  Mr. Doe was found to be slightly tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. His blood pressure was slightly elevated at 145/90 mm Hg. On auscultation  no obvious abnormalities were found in the lungs and heart.  Initial Diagnostic Impression:  Given the sudden onset of symptoms and his clinical condition  acute pulmonary embolism was suspected.  Investigations:  Immediate D-dimer test was undertaken  which came back positive. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was subsequently ordered  which confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Discussion:  Mr. Doe’s sedentary lifestyle  poor diet  and family history of cardiovascular disease put him at an increased risk for developing clots  leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism  especially with ongoing comorbidities like type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Immediate management steps were initiated with oxygen supplement and anticoagulation therapy in the form of low molecular weight Heparin  as well as counseling on dietary modifications and the importance of exercise.  In general  acute pulmonary embolism is a potentially life-threatening condition which requires prompt diagnosis and management. It’s often difficult to diagnose because of its nonspecific clinical presentation. The risk factors include prolonged immobilization  surgery  malignancy  pregnancy  and hormonal therapy. Hence  a high degree of clinical suspicion remains an important aspect for early detection of this condition. Mr. Doe was admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring and further management. His case serves as an important reminder to consider PE in patients with sudden-onset dyspnea  especially when the clinical context fits.
9,9,16,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial16,Patient Introduction and Demographics:  The patient is a 45-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith  who works as an IT specialist and lives alone in an urban area. He is divorced with no children  a non-smoker with a sedentary lifestyle  has no drug allergies  and is known to consume alcohol socially. His family history includes a late father with coronary artery disease and a late mother with colorectal cancer.  Complaints and Symptoms:  Mr. Smith was rushed into the ER after presenting with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and coughing with some blood-tinged sputum. His chest pain was described as sharp and persistent. It worsened with deep breathing and he also had a slight fever. The symptoms started a few hours before the consultation.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith is obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30.2. He was diagnosed with Stage 1 hypertension 3 years ago and has been on antihypertensive medication. He had undergone surgery for an ingrown toenail 10 days prior to his current presentation. His medical history did not feature any significant respiratory or cardiovascular diseases.  Examinations:  Initial vital signs showed tachypnea  tachycardia  and decreased saturation of oxygen. CBC showed elevated white blood cells. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a sinus tachycardia with S1Q3T3 pattern. The D-dimer test was positive.  Diagnosis:  Acute Pulmonary Embolism was diagnosed based on his clinical presentation and results of investigations. This condition was likely secondary to post-operative immobilization leading to deep vein thrombosis and subsequent embolization.  Treatment:  He was given oxygen therapy immediately to alleviate hypoxia. He was given anticoagulants to stop further clotting and thrombolytics to dissolve existing clots.   Progress:  Mr. Smith’s considerably improved however further investigations such as CT angiography of the chest and Doppler Ultrasonography of the lower limbs were advised for confirmation of diagnosis and to ascertain the source of the embolism. After his discharge  Mr. Smith was advised regular follow-ups and encouraged to embrace a more active lifestyle to combat his obesity and sedentary habits.   It is advisable to provide genetic counseling considering his family history. Lifestyle modifications and management of his hypertension were also emphasized to reduce his risk of cardiovascular events in the future.   This case presentation demonstrates how imperative it is for healthcare providers to encourage lifestyle modifications and monitor patients who have undergone recent surgery and are at risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
9,9,17,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial17,Patient Information: Ms. Clarke  a 65-year-old Caucasian female with a known history of fibrinogenemia (an inherited blood clotting disorder) and hypertension  presented to the emergency department with acute onset shortness of breath  mild chest pain  and a cough productive of blood-tinged sputum.  History of Present Illness: The patient reports she was at home this morning when she suddenly began to feel shortness of breath and experienced mild chest pain which she rated as a 4/10. Ms. Clarke also mentioned noticing blood-tinged sputum when she coughed  subsequent to the chest pain. She denied any history of travel or prolonged periods of immobilization.  Past Medical History: Ms. Clarke has a known history of fibrinogenemia and hypertension managed with Lisinopril. She had undergone a total knee replacement 6 months ago. She is a non-smoker and lives a moderately active lifestyle.  Family History: Her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with her mother dying from a stroke at the age of 70 and her brother diagnosed with coronary artery disease in his early 60s.  Physical Examination: On arrival  she was anxious  diaphoretic and tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air  blood pressure of 175/90 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. She had decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung fields and appeared mildly cyanotic.  Diagnostic Tests: An EKG showed sinus tachycardia. A CT angiogram of the chest demonstrated a large filling defect in the left pulmonary artery  characteristic of a pulmonary embolism. Her D-dimer levels were elevated at 800 ng/ml (normal value  0-500 ng/ml)  while cardiac enzymes were found within normal ranges.  Management and Progression: Ms. Clarke was promptly initiated on intravenous heparin  with a plan to bridge to Coumadin for long term anticoagulation. Given her history of hypertension  blood pressure has been carefully managed. Subsequent days showed improvement in her shortness of breath and resolution of chest pain. The patient tolerated the therapy well.  Plan: Ms. Clarke will continue her therapy and will be carefully monitored. She will be provided a complete patient education about the nature of her condition  importance of compliance to medication  lifestyle modifications  and signs of possible complications to look out for. Genetic counseling and testing were suggested for her children and regular follow-ups with Respiratory Medicine and Cardiology have been arranged.    This case demonstrates the significant role of inherited clotting disorders in the development of pulmonary embolism in patients even without established risk factors such as immobilization or recent surgery. It underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis  and effective management in these to prevent morbidity and mortality.
9,9,18,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial18,Patient Description:  A 65-year-old Caucasian female presents to the hospital with symptoms of chest pain  shortness of breath  and coughing. The patient has been experiencing these symptoms for the past two days. She has also noted hemoptysis (coughing up blood). The patient's vitals are stable  but she presents with tachycardia (heart rate: 110 bpm) and tachypnea (respiratory rate: 24 bpm).  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of atrial fibrillation and is on warfarin for the same. She was hospitalized last year for a bout of pneumonia. She also has a diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension that are managed with oral medications. She has never smoked but has moderate alcohol consumption.  Family History: Her mother died from breast cancer  and her father had a stroke. There is no reported history of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis in the family.  Clinical Evaluation and Diagnosis: Upon physical examination  there were no notable abnormalities. However  due to the patient's reported symptoms and history of atrial fibrillation  an electrocardiogram was obtained  showing signs of right heart strain. Following this  a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed  revealing a clot in the right pulmonary artery indicating acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE).   Treatment and Follow-up: The patient was promptly initiated on therapeutic heparin. Given her overall stable condition  a decision was made to continue on the therapeutic anticoagulation and monitor her closely. The patient's warfarin was held temporarily  and she was admitted to the hospital for close surveillance. The patient was educated on the signs and symptoms of PE exacerbation and was instructed to return to the hospital immediately if symptoms worsen. On follow-up appointments  the patient showed resolution of her symptoms and the anticoagulation therapy was reviewed and restarted with increased vigilance.   The case reflects the importance of clinical suspicion in a patient with risk factors experiencing symptoms suggestive of a pulmonary embolism. In this case  early diagnosis and management possibly prevented a significant deterioration in the patient's condition. This case also underlines the need for stringent control and monitoring of anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.

9,9,20,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial20,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  referred to as Mr. A  presenting with symptoms of acute shortness of breath and chest pain. He is a retired banker  married with two adult children. His past medical history includes controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both managed by medication for the past ten years. He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. He denies any illicit drug use. There is no notable family history of respiratory diseases  but his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 70.  Presentation of Symptoms:  Mr. A's symptoms started abruptly with chest discomfort radiating to his left upper arm. The pain progressively worsened  becoming sharp and stabbing in nature when he took deep breaths. Along with this  he also noticed sudden onset of breathlessness. There were no associated symptoms like fever  productive cough  or hemoptysis.  Findings:  Upon physical examination  Mr. A was anxious  sweating  and using accessory muscles for breathing. His vital signs were: respiratory rate 22 breaths/min  heart rate 120 beats/min  blood pressure 150/90 mmHg  oxygen saturation 91% on ambient air and temperature was normal. Cardiac examination revealed tachycardia but no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. Similarly  pulmonary auscultation showed decreased breath sounds on the right lower chest  but no wheezes or crackles were noted. Abdomen and neurological examinations were unremarkable.  Investigations:  An urgent D-dimer test was ordered and it came back significantly elevated. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia with no signs of myocardial ischemia. Due to the pattern of his presenting symptoms and the findings of his D-dimer test  a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was promptly performed which confirmed bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Management and Outcome:  Given the acute pulmonary embolism diagnosis  the patient was treated with anticoagulant therapy. He was administered low molecular weight Heparin (LMWH) as bridging therapy in combination with a new oral anticoagulant. His symptoms began to improve with the treatment. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism were analyzed - recent immobilization or surgery  malignancy  or an inherited thrombophilic disorder - but none were found. After 5 days  he was discharged home with advice to continue oral anticoagulation and arrangements were made for regular follow-ups in the outpatient clinic.  Conclusion:  This case highlights that a high index of suspicion for pulmonary embolism should be maintained in patients presenting with shortness of breath and unexplained chest pain even in the absence of other risk factors. Prompt diagnosis and immediate initiation of anticoagulation treatment are critical in preventing potential fatality.
9,9,21,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial21,Patient Information  - Name: J. Smith - Age: 61 years old - Sex: Male - Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired engineer  Presenting Problem:  J. Smith presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath and mildly sharp chest pain that began earlier this morning. He reported that he has had no cough  no bloody or abnormal sputum  and swift deterioration in his capacity to perform moderate exercise.  Medical History:  J. Smith has a history of hypertension (Controlled with Lisinopril) and hypercholesterolemia (maintained with Atorvastatin). In addition  patient had a total knee replacement 6 months ago. The surgery was uneventful and he recovered well. He is a non-smoker and moderately drinks alcohol.  Family History:  His father deceased due to a myocardial infarction in his early 70s and mother had stroke  lived to 90. He has no siblings.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  J. Smith was anxious and tachycardic with a weak rapid pulse (115/minute)   elevated blood pressure of 140/90mmHg  and slightly tachypneic (22/minute)  but his temperature was within the normal range.  His oxygen saturation was hovering around 88% on room air. The respiratory examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the lower lobe of the right lung. Remainder of physical examination was pretty unremarkable.   Lab Testing:  His arterial blood gas analysis was slight hypoxemia and hypocarbia  which screamed an elevated A-a gradient. The D-Dimer test results were positive. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with an occasional extra beat but no classic S1Q3T3 pattern for Pulmonary embolism.   Investigations and Results:  A CT pulmonary angiogram was arranged that confirmed the diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (APE)  showing filling defects within the pulmonary artery branches supplying the right lower lobe.  Discussion:  In Mr. Smith's case  the pulmonary embolism likely arose due to the deep vein thrombosis caused post orthopedic surgery. His knee surgery 6 months ago as well as his inactive and sedentary life style may have added in developing a Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) that subsequently traveled up to his lung circulation.  Plan/Therapeutic Intervention:  Prompt therapeutic anticoagulation was initiated with low molecular weight Heparin (LMWH). After 5 days  he was transitioned to oral anticoagulant (Apixaban) for long-term use. Ambulation and graduated compression stockings were suggested as preventive measures for DVT formation. Scheduled for follow-up chest imaging and on dual therapy (Anticoagulant + Statin). He was educated about the symptoms of bleeding (a side effect of anticoagulant therapy) and was advised to come to the hospital if these occur. Thorough lifestyle modifications and regular follow-ups were advised.   Prognosis:  The prognosis for Mr. Smith looks decent as the embolism was diagnosed and treated quickly. With lifestyle modifications and appropriate medication  he may have a very good chance of living a normal life. Regular monitoring of vitals and routine checkups will be needed. Mr. Smith shows an encouraging spirit towards a healthy lifestyle changes.
9,9,22,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial22,Patient Information:   Mr. James Hughes  a 67-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department.  Reason for Visit:   Mr. Hughes was experiencing sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  cough  and light-headedness. His symptoms started while at home and progressively worsened within a few hours.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Hughes is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  but with a 40 pack-year smoking history. He has been managing hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past seven years with medication  with a recent HbA1c level of 6.8%. He also has a history of a deep vein thrombosis in his left leg a year ago  which was treated with anticoagulation therapy.   Family History:   His mother died at the age of 70 from a stroke  and his father died from a myocardial infarction at 65. His older brother  aged 70  has a history of coronary artery disease.  Physical Examination:   On initial examination  Mr. Hughes was observed to be in acute respiratory distress. He was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/minute and an oxygen saturation on room air of 89%. His blood pressure was 130/80mmHg  and his pulse rate was 110 bpm. On auscultation  there were decreased breath sounds on the right lower side of the chest.  Investigations:   A preliminary electrocardiogram showed a sinus tachycardia with an incomplete right bundle branch block. A subsequent chest CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment And Response:   Mr. Hughes was promptly started on supplemental oxygen and anticoagulation therapy. After 72 hours  patient's symptoms improved and his oxygen saturation levels returned to normal. A repeat imaging study showed resolution of the embolism.  Summary:   Mr. Hughes' past medical history and presenting symptoms fit the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. The early detection and prompt start of treatment massively contributed to his recovery. His history of DVT and smoking history should alert medical practitioners to the slightly increased risk for thromboembolic events. Hence  a strict follow-up for the management of risk factors is advised.   Outcome:   James is planned for discharge with long-term oral anticoagulation and follow-up appointments with Hematology to manage his risk factors. Education about modifiable risk factors  medication compliance  and when to seek medical help were reinforced with the patient.

Lung auscultation revealed normal breath sounds with no added sounds. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable apart from tachycardia.  Lab Results: His initial arterial blood gases (ABGs) showed hypoxemia and mild respiratory alkalosis. His complete blood count  renal and liver parameter did not reveal abnormal findings. Prothrombin time (PT)  activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)  and D-Dimer levels were checked. The D-Dimer was raised which increased the suspicion of a pulmonary embolism.   Imaging: A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the presence of multiple small emboli to both lungs  more on the right side than the left.  Final Diagnosis: The most likely cause for Mr. Jones' clinical condition was diagnosed as an Acute Pulmonary Embolism.  Treatment Plan:  He was promptly started on therapeutic-dose intravenous heparin infusion as a bridge to long-term oral Anticoagulant therapy. Risk factor modification such as smoking cessation  regular exercise  and proper diet was advised  to manage his hypertension and diabetes better and to prevent future complications. His condition improved gradually over the next few days  and plans for discharge with oral anticoagulants were made.   Considering the family history  the patient was also advised to attend cardiovascular and neurology clinics for regular check-ups for early detection of dementia and heart disease. He was also educated about the symptoms of deep vein thrombosis and advised to seek medical attention if he notices any such changes.

Present Illness: Mrs. Jacobs complained about sudden chest pain  shortness of breath  and profuse sweating which she categorized as severe. She also noticed an increase in her heart rate. These symptoms started approximately 3 hours prior to her ER visit.  Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history revealed that she had been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which she had been taking medication as prescribed. She was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) two years ago. She had a well-controlled medical history with no surgeries or hospitalizations.  Family History: She has a positive family history of cardiovascular diseases as her father and one of her brothers had myocardial infarctions in their 50s. Her mother is alive with hypertension and diabetes.  Personal and Social History: Mrs. Jacobs is a retired school teacher who lives alone  is widowed  and has two children. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. She reports leading a relatively sedentary lifestyle and has recently undertaken a long car trip.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  tachypnea  tachycardia  and reduced oxygen saturation level at 92% were noted. Her blood pressure was slightly elevated at 140/90 mmHg.  Investigation Results: D-dimer test showed a massively elevated level. CT pulmonary angiography confirmed the presence of a significant pulmonary embolism burden.   Diagnosis: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Plan: The patient was admitted to a monitored bed in the intensive care unit for further treatment. As she was at high risk because of the significant PE burden  she was started on therapeutic anticoagulation (heparin)  which will later be switched to novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC). Regular monitoring of her vital signs  oxygen saturation  and response to treatment was mandated. A follow-up appointment was scheduled post-discharge with a pulmonologist and a cardiologist.  In view of her history of DVT  a sedentary lifestyle  and recent long car trip  it is recommended for Mrs. Jacobs to make lifestyle modifications. These include incorporating regular physical activity in her daily routine and using compression stockings while traveling. The risk-benefit ratio of continuing anticoagulation therapy will also be re-evaluated after three months.

9,9,28,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial28,Patient Case Presentation - Acute Pulmonary Embolism -------------------------------------------------------------  I. Patient Details: --------------------- The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  named Mr. Richard Dawson. He is 170 cm tall  weighs 84 kg  and is a retired teacher.  II. Presenting Complaint: --------------------------- Mr. Dawson has been brought to the ER complaining of sudden  acute chest pain and shortness of breath that started a few hours ago. He also mentioned experiencing dizziness and an episode of fainting.  III. Past Medical History: ---------------------------- On further investigations of his past medical history  it has been found that Mr. Dawson was diagnosed with hypertension 12 years ago and has been on medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily). He also underwent a hip replacement surgery around three weeks back due to a fall accident.  IV. Family History: ---------------------- His father died of a myocardial infarction  and his older brother was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the past.   V. Physical Examination: ---------------------------- He has a blood pressure reading of 165/95 mmHg  heart rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. His physical examination is marked by tachycardia  decreased breath sounds on the right side of the chest  and swelling in his right lower leg.  VI. Investigations & Diagnosis: ----------------------------------- Given that the triad of symptoms and signs - chest pain  shortness of breath  and clinical evidence of DVT  of Mr. Dawson pointed towards PE  hence a CT pulmonary angiogram was performed which confirmed a large clot in the right pulmonary artery. The D-Dimer test was also performed which further validated the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. EKG showed signs of right heart strain.  VII: Treatment: ----------------- Mr. Dawson was immediately started on unfractionated heparin for anticoagulation. After the clinical stabilization  he was then transitioned to oral anticoagulants  which he will need to continue for several months.

Summary:  In view of the clinical presentation  past medical history suggestive of multiple risk factors (history of hypertension  diabetes  smoking)  family history (brother with DVT)  raised D-Dimer levels  and positive radiological evidence of clot in the lung  a diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism was made. The patient was successfully managed with oxygen therapy and anticoagulation therapy in the hospital. "
9,9,30,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial30,Presentation:  The patient  Mr. Johnson  is a 72-year-old African American male presenting with sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath at rest which started two days ago. His medical history reveals a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension. He has been on a combination of antihypertensive drugs including ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers for his hypertension. He also has a 40-year pack history of cigarette smoking.   Regarding familial history  Mr. Johnson has two late brothers  one died from a myocardial infarction and the other from stoke  both at relatively young ages (60s). He lives with his wife and their two adult children  in a 2-story house and refers to be mostly sedentary  avoiding any strenuous activities as a result of feeling short-of-breath.   Recently  he was on a long international flight back to the states (about 12 hours of flight time) from visiting relatives. He noticed that he became increasingly short of breath for about two days  which didn't improve with rest. Today  upon arrival to the emergency department (ED)  he appears visibly distressed  diaphoretic  and tachypneic. His vitals in the ED are as follows  Blood pressure: 114/78 mmHg  Heart rate: 112 bpm  RR: 28 breaths per minute  Oxygen saturation: 89%  Temperature: 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit.  He received oxygen and is currently on 2L per nasal cannula. He is still tachypneic and short of breath. His right lower leg is slightly swollen and darker in color compared to his left leg. Due to the suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism  a computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was performed revealing a large clot burden in the right main pulmonary artery. D-dimer levels were also elevated.  In light of his history  clinical picture  and diagnostic imaging  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism. He was subsequently started on anticoagulation therapy. His family has been informed  and discussions about the importance of medication adherence  lifestyle modifications  and potential measures to prevent future deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) are ongoing. 
9,9,31,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial31,Case Presentation  Patient Profile: Mr. X is a 60-year-old African-American male  who works as an accountant. He's married with two children  weighs approximately 90 kg  and stands at 6 feet tall.  Presenting Complaint: He presents to the emergency department of our hospital with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath followed by sharp  stabbing chest pains worsened by deep breathing. The patient also reports feeling lightheaded and is experiencing substantial sweating.  Past Medical History: The patient is known to have Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes  both of which he manages with medication (metformin for diabetes and amlodipine for high blood pressure). He also had an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a knee replacement surgery approximately two years ago  for which he took anticoagulants for six months.  Family History: Both his parents had hypertension and his father died of a myocardial infarction in his late 70s. His older sister also has type 2 diabetes. There is no known history of hereditary clotting disorders in his family.  Social History: The patient leads a sedentary lifestyle and works predominantly seated. He indicates occasional alcohol intake but denies any smoking habits or use of illicit drugs. His diet primarily consists of processed foods and he admits to struggling with weight management.  Investigations: Preliminary examination reveals tachycardia with a rate of 100 bpm and tachypnea with 22 breaths/min. His blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg. ECG shows sinus tachycardia. A CT pulmonary angiogram is ordered and confirms the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism.   Laboratory Findings: A D-dimer test was also found to be positive. His complete blood count  kidney  and liver function tests are within normal limits. His HbA1C is 7.2  indicating suboptimal glucose control.   Summary: Mr. X's symptoms  prior history of DVT  and the recent CT scan's findings solidly confirm an acute pulmonary embolism. His history of hypertension  diabetes  and a sedentary lifestyle places him at a higher risk for thromboembolic events. Given his prior medication history  compliance  and current situation  an appropriate anticoagulation treatment plan is being considered. In addition  lifestyle modifications and better diabetes management will be crucial components in his recovery and long-term health strategy.
9,9,32,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial32,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 58-year-old African American male  named John  with a history of obesity and chronic sedentary lifestyle. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His past medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are well-controlled with medication (Atenolol and Atorvastatin  respectively). He lives with his wife and has three adult children. He is a retired engineer.  Family History:  John's father passed away at a young age (in his late 50s) due to myocardial infarction. His mother is living and has Type II diabetes. One of his siblings was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism at 50 years old. John has never had any genetic or blood clotting disorder testing.  Presenting Symptoms:  John presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath coupled with chest pain which started earlier in the morning while he was reading the newspaper. He complained that his symptoms worsened when lying down and he found relief when he sat upright. John also noted feeling anxious due to breathing difficulty. He denied any cough  leg swelling  or recent long travel.  Examination:  On examination  he was in obvious distress. His vitals revealed tachycardia (heart rate elevated at 110 beats/minute) and mild hypotension. Oxygen saturation was low (85%). He was afebrile. Exam also noted his body mass index (BMI) was at the level of obesity. Lungs auscultation showed poor air entry bilaterally. The rest of the exam was within normal limits  including a normal neurological exam.  Diagnosis:  His D-dimer levels were extremely high  raising high suspicion of a clot. A subsequent Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) revealed a large clot in the right pulmonary artery confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Management and prognosis:  John was immediately started on anticoagulation therapy with Low Molecular Weight Heparin and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was arranged. Arrangement was also made for a consultants from cardiology  hematology and pulmonology teams to further manage the patient's condition.  This case demonstrates the importance of considering Pulmonary Embolism (PE) in patients presenting with sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain  especially in patients with risk factors like obesity  hypertension  and a family history of PE. This case also underscores the need for quick evaluation and immediate treatment in these types of patients to lower the mortality rate.
9,9,33,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial33,Case Presentation  Patient Information: Mr. J. Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department of our hospital over the weekend. His chief complaints were sudden onset shortness of breath and sharp  stabbing chest pain. The symptoms began abruptly two hours prior to hospital admission. His daughter reported he looked pale  somewhat sweaty  and appeared quite anxious.   Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has had chronic hypertension for the last 15 years  for which he takes Lisinopril. He also has a history of unprovoked deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of his right lower leg  diagnosed three years ago for which he received anticoagulant therapy but had discontinued this one year ago. Mr. Doe has no history of coronary artery disease  diabetes  or respiratory illness.  Family History: His family history revealed that his father died from an acute myocardial infarction at 67 years old  and his mother passed away from breast cancer at the age of 76. His younger brother was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism at the age of 51 but is alive and in good health after treatment.   Social History: Mr. Doe is a retired accountant who smokes about half a packet of cigarettes per day for the last 30 years. He consumes the occasional social drink of alcohol but denies illicit drug use. He has been generally active but recognizes that he has been less mobile during recent lockdown measures due to the pandemic.  Physical Examination: On assessment  he was conscious  but had marked respiratory distress. His blood pressure was 105/75 mmHg  his pulse was 112 bpm  the respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  and he had an oxygen saturation of 92% while breathing room air.  Clinical Course: His blood tests showed raised D-dimer levels  a complete blood count and chemistry panel came out normal. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any abnormalities. Owing to the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism  a CT pulmonary angiography was done  which confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral pulmonary embolism.  Key Issues/Plan: The plan includes the initiation of anticoagulant therapy and monitoring his oxygen saturation and hemodynamic stability closely. As he also has a history of DVT and a recurrence of venous thromboembolism  a consultation with a hematologist will be scheduled to discuss the possibility of a lifelong anticoagulant treatment. His smoking habits should be addressed and should be given smoking cessation advice  given the underlying cardiac risks due to hypertension.

The pain worsened on deep breathing and did not radiate to any other part of the body.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which have been well-controlled with medication. He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 2 years ago. He takes ramipril  metformin  and atorvastatin.  Family History:  His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  both his father and paternal uncle having suffered myocardial infarctions in their sixth decade.  Social History:  He is an occasional smoker and consumes alcohol socially. His job as an investment banker is largely sedentary with long working hours and frequent air travel.   Examination and Investigation:  On examination  he was found to be in respiratory distress with tachypnea  tachycardia  and decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2 90% on room air). His blood pressure was stable. Blood tests showed elevated D-dimer levels. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia but no signs of myocardial infarction. A Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) showing a large embolus lodged in the right main pulmonary artery.  Diagnosis and Treatment:  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism likely secondary to his history of DVT and recent long-haul flight (risk factors for VTE - venous thromboembolism). He was started on therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and later bridged to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). His case was discussed with the Hematology team and it was agreed to continue lifelong anticoagulation considering his risk factors and previous episodes. He was stabilized  educated about the importance of medication compliance  and was discharged with outpatient follow-ups.    Throughout his hospital stay  he was closely monitored for complications including deterioration in respiratory status or signs of bleeding  a possible side effect of anticoagulation therapy.  Outcome and Plan:  Mr. Smith recovered well with a notable improvement in his symptoms. He was advised to mitigate other modifiable risk factors  such as trying to quit smoking  reducing alcohol intake  maintaining a balanced diet  and incorporating regular physical activity into his routine. He will be reviewed routinely in the outpatient clinic  focusing on adherence to medication and lifestyle modification advice. He was also suggested to wear compression stockings during prolonged periods of immobility such as long flights to reduce the risk of DVT.

9,9,42,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial42,Patient Presentation  Patient Details:  The patient is a 55-year-old African American male  who lives and works in New York as a bank manager. He smokes approximately half a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 30 years and consumes alcohol moderately. He is overweight with a BMI of 30 and is consistently engaged in a sedentary lifestyle.  Medical History:  The patient has a medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and chronic type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was diagnosed with both these conditions 10 years ago. His medication includes Metformin 1000mg twice daily  Losartan 50mg once a day  and daily Aspirin 81mg. He is inconsistent with his medications and follow-ups due to his busy work life.   Family History: His father died at 60 from a myocardial infarction and his maternal aunt from a stroke at the age of 50. He has two elder brothers who are both living and have histories of deep vein thrombosis. No family history of malignancy is noted.  Presenting Complaints: The patient arrived at the emergency department presenting with a sudden onset of shortness of breath  pleuritic chest pain  and mild hemoptysis. He also reported a progressively worsening left leg pain and swelling over the past week  which he initially overlooked  attributing it to prolonged sitting at work.  Examination & Investigation: On examination  his heart rate was 110 beats per minute  blood pressure was 155/95mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  oxygen saturations 90% on room air. An ECG showed signs of right heart strain. A Doppler Ultrasound of his left leg revealed a thrombus in the deep veins of the calf  and a subsequent CT Chest angiography confirmed a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment: He was immediately commenced on low molecular weight heparins and plans for long-term anticoagulation were discussed. An IVC filter was also considered due to his significant risk of recurrent DVT and PE. He was counseled on the importance of regular follow-ups  medication adherence  and lifestyle modifications  including smoking cessation  weight reduction  and adding exercise to his daily routine.  Future Consideration: Given his lifestyle  strong family history and co-morbidities  the patient is at significantly high risk for further cardiovascular events. It is advised that he needs stringent cardiovascular risk factor modification  close follow-up care  and patient education regarding the signs of DVT and pulmonary embolism.

9,9,43,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial43,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Dwight Becker  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented himself to the emergency department with symptoms of acute shortness of breath  chest discomfort  and cough with blood-streaked sputum. He is a retired corporate officer  widowed  and takes care of his small farm partly for sustenance and partly as a physical activity hobby.   Past Medical History: Mr. Becker has a history of hypertension and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes five years ago  which is currently managed with metformin. He also has moderately managed osteoarthritis. He is a former smoker  with a smoking history of 30 pack-years  having quit seven years ago. He also enjoys a moderate alcohol intake weekly. In the past ten years  he has maintained exercise and dietary discipline that has helped manage his blood pressure and blood sugar.  Family History: The patient's father had coronary artery disease and passed away in his 70s due to a myocardial infarction. His mother had osteoarthritis  but lived until the ripe age of 83. His older sister (68 years old) is alive and has a history of rheumatic heart disease.  Current Presentation: Mr. Becker rated his chest pain as 6/10 on the pain scale  describing it as a sudden sharp pain under the rib cage while breathing. He reported a two-day history of progressive dyspnea and calf pain  as well as tachycardia and a fainting episode. The patient's vitals at presentation were as follows: BP - 148/92 mmHg  HR - 115 bpm  RR - 22 breaths/min  T - 98.6°F  SpO2 - 92% on room air. His BMI calculates to be 29.9 (Height: 5 feet 8 inches  Weight: 195 pounds).  Diagnostic Evaluation and Outcome: Based on the symptoms and the elevated D-dimer level  a CT angiogram was ordered  which confirmed bi-lateral pulmonary emboli. Lower extremity Doppler studies verified a DVT in his right calf. He was admitted to the hospital and promptly started on anticoagulation (heparin drip). Over the next three days  his symptoms improved significantly. He was transitioned to oral warfarin for long-term therapy.  Further management includes risk factor modification and a thrombophilia workup to determine possible genetic or acquired predisposition. He has been advised regular follow-ups and to continue the exercise and diet for his comorbidities.  Therefore  the in-depth examination  appropriate lab studies  understanding patient history  swift diagnosis  and prompt management paved the way for a quick recovery from this precarious condition.   Over the next visits  the clinical focus would be on compliance with the medications for the comorbid conditions and the newly diagnosed PE  necessary lifestyle modifications  and to ensure early detection and intervention for possible exacerbations or complications.
9,9,44,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial44,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith  a 65-year-old male  presented with sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain that intensified with breathing. He has no known allergies but has a past medical history significant for hypertension  diabetes  and smoking. Mr. Smith is a retired lawyer  a lifetime smoker with a 30 pack year history  a weekend alcoholic  and has a sedentary lifestyle. He lives with his wife and does not have any kids. He denies any illicit drug use. He takes Metformin and Lisinopril for his diabetes and hypertension  respectively and is compliant with his medications.  Family History:   His father had an ischemic stroke at the age of 70 and his mother has hypertension and osteoporosis. His brother was recently diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Current Presentation:   The patient reported experiencing a sudden onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain for the last 6 hours. There have been no previous episodes of this nature. He denies cough  fever  night sweats  weight loss  or hemoptysis. He also denies recent prolonged immobility  surgery  or trauma.   Physical Exam:   Physical examination demonstrated a moderately distressed man due to dyspnea. His vitals included blood pressure of 145/95 mm Hg  heart rate of 105 bpm  respiratory rate of 22 per minute  temperature of 98.7°F  and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. His BMI was calculated to be 28. His cardiovascular exam was notable for tachycardia but no murmurs  rubs  or gallop. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally  but he had decreased breath sounds on the right side. Lower extremity examination did not reveal any signs of DVT.   Investigations and Diagnosis:  Given the acute onset of symptoms and family history of DVT  a hypercoagulability work-up was ordered  including D-dimer which came back elevated. CT Pulmonary Angiogram was performed that confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  with evidence of a large clot burden within the right pulmonary artery.   Management:  Mr. Smith was promptly started on Oxygen therapy and anticoagulant medication  low molecular weight heparin  was initiated. In view of his large clot burden and elevated troponin  a discussion regarding the appropriateness of thrombolytic therapy was held.  Conclusion:  This case of Mr. Smith is a clear example of how a sedentary lifestyle  along with other practices  such as smoking and alcohol  can contribute to life-threatening conditions like acute PE. Public health efforts should aim at educating people on recognizing signs of conditions like PE and seeking prompt help.  Note: Patient and family consent taken for case discussion.

9,9,51,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial51,Patient Overview:  Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented with chief complaints of sudden shortness of breath and sharp chest pain  particularly upon deep inhalation. The patient reports that the symptoms began abruptly a few hours prior to his hospital visit.   History:  Mr. Doe has a history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension  both managed with metformin and lisinopril  respectively. He has no documented allergies. His station involved a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity. Mr. Doe had a recent history of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT)  four weeks ago after a long overseas flight; it was treated with rivaroxaban. He does not smoke cigarettes or consume alcohol.   Family History:  The patient's family history is notable for myocardial infarction with his father passing away at 72 years of age. His mother had type II diabetes and died of stroke at the age of 78. The patient has one sibling who is alive and healthy.  Physical Examination:  The patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. He was tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was low at 92% on room air. Blood pressure was 138/86 mmHg.   Investigations:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with S1Q3T3 pattern. His D-dimer was significantly elevated. Complete blood count and metabolic panel were within normal limits except for an elevated serum glucose level. Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or pneumothorax. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the chest revealed acute embolus in the right and left pulmonary arteries  indicating the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE).   Management and Conclusion:  The severity of the PE was considered massive due to hemodynamic instability. Therefore  Mr. Doe was admitted to the intensive care unit and was initiated on thrombolytic therapy with alteplase  followed by systemic anticoagulation. His symptoms gradually improved  and he was later switched to warfarin.  In conclusion  Mr. Doe’s previous episode of deep venous thrombosis (DVT)  sedentary lifestyle  and his recent long flight probably predisposed him to this acute episode of pulmonary embolism. Assertive management and follow-up will be necessary to prevent future thromboembolic events. He should also be educated about the importance of mobility  especially during long-haul flights  and the need for adherence to prescribed anticoagulant therapy.

Mr. Thomson lives in Los Angeles  California with his wife of 40 years. He describes himself as a light social drinker and a non-smoker. His Body Mass Index (BMI) is 27  indicating that he is slightly overweight.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thomson has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 5 years ago  which was treated with anticoagulant therapy. He also has hypertension controlled with medications and a history of a minor myocardial infarction 7 years ago. No known drug allergies are reported.  Demographics: Mr. Thomson is physically active  engaging in golf and regular walking. He follows a moderately healthy diet with occasional indulgence in high cholesterol foods. His alcohol intake is moderate  and his caffeine intake is high due to his habit of drinking 2-3 cups of coffee a day.  Family History: His family history is significant with his father dying of a massive heart attack at age 62  and his mother  currently 92 years of age  has persistent atrial fibrillation. His older brother  age 72  is in good health with no significant medical conditions.  Recent Events: Mr. Thomson recently returned from a trip from Australia  a flight lasting approximately 15 hours. His symptoms began during the flight but were mild and he dismissed them as fatigue.   Presentation: On presentation  Mr. Thomson described a sharp and stabbing retrosternal chest discomfort radiating to the back  accompanied by dyspnea. Increased work of breathing with decreased breath sounds over the right lung was observed. Pulse oximetry showed an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air.  Investigations & Diagnosis: A D-dimer test was ordered due to his history of DVT and was found to be elevated  necessitating further workup. His EKG showed tachycardia but no signs of an acute heart attack. Subsequent CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) confirmed the presence of an acute pulmonary embolism in the right lung.  Management: The patient was stabilized with supplemental oxygen and started on anticoagulant therapy with heparin and warfarin for long-term management of the condition.   Possible risk factors in this case include his advanced age  prolonged immobilization during the long-haul flight  being slightly overweight  personal history of DVT  and a family history of cardiovascular disease. It will be necessary to keep these in mind when managing this patient's condition and planning for future prevention of recurrent events.   Plans include ongoing anticoagulant therapy  risk factor modification such as assistance with weight loss  further investigation for possible malignancy as this can also contribute to a hypercoagulable state  and possible placement of an inferior vena cava filter to prevent future embolisms.  The patient and his family were educated about the disease  its complications  and the importance of adherence to medication  lifestyle modification  and regular follow-ups.

Current Treatment and Medications:  Mr. S has been on warfarin and furosemide for his previous DVT. The medication has now been escalated to include Heparin  to rapidly thin his blood.  Impression: Given the sudden onset of symptoms  the patient’s medical history  physical examination  and imaging studies  Mr. S has been diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism  likely a complication of his previous DVT.  Discussion: The major risk factors for Mr. S are the history of DVT  his age  and his COPD. It is now crucial to keep him under close monitoring and adjust the anticoagulant treatment as necessary. It is also advisable to assess if there are any other possible risk factors for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. A multi-disciplinary approach will be necessary for managing this patient's illness.  Plan: The immediate plan is to continue anticoagulant therapy while monitoring the patient closely in the ICU. Given the emerging evidence around the sequelae of acute pulmonary embolism  Mr. S is a candidate for early mobilization  physiotherapy  and rehabilitation. Further  he should be educated about the signs of worsening symptoms and when to seek medical help. His treatment will involve regular follow-up visits and monitoring of his medication regimen.

Presenting Complaint: The patient stepped into the Emergency Department complaint about sudden chest pain and shortness of breath that started 4 hours prior to his visit. Associated symptoms included cough  dizziness  and a general feeling of unwellness.  Medical History: The patient has a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  which is well-controlled via oral hypoglycemics  hypertension treated with ACE inhibitors  and occasional episodes of deep vein thrombosis treated with anticoagulants. He also reports occasional bouts of anxiety  but he has not sought any psychiatric treatment for this. No known allergies.  Surgical History: Underwent a cholecystectomy twenty years ago due to gall bladder stone and an appendectomy at the age of 12.  Family History: His father died of a stroke at the age of 74  and his mother is alive at 90 years old dealing with Alzheimer's disease. His eldest sister died at 62 due to breast cancer.  Social History: The patient lives with his wife and has 2 adult children. He is a retired army officer with no travel history in recent times due to the covid-19 pandemic. Reports having a nutritious diet and walking for extensive periods are a daily routine for him.   Examination Findings: On examination  the patient had a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure was 150/90 mm Hg  respiratory rate of 24 per minute  and oxygen saturation was 90% on room air. The chest examination revealed tachypnea and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field. No pitting edema or tenderness was noted in the legs. Rest of physical examination was normal.  Outcome (Diagnosis and Treatment Plan): The CT pulmonary angiography demonstrated multiple filling defects in the pulmonary arteries of both lungs suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. ECG showed signs of right heart strain. The patient was admitted to the ICU and administered heparin infusion initially for immediate anticoagulation. For long-term anticoagulation  considering his past history of DVT  warfarin was selected.   The patient’s family was explained about the disease condition and the need for long-term anticoagulation  regular PT/INR monitoring  the possibility of bleeding risk  and diet modification due to warfarin therapy. The multidisciplinary team would manage associated hypertension and diabetes. His progress will be closely monitored.  This case underscores the importance of considering pulmonary embolism diagnosis in individuals presenting with unexplained shortness of breath  particularly in individuals with known coagulation abnormalities  or who are at increased risk of clotting such as with a history of DVT  hypertension  and diabetes  as seen in this patient's case. 
9,9,58,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial58,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe  a 58-year-old Caucasian male  presented with sudden-onset dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain and small hemoptysis.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia and alcoholism. The patient is a former smoker with a 20-year history  but he claims to have quit 10 years ago. He had a myocardial infarction 8 years ago followed with stent placement. His medications include aspirin  lisinopril  metoprolol  and pravastatin. He reports compliance with these medications.  Demographics:  Mr. Doe is a retired military officer  who is currently working part-time consulting for a security firm. He is married and lives with his wife in the suburbs. He has two adult children living out of state. He is a moderate alcohol consumer  but denies illicit drug use.  Family History:  Mr. Doe's father passed away from a heart attack at age 75 and his mother passed away from a stroke at age 70. His sister  aged 65  is living with type 2 diabetes and his brother  63  was recently diagnosed with lung cancer.  Clinical Story:  Mr. Doe felt well until two days ago when he suffered from sudden onset of chest pain and shortage of breath during his morning walk. The chest pain was described as sharp  worsened on deep inspiration and did not radiate. He also complained of cough with a small amount of blood tinged sputum. Mr. Doe initially neglected the signs assuming it as recurrence of his gastric reflux  but when he started experiencing mild dizziness and persistent dyspnea  he consulted the hospital. His vital signs at presentation were within the normal range except mild tachypnea and elevated blood pressure.  Diagnostic tests clicked towards acute pulmonary embolism. He received a D-dimer test which came back elevated. Follow up CT pulmonary angiogram was performed revealing multiple pulmonary emboli in both lung fields. Echocardiogram was also ordered showing a normal left ventricular function with no signs of right ventricular strain.  Key Points:  The patient's sudden onset of chest pain  complaints of breathlessness  hemoptysis led to a suspicion of pulmonary embolism. The patient is at an increased risk due his past medical history of myocardial infarction  hypertension and his family history. The diagnosis was further substantiated with elevated D-dimer test and confirmed by Pulmonary CT angiogram.  Initial Management:  Mr. Doe was initially given oxygen to maintain SpO2 above 94%. Simultaneously  he was started on a Heparin drip for immediate anticoagulation while being evaluated for potential thrombectomy based on the large clot burden. The patient will need to be transitioned to long-term anticoagulation pending resolution and stability of the acute embolic event. Further  the patient will also require follow-up outpatient care with cardiology and pulmonology specialists.
9,9,59,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial59,Patient Overview:   A 50-year-old African American male presents to the Emergency Department (ED) with severe shortness of breath that has gradually worsened over the past three days. He is a non-smoker with a history of obesity (BMI 31)  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which are all managed with medication (ACE inhibitors and Metformin  respectively). The patient also reported intermittent chest pain and lightheadedness.   Medical History:  The patient has been hospitalized twice over the past 5 years for similar symptoms  with the most recent being 2 years back. Previous evaluations for ischemic heart disease had been negative. His father died of a stroke in his 70s  and his mother has type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.   Clinical Assessment & Investigations:  The patient is anxious  diaphoretic  and his oxygen saturation is 89% on room air. Physical examination reveals tachycardia (heart rate - 110 bpm)  tachypnea (respiration rate - 24 breaths per minute)  and blood pressure of 160/100 mm Hg. Upon auscultation  breath sounds are diminished in the lower lung fields.   A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) shows S1Q3T3 pattern suggestive of right heart strain and sinus tachycardia. There are no signs of previous myocardial infarction. His D-dimer level is significantly elevated. A CT pulmonary angiography was ordered  confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism with a saddle embolus in the bifurcation of the major pulmonary arteries.  Management:   Started on a therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Cardiothoracic surgery is consulted for possibly emergent thrombectomy due to hemodynamic instability. The patient is also started on supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 saturation above 92%.   Follow-up:  He is to be transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management and close probation. A discussion on anticoagulation and the prevention of future thromboembolic events will be held once the patient is stable. The importance of optimal control of his other comorbid conditions (hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and obesity) will be reiterated during follow-up after his recovery from the acute event.   This case presents a classic example of acute pulmonary embolism  highlighting the importance of urgent investigation and treatment in such cases to prevent fatal outcomes.

9,9,65,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial65,Patient Information:  Patient Mr. John Doe is a 57-year-old Caucasian male  married  an active smoker with a 30 pack-year history. He is a secondary school teacher by profession.  Presenting Symptoms: John presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  especially upon coughing and breathing deeply  and fainting spell.  Medical History: Upon examination  significant history in John includes Grade 2 Hypertension for the past ten years  moderate obesity (BMI 31.5)  and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus managed on medication for the past five years. Steroid medication for rheumatoid arthritis was added to the regimen 3 months prior.  Surgical History: He also has a surgical history of a bilateral knee replacement procedure three weeks prior.  Family History: John's father died of myocardial infarction at age 60  and his mother is living with COPD. His only sibling  a brother  is asymptomatic but has recently been diagnosed with thrombophilia.  Diagnosis: Based on John's symptoms  namely the shortness of breath  chest pain  and fainting  he was suspected to have an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). A computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was conducted  which confirmed the diagnosis by revealing a large clot in the right pulmonary artery.  Treatment Plan: John has been acutely managed with intravenous Heparin for anticoagulation. Considering the high risk for future clotting given John's history of pre-existing conditions  prolonged anticoagulation moving to Warfarin as an oral medication and addressing weight loss and smoking cessation were advised.  Clinical Course & Outcomes: The patient showed progressive improvements over the next few days  following which he was safely discharged with a follow-up appointment in the outpatient clinic in one week.  Discussion: In this case  Mr. Doe presented with classic symptoms of pulmonary embolism  which likely arose due to his recent surgical procedure  immobility  smoking habits  and chronic medical conditions which increase his risk for clotting. His family’s medical history also reveals a genetic disposition to clotting disorders. Identification of these risks and directed interventions to control modifiable factors signify a crucial aspect in managing such patients.   This case serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilant surveillance for potential PE  especially among patients who have undergone recent surgery or who are immobilized and are smokers or are overweight  and the role of anticoagulant therapy in the management of PE. It emphasizes the importance of lifestyle factors in the development and progression of such significant health problems.

This validated the diagnosis of an Acute Pulmonary Embolism.  Management:   Mr. John is subsequently started on intravenous heparin and admitted to the ICU for further management. He was further evaluated for a longer-term anticoagulation plan by the hospital’s Hematology team.  In this case  the patient’s age  sedentary lifestyle  long travel history  and previous DVT put him at high risk of developing a PE. His current clinical presentation and confirmatory imaging led to the final diagnosis of an acute pulmonary embolism.
9,9,71,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial71,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. X  is a 62-year-old Caucasian male residing in Boston. He presented to the emergency department with new onset of acute chest pain and shortness of breath.  Past Medical History:  Mr. X has a history of hypertension controlled with medication (Losartan 50mg daily) and type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with Metformin. He also has a 20 pack-year history of smoking. There is no known history of surgeries or prior hospitalizations. In general  he has an irregular schedule of moderate physical activity  walking mostly.   Family History:  The patient's mother died of a heart attack at age 67  and his father passed away at 72 from lung cancer. His older sister is living with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. There is no known history of any clotting disorders in the family.  Social History:  Mr. X is a retired school principal. He is a regular smoker  consuming approximately a pack of cigarettes per day and has done so for more than 40 years. He denies any use of illicit drugs or alcohol abuse.  Present Illness History:  Mr. X reported progressive chest discomfort that had begun two days ago  accompanied by mild weakness  diaphoresis  palpitations  and breathlessness. There is no associated cough  fever  or hemoptysis. He also noted a recent episode of left lower limb swelling and discomfort  which he attributed to an ankle sprain 2 weeks ago.  Physical Exam:  Upon examination  Mr. X was in visible distress  pale  sweating  and experiencing tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Vital signs: Blood pressure was 145/90 mmHg  heart rate 110 beats per minute  SpO2 92% on room air. Auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds in the left lung base and a tachycardic but regular heart rhythm. His left lower limb was mildly swollen and warm to the touch.  Investigations:  Given the combination of chest pain  increased shortness of breath  and history of recent leg swelling  acute pulmonary embolism was suspected. A D-dimer test was ordered  which came back significantly elevated. CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed the diagnosis with the presence of a large embolus located in his left lower lobe pulmonary artery. EKG showed sinus tachycardia and incomplete RBBB but no clear signs of right heart strain.  Management:  Mr. X was admitted to the ICU  started on oxygen therapy  and anticoagulation with intravenous heparin  bridged to warfarin later. The lower extremity duplex ultrasound showed evidence of a deep vein thrombosis in the left popliteal vein. Upon discharge  patient education was emphasized  particularly regarding medication compliance  smoking cessation  increased physical activity  and regular follow-up.  Prognosis:  The patient's prognosis largely depends on his ability to manage risk factors such as smoking and sedentary lifestyle  and adherence to anticoagulation therapy. Close medical follow-up will be required.
9,9,72,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial72,Patient Profile: Name: Robert Schmidt  Age: 65-year-old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired accountant  Presenting Complaint: Robert presented to the emergency department with an ongoing onset of sudden chest pain which exacerbated during deep breaths. Accompanying symptoms include light-headedness  dyspnea  and mild hemoptysis (blood-tinged sputum).  Medical History: History of hypertension controlled with lisinopril 20 mg daily for the past 15 years. Robert also has been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus since age 50  managed by metformin 500 mg two times per day and a controlled diet. Robert quit smoking 5 years ago but had a smoking history of 20 pack-years.  Family History: Robert’s father had passed away at the age of 70 because of ischemic heart disease. His mother is alive and well at age 85 but has a history of COPD presumably due to a long smoking history. He has two siblings  one of which had a stroke at the age of 60.  Social History: Robert lives with his wife in a suburban area. After retirement  he tends to have a sedentary lifestyle and does not regularly engage in physical activity. He denies alcohol or drug use. He stopped smoking five years ago.  Diagnosis: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Clinical Reasoning: Given Robert's presenting symptoms of chest pain  light-headedness  dyspnea  and mild hemoptysis along with risk factors such as older age  history of smoking  hypertension and sedentary lifestyle  a preliminary diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism was made.   Investigations: This was further confirmed with an elevated D-dimer level  arterial blood gases showing hypoxemia  and CT pulmonary angiogram showing presence of clot in the pulmonary arteries.  Treatment Plan: Robert was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. He was initially started on intravenous heparin. After having the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism confirmed by a CT pulmonary angiogram  it was decided to transition to oral anticoagulants such as Rivaroxaban for long term management.   Follow-up/Plan: Robert was informed about his diagnosis and the importance of medication adherence. A follow-up appointment was booked for two weeks post-discharge to monitor the therapeutic effect of the anticoagulant and review the need for further imaging or possible referral for thrombolysis or surgery.  Patient Education: Educated on thrombus prevention including increased mobility  hydration  and wearing compression stockings during long periods of immobility. Counseled on tobacco abstinence and better management of his diabetes and hypertension through healthy diet and regular exercise. Informed to watch for signs of excessive bleeding.
9,9,73,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial73,Case Presentation: Patient Overview: Ms. Jane Brown  a 64-year-old woman  has been diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism. She lives in a suburban area in Austin  Texas  with her retired husband. She had been a high school teacher prior to her retirement. She is a non-smoker and drinks occasionally. Her height is 5’5'' and she weighs roughly 165 lbs. Her BMI falls within the 'Overweight' category  but she is otherwise physically active with frequent gardening and light exercises.  Past Medical History: Ms. Brown has a medical history of recurrent Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed 8 years before the current presentation. She was on warfarin therapy for the past 6 years under close monitoring  which was discontinued a year ago due to the recurrent episodes of gum bleeding and bruising. She also has hypertension which is currently being managed by daily antihypertensive medication. She underwent a hysterectomy at the age of 45 due to uterine fibroids; the procedure was uneventful  followed by an uncomplicated recovery.  Family History: Her father passed away from acute myocardial infarction at the age of 65  and her maternal uncle had a stroke at the age of 59. Her two older siblings are reported to have hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Her mother is 88 years old and suffers from dementia. There is no known family history of malignant cancer or genetic disorders.  Presenting Symptoms: Ms. Brown was brought to the ER by her husband due to a sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain which was progressively worsening. She also reported a mild cough and lightheadedness. The chest pain was sharp  localized in the center of her chest  and was exacerbated on taking a deep breath.  Testing and Diagnosis: Initial examination recorded a blood pressure of 158/90 mmHg  pulse 110 beats/min  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Blood tests showed elevated D-Dimer and slight thrombocytopenia. Chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the acute pulmonary embolism. The diagnosis was further validated using the Wells score  as the clinical probability of PE was high in her case. The Wells score components included clinical signs and symptoms of DVT  PE being the most likely diagnosis  and a heart rate more than 100 bpm.  Hospital Course and Management: Ms. Brown was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Anticoagulant therapy was re-started (low molecular weight heparin initially followed by warfarin)  consideration for thrombolytic therapy based on ongoing evaluation. Regular monitoring of her vitals  ECG  and coagulation profile was instituted.   Future Implications: Ms. Brown is advised to follow up with a pulmonologist and a hematologist to monitor her recovery  adjust her anticoagulant therapy as necessary  and evaluate her for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in the future. Lifestyle changes are recommended  including a low sodium diet for her hypertension and exercises tailored to her condition. Her case may merit evaluation for underlying malignancies  given unprovoked DVT subceding the pulmonary embolism. 
9,9,74,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial74,Patient Information:   Mr. John Doe is a 55-year-old Caucasian male. He is married with two children and works as a software engineer with long-hitting hours mostly seated. He is a non-smoker and drinks moderately. He has a known family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of a myocardial infarction at 60 years and his elder brother recently got diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease.  History of Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Doe presented to the emergency department with a complaint of sudden onset  sharp  and stabbing right-sided chest discomfort  which became worse with deep inspiration. He was also experiencing shortness of breath and mild palpitations.  Past Medical History:  On evaluation of his records  Mr. Doe was diagnosed with hypertension about 4 years ago  for which he has been prescribed Amlodipine 5mg once daily. He also suffers from obesity  but there are no signs of diabetes at any point in his medical history  nor any allergies reported.   On Examination:  On admission  his blood pressure was 146/94 mmHg  a heart rate of 104 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 90% while on room air. On physical examination  his chest was clear on auscultation.  Investigations:  Blood reports revealed elevated D-dimer. An EKG showed sinus tachycardia and right bundle branch block. Chest radiograph was essentially unremarkable. CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed the presence of an embolus in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery.  Impression/Diagnosis:   Based on the clinical history  investigation results  and radiologic findings  he was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.  Treatment and Plan:  Mr. Doe was admitted to the respiratory unit. Intravenous Heparin was immediately started  and Warfarin was introduced for long-term anticoagulation. The patient was also advised about the need for weight regulation  regular exercise  and hypertension control as part of his long-term management. He was counselled about the importance of medication compliance and regular follow-ups.   The case was discussed with the vascular surgery team  but as there was no hemodynamic instability  thrombolysis or embolectomy was not considered at this stage.       Follow-up:  The patient’s condition improved over the subsequent days. As his symptoms resolved and his vitals were stable  Mr. Doe was discharged but was advised to continue Warfarin. He is scheduled for a follow-up in the outpatient department with complete blood count and coagulation profile tests 2 weeks post-discharge. 
9,9,75,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial75,Patient Information:   Mr. Johnson  a 65-year-old African-American male  presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and severe chest pain that started while he was reading a newspaper at home.  Medical History:  The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was a heavy smoker with a smoking history of 30 pack-years. He has been jaundiced on occasion but never undergone surgical procedures. His medications include a bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids. He also revealed that he has been a bit sedentary in recent weeks due to a foot injury that kept him largely immobile. There was no known history of malignancy or recent weight loss.  Family History:  Mr. Johnson’s father died of myocardial infarction when he was in his 60s. His mother  currently in her late 80s  suffers from hypertension and type 2 diabetes.   Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  Mr. Johnson appeared anxious and diaphoretic. His respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute  blood pressure 140/90 mmHg  and oxygen saturation was 94% while breathing room air. Auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds at the right lung base accompanied by some crackles.  Investigations:  Blood tests revealed elevated levels of D-dimer. Troponin level was normal which indicated no cardiac involvement. Bedside echocardiography showed signs of right heart strain. This clinical suspicion led the team to perform a CT pulmonary angiogram that showed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli  confirming acute pulmonary embolism.   Treatment:  Mr. Johnson was admitted to the intensive care unit and was immediately begun on therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and supplemental oxygen.   Follow-up:   Arrangements were made for follow-up care in the out-patient clinic to monitor Mr. Johnson's INR and check his response to treatment. Also  he was referred to the smoking cessation clinic and physiotherapy to gradually increase his mobility and avoid recurrence of such episodes in the future.   This case highlights the importance of considering pulmonary embolism as a potentially lethal condition  especially in patients with risk factors such as prolonged immobilization  COPD and a significant smoking history.
9,9,76,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial76,Presenting Patient:   A 65-year-old Caucasian male was brought to the emergency department (ED) by his wife on account of sudden shortness of breath which started approximately 2 hours prior to his arrival. The patient reports having a racing heart and feeling dizzy. His wife also reports that he seemed a bit confused at times. He has no known allergies.  Medical History:  The patient has a medical history of Type 2 Diabetes  controlled with Metformin  and Hypertension managed by Lisinopril. He had laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair surgery approximately 4 weeks ago from which he recovered well according to the reports. He is a former smoker  having stopped 5 years ago after a 30 pack-year history. He admits to occasional alcohol intake and denies any use of recreational drugs.  Family History:  The patient’s father had a myocardial infarction at age 65 and his mother had rheumatoid arthritis. He has a younger brother living with Type 2 Diabetes and a sister who had breast cancer.  Physical Examination:  In the ED  he was noted to be anxious  tachycardic with a heart rate of 120/min  blood-pressure was 145/90 mmHg  respiratory rate was 28 /min  SpO2 was 89% on room air which improved to 94% with 2-litre oxygen via nasal cannula. His BMI was 28  indicating overweight status. Other systems  including cardiovascular  gastrointestinal and neurological showed no significant abnormalities.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Given the patient’s symptoms and recent surgery  a diagnosis of acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) was suspected. D-dimer levels were significantly raised. CT pulmonary angiography was performed  which confirmed the diagnosis by showing a filling defect in the right lower lobar pulmonary artery. The patient's Wells score was 4.5 which placed him in the high-probability category.  Management and Outcomes:  The patient was given supplemental oxygen  started on intravenous (IV) heparin and admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Hospital pharmacists recommended switching from IV Heparin to Apixaban for long term anticoagulation.  Plan:  The plan going forward is to maintain the patient on Apixaban for at least 3 months  as per the recommended guidelines. The patient will also need frequent follow-ups with the pulmonology and cardiology departments  and may require adjustment of his hypertensive drugs. The patient and his wife will need counselling on lifestyle modification  importance of medication adherence  and the signs and symptoms of PE recurrence.   Conclusion:  This is a case of a 65-year-old male who developed acute PE post hernia repair surgery. The likely cause is prolonged immobility post-surgery. The patient recovered with early diagnosis and prompt therapeutic intervention.
9,9,77,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial77,Patient Profile: Mr. Charles  a 68-year-old African-American male  retired lawyer  presents to the emergency room complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness. The symptoms began approximately four hours prior to his visit to the hospital.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from five years ago  and chronic atrial fibrillation  for which he is taking warfarin. He is a former smoker  with a 30-pack-year history. He quit smoking ten years ago. Reportedly  he remains largely sedentary. The patient has an allergy to penicillin-based drugs.  Demographics: Mr. Charles lives at home with his wife and receives support from a home care nurse who visits weekly. He does not consume alcohol or illicit drugs  and has a diet high in fats and low in fruits and vegetables.  Family History: Both his parents had a history of cardiovascular disease  his father suffered from a heart attack at the age of 56 and his mother had an ischemic stroke at the age of 60. His elder brother  currently 70 years of age  has a history of DVT as well.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Charles is experiencing tachypnea (respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute)  tachycardia (heart rate: 102 bpm) and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Temperature and blood pressure were normal at 98.6 °F and 130/80 mmHg  respectively.   Investigations & Diagnosis: Based on his history of DVT and the presenting symptoms  a clinical suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was raised. A D-dimer test was performed which came back positive. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was then conducted  which confirmed an acute PE.   Treatment: The patient was started on a heparin drip and his warfarin was held. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.  This case highlights the importance of considering acute PE in patients with previous history of DVT  atrial fibrillation  and sudden onset of symptoms like shortness of breath and chest pain.  The patient's sedentary lifestyle  diet  past smoking history  and family history all potentially contribute to his heightened risk for cardiovascular events such as DVT and PE. Going forward  these factors will need to be addressed in order to reduce the risk of further complications. Education on the importance of medication adherence in reducing his risk for thromboembolic events will be crucial in his management plan.
9,9,78,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial78,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. J. He presented to the emergency department with sudden onset dyspnea  left-sided chest pain  and hemoptysis. He also complained of feeling faint and mildly nauseated. Upon physical examination  he was slightly cyanotic upon arriving at our facility. His vital signs upon admission were as follows: Blood pressure -150/90mmHg  heart rate - 100bpm  respiratory rate - 20 breaths per minute  and body weight - 80kg.   Past Medical History:  Mr. J has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) about 6 years ago. For this reason  he has been on anticoagulant therapy using Warfarin since then. His latest INR was 2.0  taken 2 months ago  and was not regular in the follow-up visits. He also has a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes  which is managed with Metformin tablets  and a 15-year history of hypertension controlled with Losartan. There is no history of any known allergies.  Family History:  Mr. J comes from a family with a history of cardiovascular diseases. His father passed away at the age of 75 due to myocardial infarction  and his elder brother  now 70  was diagnosed with angina pectoris 5 years ago.  Social History:  He is a retired engineer  married  with 2 adult children who are healthy. Mr. J is a former smoker. He quit 6 years ago  but he had a 30-pack-year smoking history. He drinks socially and doesn't use any illicit drugs.  Clinical Findings and Assessment:  Considering his past medical history of DVT and the present symptoms  a preliminary diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is suspected. An urgent CT angiogram confirms the presence of large emboli in the bilateral pulmonary arteries. D-dimer levels were significantly elevated  and an ECG demonstrated right ventricular strain  consistent with a diagnosis of acute PE.  Hospital Course and Management:  Mr. J was admitted to the ICU in stable condition but requiring close monitoring. He was started on systemic thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in addition to the continuation of anticoagulation therapy. His oxygen saturation and respiratory functions improved gradually.  Conclusion:  This case re-emphasizes the vital connections between patient history  particularly a history of DVT  and the potential for acute pulmonary embolism. An ongoing adherence to management and follow-up with health professionals is significant  primarily when patient's lifestyle factors  such as former smoking and family history  increases the risk of PE. Proper anticoagulant management and patient education can reduce this risk and prevent a serious  potentially life-threatening event like PE. Doctors should ensure that patients  once diagnosed with conditions like DVT  receive adequate counseling regarding the importance of medication compliance and regular follow-up.

9,9,81,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial81,Patient Profile: Mr. John Wilson  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  has presented to the emergency room with complaints of sudden onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and light-headedness that have been intensifying over a period of the last few hours. Mr. Wilson works in a high-stress job as an attorney and lives in the city with his wife. He smokes one pack of cigarettes a day for the last 30 years and drinks alcohol socially. He leads a sedentary lifestyle due to his long working hours.  Past Medical History: Mr. Wilson has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia that was diagnosed five years ago. He is on antihypertensive medications and statins for the same. He has had a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activities and a diet high in saturated fats. No history of surgeries  allergies  or previous episodes of similar symptoms is reported.  Family History: There is a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father had his first myocardial infarction at 60 and his younger brother had a stroke at the age of 50. His mother died of complications from diabetes.  Current Presentation: On physical examination  his BP was recorded at 162/98 mm of Hg  heart rate 112 beats per minute  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient appeared anxious  sweaty and at a rate of respiration that was greater than normal. On auscultation  breath sounds appeared to be decreased on the right lower side of the chest.  Didactic Correlation:  Acute pulmonary embolism was suspected based on the clinical symptoms and patient's risk factors  which include his advanced age  smoking history  sedentary lifestyle  and family history of cardiovascular diseases.   Further Assessment and Diagnosis: A D-dimer test was ordered to rule out pulmonary embolism and the results were positive(580 ng/mL; the reference range is 0 to 500 ng/mL). A CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was ordered and confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Management Plan: Mr. Wilson was admitted to the hospital  started on anticoagulant therapy  oxygen therapy was provided and a hydration status was maintained. He was advised to stop smoking and increase his physical activity along with a proper diet.  Prognosis and Patient Education: Regular follow-ups were recommended to ensure the efficacy of therapy and to monitor for any potential side effects of the medication. Education about the signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism and when to seek immediate help was provided to both Mr. Wilson and his wife.  This case demonstrates the importance of taking patient demographics  past medical history  and family history into account when diagnosing acute conditions. The sedentary lifestyle  coupled with other risk factors such as smoking and family history of cardiovascular diseases  pointed towards the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.
9,9,82,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial82,Patient Presentation:  Name: John K. Doe Age: 65 Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Chief Complaint: Episode of acute chest pain and sudden onset of breathlessness post a long-haul 9-hour flight.  Past medical history:   John is an ex-smoker who quit smoking five years ago after a 30-year habit. He has a history of hypertension  well controlled with Amlodipine. Reported occasional episodes of unspecified arrhythmias  not on any medication.  Family history:   Father passed away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 68. Mother is a 90-year-old with Type 2 diabetes. A younger sibling underwent stent placement for coronary artery disease at 57.  Clinical Examination:  On presentation  his blood pressure was 155/90 mmHg. Heart rate was 106 beats per minute. Oxygen saturation was 93%. Physical examination revealed apparent signs of distress  diaphoresis and tachypnea. Auscultation of lungs exhibited normal breath sounds without any wheeze.  Investigations:  Blood tests showed increased D-dimer level. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed S1Q3T3 pattern suggestive of acute right heart strain. A contrast-enhanced chest CT was performed given the high suspicion of pulmonary embolism  which confirmed extensive bilateral pulmonary embolism.  Management:  Following the stakeholder discussion  John was started on therapeutic unfractionated heparin  while maintaining activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) between 60 to 80 seconds. He was also given supplemental oxygen.  Outcome:  Over the next few days  shortness of breath improved significantly  and he became gradually less tachycardic and hypoxic. He was discharged home on oral anticoagulation (warfarin) and counseled on the importance of medication adherence  healthy lifestyle  and regular follow-up.  Given that this is his first episode of unprovoked PE  further work-up for hypercoagulability  including cancer screening  was planned on follow-up.  Conclusion:  Overall  John's presentation of acute onset breathlessness and chest pain post a long-haul flight  raised suspicion of a pulmonary embolism  later confirmed by elevated D-dimer levels and CT pulmonary angiogram.  It is vital to consider the medical and family history  lifestyle  and presenting symptoms when approaching differential diagnoses. Quick diagnostic work-up and prompt initiation of anticoagulation therapy are indispensable in managing such cases effectively to improve outcome and decrease morbidity and mortality.
9,9,83,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial83,Patient Presentation:  Subject: Mrs. Jane Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the ER complaining of sudden shortness of breath together with sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsened with deep breaths.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Doe is a known hypertensive and diabetic patient. She also has a history of chronic bronchitis. All conditions are properly managed with medications. Due to her decreased mobility  she has a high BMI (32.8 kg/m2)  she is labeled as obese. In the past  she was treated for a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) post a total knee replacement surgery two years ago. She has an allergy to penicillin.  Family History: She has a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases. Her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 50  and her mother died of stroke at the age of 72. Mrs. Doe has one sibling  a younger sister diagnosed with hypertension.  Social History: She is a retired school teacher living with her husband. She is a non-smoker and has a moderate consumption of alcohol. She has no history of illicit drug use.   Current Episode: The patient commented that the symptoms started abruptly a few hours ago when she was watching television. The pain does not radiate and there is no associated nausea  vomiting  sweating  or syncope. The review of systems was otherwise negative.   Physical examination: The patient appeared anxious  diaphoretic with notable tachypnea. Her blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  pulse rate was 110 beats per minute. Auscultation of her lungs revealed decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung.  Based on her symptoms  history  and physical examination  a provisional diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism was made. D-dimer test was ordered  which came back positive. A confirmatory CT pulmonary angiogram was performed  which indeed confirmed the presence of a clot in the left pulmonary artery.   Plan: Mrs. Doe is started on IV heparin and will continue on warfarin post-discharge for three months.

Past Medical History: Mr. Davis has been on medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol for the past ten years. He also had a total knee replacement surgery two months ago  from which he is still recovering.  Family History: Heart disease and hypertension run in Mr. Davis' family; both his father and his older brother had heart disease and died of heart attacks  his mother had a stroke  and an aunt had a DVT a few years ago.  Clinical Findings & Diagnostics: ECG displayed right heart strain and an elevated troponin level. Chest CT angiogram demonstrated a large clot in the right pulmonary artery. D-dimer test was also elevated. Hemoglobin levels were marginally decreased  and CBC showed mild leukocytosis. The patient's oxygen saturation level was found to be 92%  lower than the acceptable range.  Diagnosis & Treatment: Based on the clinical history  symptoms  and diagnostic findings  Mr. Davis was diagnosed with Acute Pulmonary Embolism. Immediately after the diagnosis  he was started on unfractionated heparin with plans to bridging to warfarin. His vital signs were stabilized  and oxygen was administered.  Hospital Course: In the subsequent two days in the hospital  the patient's symptoms considerably improved with a stabilized heart rate and increased oxygen saturation level. He was educated on the use of warfarin  the importance of regular International Normalized Ratio (INR) check-ups  and the course of treatment.  Patient Disposition & Follow-Up: Mr. Davis was discharged after four days  on continued Warfarin therapy. He was instructed to return for follow-up in one week to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment and monitor for any side-effects or recurrence of symptoms.  Bearing in mind the patient's joint surgery and family history of thromboembolism  it was decided to recommend genetic testing for thrombophilias once his anticoagulation therapy is completed. The importance of regular ambulation and active living was stressed to Mr. Davis before discharge to prevent the likelihood of any future thrombotic events.

9,9,88,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial88,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 68-year-old African American male with a medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain. The pain was described as sharp  worse upon inspiration. There were no other associated symptoms like fever  cough  or hemoptysis. He is a retired truck driver and lives with his wife. He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol only on social occasions. He denies any illicit drug use. His current medications include warfarin for DVT and amlodipine for his hypertension.  He has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father having died from a myocardial infarction in his 60s  and his mother diagnosed with congestive heart failure in her late 70s.  On physical examination  he was observed to be in moderate respiratory distress  with increased respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation was 92% while breathing room air. Breath sounds were decreased on the right lower side. His heart rate was elevated with normal rhythm  and blood pressure was slightly elevated (150/90 mmHg). No leg swelling or signs of DVT were evident on physical examination.  Initial laboratory results showed an elevated D-dimer level. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with no specific ST-T changes. Given his symptomatology and history of DVT  a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was ordered  which confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral pulmonary embolism.  The patient was immediately started on heparin treatment  and his warfarin was held. He was placed on oxygen therapy to improve his oxygenation. The case was discussed with the hematologist for future placement of an inferior vena cava filter given his history of recurrent DVT and now pulmonary embolism.  Mr. J’s case highlights the need for vigilant monitoring and control of risk factors in patients with a history of DVT  especially in those with a familial history of cardiovascular disease. Optimization of anticoagulation therapy is crucial in such cases to prevent life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolisms.
9,9,89,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial89,Patient Presentation   Patient Details: Ms. Elizabeth Jacobs  60-year-old Caucasian female  presents to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath and intermittent chest pain for the last 48 hours.  Presenting Symptoms: Ms. Jacobs reports experiencing sudden shortness of breath even while at rest  along with chest pain that's non-radiating in nature. She characterizes the chest pain as 'stabbing' mainly during deep inhalation. She also noted episodes of coughing spells sometimes with streaks of blood.  Past Medical History: Ms. Jacobs has a known history of systemic hypertension controlled by medication (amlodipine 10mg once daily). She also has a history of surgery for an ovarian cyst removal (uncomplicated) 15 years ago. She does not have diabetes or heart disease and is a non-smoker. She stays relatively active for her age and is not obese (BMI:22).  Family History: Both her parents died at old age due to cardiac issues. Her mother had a history of stroke at the age of 75. She also has a younger brother diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis (DVT).   Investigations: On physical examination  she appeared anxious  sweating  and was in respiratory distress. Her vital signs demonstrated tachycardia (Heart Rate: 110 beats/minute) and hypoxia (Oxygen Saturation: 90%). The ECG showed sinus tachycardia without any ST-T changes.   Lab results revealed an elevated D-dimer. Her blood reports indicate marginally high Troponin level but normal renal function. A CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. A Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities indicated no signs of DVT.  Management: Ms. Jacobs was started on oxygen therapy and anticoagulant therapy (Low-molecular-weight heparin). She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and further management.  Risk Factors: Given her family history of DVT and her own personal history of surgery  Ms. Jacobs is at increased risk of developing a blood clot. Her condition may have been triggered due to her sedentary lifestyle following her recent ankle sprain which limited her mobility for some weeks.  Brief Summary: This is the case of a 60-year-old female with a previous medical history significant for hypertension and surgery with recent decreased activity levels. She presented with symptoms of acute shortness of breath and chest pain. Investigations corroborated the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. She's currently on anticoagulant therapy under close monitoring in the ICU. Her condition draws attention to the importance of monitoring post-operative and immobilized patients for signs of thromboembolic events  even years after the surgery.

9,9,91,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial91,Patient Information:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presents with sudden onset shortness of breath  chest pain  and fevers. His past medical history is significant for hypertension  type II diabetes  and obesity. He reports a sedentary lifestyle and a 30-pack-year smoking history. He has a family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE)  with his father having had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at the age of 58.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient reported a recent gradual onset of fatigue and dyspnea  but related that his symptoms dramatically worsened over the past 48 hours. He also reported a recent episode of coughing up blood-tinged sputum. The patient attributed his ongoing fatigue and early dyspnea to progression of age.  Investigations:  Electrocardiography reveals a sinus tachycardia. Imaging reports a chest computed tomography (CT) scan showing signs consistent with an acute pulmonary embolism. Blood tests indicate an elevated D-dimer level. His oxygen saturation is decreased to 88% in room air.   Diagnosis:  Based on the presenting symptoms  imaging investigation  and blood results  the patient was diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism. The presence of the risk factors  such as obesity  smoking  a sedentary lifestyle  and family history of VTE  increased the index of suspicion.  Management:  The patient was started on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and later transitioned to oral anticoagulation in the hospital setting. Patient counseling was initiated to explain the severity of the condition and the importance of medication compliance and lifestyle modifications.  Complications:  Due to late presentation  the patient developed right-sided heart strain/risk of pulmonary hypertension; repeated echocardiography would be needed to monitor this.  Prognosis:  The patient remains at an elevated risk of recurrent PE and DVT due to his multiple risk factors. Long-term management will depend on therapeutic response  medication tolerance  and patient compliance with lifestyle modifications.  Follow-Up:  The patient will be required to have regular follow up appointments with a pulmonologist and cardiologist to ensure his PE has resolved  manage potential complications and evaluate the need for extended anticoagulation therapy. He has also been referred to a smoking cessation program and a dietitian to help with weight loss and lifestyle modification.
9,9,92,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial92,Patient Information:   The patient is a 58-year-old African American male  a retired military officer  currently living alone. He was brought to the emergency department by his neighbor after he complained of sudden-onset shortness of breath and chest pain. He has been reportedly losing weight for the last couple of weeks. He denies any history of fever  trauma  cough  or hemoptysis.   Past Medical History:   The patient is known to have multiple comorbidities  which include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) for which he has failed to maintain an optimal INR on Warfarin. He has a history of DVT on his left leg 3 years ago.   Family History:  According to patient  his father died at age 63 due to myocardial infarction and his mother died at 58 due to cerebral vascular attack. He has 2 siblings  one of them known to have hypertension and the other one with diabetes. He is non-alcoholic and a former smoker with no illicit drug use.  Clinical Findings:  The oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry was 88% on room air. The BP was elevated at 160/90mmHg  heart rate 110 beats/min  and respiratory rate 24/min. On examination  he was found sweaty and in considerable distress. Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm. There was edema and erythema of the left lower extremity  but both limbs were warm.  Investigations:  Chest X-ray didn't reveal any significant lung pathology. The patient showed a marked increase in D-dimer level based on lab results. An ECG was indicative of an S1Q3T3 pattern  raising suspicion for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of PE.  Management:  Given the patient's uncontrolled AF  history of DVT  and weight loss  he was admitted to the hospital under the cardiology service for the management of the PE and further investigation of weight loss  with consideration for malignancy. He was started on a full dose of low molecular weight heparin(LMWH) as a bridge to oral anticoagulation  provided that there is no contraindication. Given the possibility of malignancy  a hematology/oncology consultation was also requested for further management.   Prognosis:  He is currently stable but acutely ill  with guarded prognosis due to underlying comorbidities and the acute PE. It should be noted that early and fast detection is key in the successful management of patients with PE  which can be life-threatening if left untreated. We will need to ensure optimized management of his COAD and AF  with a focus on the INR range to avoid the risks of thrombotic and bleeding events in the future.   This case highlights the importance of considering PE in patients presenting with sudden shortness of breath  particularly in patients with risk factors such as AF and a previous history of DVT. Although most patients with PE present with dyspnea  chest pain  or syncope  some symptoms can be quite vague  and maintaining a high index of suspicion is essential to prompt diagnosis and treatment.

He is a non-smoker and controls his moderate alcohol consumption. The patient is married  self-employed  enjoys cycling  and has no history of drug use.   Past medical history:  The patient had an appendectomy at the age of 22. His medical history includes hypertension  which is well-managed with Amlodipine 5mg once a day. He has no known allergies.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient reported acute onset of shortness of breath  chest pain that worsened on deep inspiration  and light-headedness. He denied any symptoms related to lower limb pain or swelling. His symptoms occurred suddenly while working at his desk.  Family History:   The patient's father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 55  and his mother has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Otherwise  the family history is negative for thrombosis-related conditions.  Physical Examination:  On examination  his blood pressure was slightly elevated (150/95 mmHg). His heart rate was regular but slightly tachycardic at 110 bpm. He was afebrile with oxygen saturation of 92%. There was no lower limb swelling or tenderness  and cardiovascular and abdominal examination were unremarkable.   Diagnostic Assessment:  Working in consideration of the symptoms and risk factors  PE was suspected. His D-dimer test was remarkably high. CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) confirmed the presence of multiple clots in both pulmonary arteries  therefore confirming the diagnosis of acute PE.  Management and Outcome:  He was started on anticoagulant therapy with Enoxaparin injections and afterward switched to long-term oral anticoagulant therapy with Warfarin for the prevention of recurrent PE. Statins were added for his hypertension. He was also advised for lifestyle changes.  Prognosis and Follow-up:  The patient responded well to the aforementioned treatment regimen. His symptoms resolved over a period of a few weeks. He was encouraged to make lifestyle modifications and was scheduled for regular follow-ups and blood tests to monitor his condition and anticoagulation status.  Ethical Considerations:  The patient provided informed consent for all the diagnostic procedures and management plans incorporated into his care. He was given detailed information about the diagnosis  possible complications  and treatment plan.  This case underlines the importance of considering PE as one of the differential diagnoses when dealing with sudden-onset shortness of breath and unexplained tachycardia  further emphasizing the value of careful history evaluation and examination in clinical practices. 
9,9,94,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial94,Patient Presentation  Patient Profile:  G.M. is a 68-year-old African American male who currently resides in Austin  Texas. He is a retired mechanic who lives with his wife. He appears anxious and visibly distressed due to his difficulty in breathing.   Medical History:  Patient has a notable medical history of hypertension managed with Lisinopril and Aspirin for the past 10 years. No history of surgeries or other significant diseases. Also  he has a history of occasional alcohol use and smoking for 40 years.   Chief Complaint:  His initial complaint was a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath  chest pain  and lightheadedness that has persisted for a few hours.  Preliminary Diagnosis & Testing:  Based on the presenting symptoms and risk factors  a preliminary diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was suspected. In order to support the diagnosis  a D-dimer test was ordered revealing significantly elevated levels. Given the severity of symptoms  a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was subsequently performed  confirming the presence of a pulmonary embolism.   Family History:  Patient’s family history reveals a father who died from a stroke at 78 and a mother who died from congestive heart failure at 82. The patient has two siblings: an older brother with diabetes and a younger sister with no significant health issues.  Social History:  Patient is currently retired and lives with his wife. He enjoys reading  gardening  and spending time with his grandchildren. The patient has a 40 pack-year history from smoking (two packs per day for 20 years)  but quit smoking 5 years ago. He occasionally drinks alcohol but denies any illicit drug use.  Treatment Plan:  He was put on anticoagulants  with a low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) for immediate effect  along with warfarin therapy for long term management. The patient was also given supplemental oxygen and pain relief.  Patient education was done emphasizing on the need for regular follow-ups  medication compliance  diet  exercise  smoking cessation  and when to seek immediate medical attention. Patient and the wife verbalized understanding of the information.   Plan is to follow-up in the clinic next week.  This case underlines the importance of immediate recognition and treatment of pulmonary embolism to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. The patient's history of smoking and hypertension possibly contributed to his risk for developing a PE. Timely intervention and appropriate treatment have likely improved the patient's prognosis  but continued education and support regarding lifestyle modifications are essential.
9,9,95,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial95,Patient Profile: Mr. Peter Xavier  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the ER with complaints of sudden onset sharp chest pain radiating to the shoulder  accompanied by shortness of breath and light-headedness. The patient reports a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) seven years ago. He works as an accountant and admits to a sedentary lifestyle. He is a former smoker  having quit five years ago  drinks social alcohol  and denies any drug use. The family history reveals that his father had an ischemic stroke at the age of 67.  On examination  he was anxious  with a pulse rate of 115 bpm  blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/minute  and SpO2 of 92% on room air. Physical examination was otherwise normal  and no leg swelling noted.  He was immediately given oxygen support via nasal cannula  and labs were ordered. His D-dimer level was significantly elevated. An ECG didn't show any signs of ischemia. Chest X-Ray didn't show any significant abnormalities. However  a CT pulmonary angiography revealed a thrombus in the right pulmonary artery  confirming the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  The patient seemed to be stable without any signs of compromise in the functioning of his heart  placing him under a category of submassive (intermediate-risk) pulmonary embolism.   We started the patient on anticoagulation therapy with parenteral heparin and oral apixaban. No thrombolytic agents were used considering his current risk classification and potential risk of bleeding.   Considering his sedentary lifestyle and history of DVT  he was recommended lifestyle modifications and physical activities like regular walking and leg exercises to promote blood flow.  The patient responded well to the treatment and showed improvement in symptoms within a matter of days. His oxygen saturation levels returned to normal and respiration rate slowed. He was discharged on lifelong oral anticoagulants and has been scheduled for regular follow-ups to monitor his progress and drug side effects if any.  A discussion on a genetic predisposition to thrombosis has been opened with the patient and family  advising genetic counseling and screening for hereditary thrombophilias for his children considering his familial history of stroke and personal history of DVT and pulmonary embolism.
9,9,96,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial96,"Case Presentation  Patient Information:   Mr. Richardson  a 67-year-old African American male  was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute shortness of breath  chest pain  and mild dizziness. He describes the pain as """"sharp"""" in nature  located on the right side of his chest and worsening with deep breaths. His wife reported that he had been increasingly fatigued over the past week  with intermittent cough but no hemoptysis or fever.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Richardson has a 10-year history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He had been a heavy cigarette smoker for 25 years before quitting 15 years ago. He had a lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) five years back and was on warfarin therapy for six months.  Family History:   His mother died of myocardial infarction in her late 50s. His father had a stroke and was also diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension. He has one sibling  a brother  also diagnosed with hypertension.  Review of Systems (ROS):  Negative for nausea  vomiting  and abdominal pain  but he endorses recent leg swelling (right > left).  Physical Examination:  Upon arrival  he was afebrile with a heart rate of 110 bpm  BP of 170/95 mmHg  respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. His BMI was noted to be 29. Examination revealed decreased breath sounds on the right side and swollen  tender right lower limb. Cardiac examination was notable for tachycardia but no murmurs. The rest of the physical examination was within normal limits.  Investigations:  A d-dimer was significantly raised. Chest X-ray was unremarkable  and a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed bilateral multiple pulmonary emboli. An ultrasound of the lower limbs detected a DVT in the right leg.  Diagnosis:  Acute pulmonary embolism probably secondary to deep venous thrombosis.   Treatment:  Given his hypoxia  tachycardia  and extent of clot burden  Mr. Richardson was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring and was started on therapeutic intravenous heparin. Warfarin therapy was also recommenced.  Discussion:  This case is an example of acute pulmonary embolism  particularly concerning due to the patient's extensive clot size and the history of previous DVT. Management should include anticoagulation therapy with attention to improving his hyperlipidemia  hypertension  and diabetes control for overall cardiovascular risk reduction. His case serves as a reminder that we carefully evaluate each patient for risk factors of thrombotic episodes and consider early therapeutic interventions."
9,9,97,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial97,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who goes by the name of Mr. Smith. He is a retired army officer  with a medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  diagnosed approximately seven years ago  for which he had discontinued the prescribed anticoagulant therapy against medical advice. He was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago and is being treated with oral hypoglycemic agents. He had quit smoking 10 years ago and carries a 20 pack-year history. He does not consume alcohol. He leads a sedentary life since his retirement two years ago. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease with his father passing away at the age of 55 due to a heart attack and his elder sibling being diagnosed with heart disease at an early age of 50 years.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Smith presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of breathlessness and sharp  stabbing chest pain radiating to his back  exacerbated on deep inspiration. The patient also reported experiencing light-headedness and a fainting episode earlier in the day.   Clinical Findings:  On initial evaluation  Mr. Smith had a blood pressure of 145/100  a heart rate of 110 bpm (tachycardia)  respiration rate of 26 breaths/minute (tachypnea)  oxygen saturation 90% on room air and was afebrile. On physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and was in acute respiratory distress. He presented with signs of right heart strain. No leg swelling or tenderness was noted.  Investigations:  Laboratory findings showed elevated D-dimer levels indicative of thrombus formation. A chest computed tomography (CT) with contrast immediately performed confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) with blockage observed in both the main pulmonary arteries. An echocardiogram revealed right ventricular dysfunction consistent with PE. The blood glucose level was mildly elevated. His EKG showed tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern suggestive of acute PE.  Treatment Plan:  Our patient was immediately commenced on anticoagulant therapy via Low Molecular Weight Heparin administration to prevent further clotting and oral Warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. The lack of hemodynamic instability ruled out the need for thrombolytic therapy.   Outcome:  The patient responded well to the initial treatment  showing improvement in breathlessness and chest discomfort. Long term  Mr. Smith will require close monitoring of his INR (International Normalized Ratio)  continuous diabetic control  and lifestyle modifications to manage his PE condition. He has also been advised to maintain his anti-coagulation therapy to mitigate the risk of recurrence.

Medical History: Mr. Smith has been managing his pre-existing conditions of hypertension and type 2 diabetes well with regular insulin injections and diet regulation for the latter and hypertensive medication (Lisinopril) for the former. Moreover  he was diagnosed with DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) in his left leg 3 years ago. Over the past year  he reported frequent episodes of chest pain but attributed it to acid reflux.  Family History: He has a family history of cardiac diseases; his father died from a myocardial infarction at age 70  and his older brother  who is 70 years old  underwent a bypass surgery two years ago.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  he appeared uncomfortable and cyanotic. He had an increased respiratory rate (24 breaths per minute) and tachycardia (112 beats per minute). Blood pressure was noted as 145/90mmHg  and oxygen saturation was 89% on room air  indicating low oxygen levels in the blood.   Investigations/Lab results: Lab results demonstrated elevated levels of D-dimer - 1 200 ng/mL (normal range <500 ng/mL). A subsequent CT scan confirmed the presence of blood clots in the pulmonary artery.  Provisional Diagnosis: Based on his symptoms and lab results  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.  Management: He was immediately put on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula to relieve hypoxia and started on anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Considering his family history of cardiac diseases and his elevated BP  a beta-blocker was also introduced to manage his tachycardia.  Conclusion: Mr. Smith's case indicates the importance of vigilance in patients with a history of DVT and co-morbid conditions like hypertension and diabetes since they are at a higher risk for developing Pulmonary embolism. Earlier suspicious signs of chest pains should've been investigated thoroughly. It also highlights the requirement for regular check-ups and adherence to medication for such patients due to their increased susceptibility to severe conditions like PE.
9,9,99,diagnosis9-prompt9-trial99,Patient Profile: Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old male  Caucasian. He is a retired engineer  married  with two adult children. He lives in suburban Midwest and is mainly sedentary.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Doe was admitted to the emergency department presenting with acute onset of chest pain  shortness of breath  and blood-streaked sputum for the last six hours.  Past Medical History: He has a 10-year history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and hypertension and was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia five years ago. He is a former smoker  with a 20-pack-year smoking history  and quit smoking 15 years ago.   Family History: His father died of a heart attack at the age of 62  but a detailed family history report shows no known inherited thrombophilic conditions.  Current Medications: He is currently taking Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.  Investigations: On examination  he had a heart rate of 105 bpm  a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. His blood pressure was measured as 140/90 mmHg. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia with a S1Q3T3 pattern. His D-Dimer level was elevated.   A CT pulmonary angiography was performed which confirmed the presence of a large clot in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery  clarifying the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  Management: Mr. Doe was immediately started on Oxygen therapy and low molecular weight heparin. Warfarin was also added to his treatment regimen for long-term anticoagulation. His previous medications were continued. His diet was optimized to control his glucose levels and efforts were made to improve control of his hypertension.  Given his history of hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  he is at high risk for a recurrent event  therefore strict control of his cardiovascular risk factors will be key to reducing this risk.  Follow-ups: He has regular follow-ups scheduled with endocrinology to manage his diabetes  cardiology for anticoagulation management and risk factor reduction  and his primary care provider for holistic wellness support.  In conclusion  Mr. Doe's ongoing management will be multi-disciplinary and will focus on managing his acute condition  optimizing his chronic disease management  and reducing his overall cardiovascular risk.

Past Medical History  Mr. J.D.'s medical history is significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Hypertension (HTN)  both of which are well-controlled with Metformin and Lisinopril respectively. He suffered from a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) five years ago and was on warfarin for several months at that time. He previously smoked but has been smoke-free for the past decade. He drinks occasionally.  Family History  Family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  as his father had a fatal myocardial infarction at 72 years old. His mother had Type 2 DM and succumbed to complications of a stroke at the age of 80. His elder brother is living with HTN and hyperlipidemia.  Clinical Course and Management  On physical examination  he was tachycardic (HR: 120 bpm) and tachypneic (RR: 25 breaths per min) with a blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg. Oxygen saturation was 90% on room air  and he had decreased breath sounds in the lower lobe of the right lung.  Laboratory results showed elevated D-dimer  while ECG revealed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of right heart strain. Chest X-ray appeared unremarkable  and a subsequent CT pulmonary angiography confirmed the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe.  The patient was initially stabilized with oxygen and intravenous fluids. Given his previous history of DVT and the acute pulmonary embolism  he was started on Low Molecular Weight Heparin. Anticoagulation was bridged to warfarin with a plan to continue it for at least 6 to 12 months in consultation with a hematologist.   Patient education about the importance of compliance with medication  regular follow-ups  and lifestyle modifications including moderate exercise and a healthy diet was also emphasized.   Outcome and Follow-up  The patient's condition improved gradually  and he was discharged home. Mr. J.D. is scheduled for a follow-up in 2 weeks to assess his response to the treatment and any potential side effects of medication.

9,10,20,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial20,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographics: Mr. Bolton  a 56-year-old African-American male  employed as an HR executive with a sedentary lifestyle  presents to the emergency department (ED).  Past Medical History: Mr. Bolton has a history of hypertension controlled with hydrochlorothiazide therapy  but he’s been non-compliant for the last couple of weeks. He had a below-knee cast applied for an un-displaced fracture of the left lower leg  sustained two weeks ago while playing golf. He has been overweight for the past 10 years with BMI of 29 kg/m2. There is no history of any genetic condition or thrombophilias. He is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption and no history of drug abuse.  Key Complaints: Mr. Bolton arrived at the ED complaining about a sudden onset of shortness of breath lasting for one hour  which exacerbated on physical exertion and concurrent moderate to severe pleuritic chest pain  located centrally and worsening with inspiration. He also reported an ongoing cough but no hemoptysis. Furthermore  he expressed uneasiness and anxiety about these new symptoms.  On examination  he was anxious  with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Blood pressure was 140/90mmHg  pulse 98 beats per minute and temperature 98.6°F. No cyanosis or clubbing was noted. Chest examination revealed tachycardia but was clinically clear  and heart sounds were normal. Systemic examination was unremarkable except for tenderness over his left calf  which was also slightly swollen.  This symptomatology  especially in light of Mr. Bolton's recent immobility and history of hypertension  suggests a potential for acute pulmonary embolism. Investigations including ECG  arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis  D-dimer tests and confirmatory imaging should be ordered to allow diagnosis and timely treatment of this potentially life-threatening condition.
9,10,21,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial21,Patient Information:  Name: Mr. James Smith Age: 65 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Banker Smoking Status: Ex-smoker (quit 10 years ago) Alcohol consumption: Social drinker  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a known history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) following a hip replacement surgery 5 years ago. He is managed on daily tablets of aspirin 81 mg by his primary healthcare provider. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia controlled with statins and mild hypertension managed with lifestyle modifications. He has no known allergies.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Smith presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of difficulty breathing that started a couple of hours ago while he was at home reading a book. He further reported that his shortness of breath has been accompanied by a sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsens with deep breaths. He also experienced an episode of fainting  prompting the visit to the hospital. He denies any history of cough  fever  or recent travels.  Intended Learning Outcomes:  Medical students should understand the presentation  risk factors  diagnosis  and management of an acute pulmonary embolism. They should appreciate the importance of history taking and physical examination in making a confident clinical diagnosis. Further  they should understand the role of appropriate investigations in confirming the diagnosis and ruling out other differential diagnoses for acute shortness of breath. Finally  they should be aware of the principles of acute and long-term management  including anticoagulation therapy. In this patient's case  they should discuss the risk-benefit of long-term aspirin therapy for DVT prophylaxis.   Teaching points and tips:   - Risk factors for pulmonary embolism (Barring any genetic predisposition  relevant risk factors in the patient include a previous DVT  recent surgery  age  and sedentary lifestyle). - Clinical manifestations of pulmonary embolism (sudden onset of shortness of breath  sharp stabbing chest pain  lightheadedness  possibly syncope). - Appreciation of the broad differential diagnoses in a patient with similar presenting complaints  including myocardial infarction  pneumothorax  pneumonia  and acute pericarditis. - Understanding the importance and urgency of obtaining imaging (like a CT pulmonary angiogram) to confirm the diagnosis of PE. - Understanding the principles of management including immediate anticoagulation with heparin  followed by long-term anticoagulation. - Awareness of potential complications if left untreated. - Importance of patient education in PE risk factors and symptoms  for early presentation and treatment.
9,10,22,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial22,Case Report:  Patient Details: Mr. A is a 63-year-old male  nondiabetic  nonsmoker  who presents to the Emergency Department (ED). He is an accountant by profession with no specific occupational hazards. He is not on any chronic medication.  Past Medical History: Mr. A has a past medical history of hypertension  controlled with daily medication for the past 15 years. He had a right total knee arthroplasty three weeks ago. He has no history of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He does not have a family history of PE  DVT  or bleeding disorders. He does not take any illicit drugs. His last routine check-up  two months ago  was unremarkable.   Chief Complaints: He came to the ED complaining of progressive  acute onset  sharp chest pain since the last 4 hours. The pain is localized in the middle third of the chest without radiation  increasing on inspiration  rated 6 on a pain scale from 0 to 10. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath and mild dizziness. He denies symptoms like fever  chill  cough  leg pain  swelling  abdominal pain  nausea  vomiting  or other gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient did not encounter any known allergens  nor did he have any physical exertion or emotional upset prior to the onset of the symptoms.   Although this is a hypothetical case  it is a classic representation of an acute pulmonary embolism presentation. The patient's recent surgery  along with continuous inactive position  places him at a high risk for this disorder. The medical students should be educated on the significance of immediate clinical evaluation using necessary imaging studies and lab tests in such a scenario to rule out life-threatening situations. Instituting appropriate therapy as rapidly as possible is needed to prevent morbidity and mortality.

He also has a history of hypertension  managed well with medication  and obesity with a BMI of 32. He was an active smoker but quit 5 years ago. There is no significant family history of venous thromboembolism.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Jones presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath that had developed over a few hours. He described a sharp  localized chest pain on the left side that becomes worse with deep breaths. He also reported a mild cough  but with no hemoptysis and has had episodes of light-headedness and rapid heart rate. He denies any leg pain or recent travel.  The objective is to train students to discern the symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism:   1. Shortness of breath: This often occurs suddenly and always gets worse with exertion. 2. Chest pain: Patient may experience pleuritic chest pain or chest discomfort that becomes worse when you take a deep breath and may also get worse with exertion. 3. Cough: This might produce bloody or blood-streaked sputum. 4. Tachycardia or rapid heart rate.  Immediate actions should include arranging for a CT pulmonary angiogram to confirm the diagnosis and blood tests to assess the heart's function. Anticoagulant treatment should also be initiated.  Clinical follow-up should include adjustment of anticoagulant dosage  monitoring recurrence of symptoms  and patient education regarding the prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and hence pulmonary embolism. The students should also be trained to advise such patients about weight loss and the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

He works as a part-time professor in a local college.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his left leg 5 years ago  managed with oral anticoagulants. He has a history of hypertension  well controlled on a low dose of amlodipine. He had been relatively fit until the DVT incident  with no history of pulmonary diseases. He also underwent a hernia repair surgery 2 years ago. His mother died at 72 due to myocardial infarction and his father had a stroke in his late 60s.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Johnson visits the emergency clinic and presents with sudden onset of shortness of breath that started a few hours before coming to the ER. He also complains of a sharp  stabbing chest pain on the right side that exacerbates with deep breathing. He admits to feeling lightheaded and has been increasingly fatigued over the past week or so. He also says that he has noticed his left leg being slightly swollen and warmer than usual.  On examination  he appears anxious and diaphoretic. His heart rate is high at 110 beats per minute  and his respirations are quick and shallow at 24 breaths per minute. Blood pressure is stable at 140/85mmHg. Pulse oximetry shows his oxygen saturation at 91% despite being on room air.  Given this information  medical students should think of potential diagnoses  including acute pulmonary embolism  especially considering his relevant past medical history of DVT and his new  severe symptoms. Clinical reasoning and subsequent management for his condition can then be discussed.
9,10,31,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial31,Patient Information:  Name : J.K. Age : 55 Sex : Female Marital status : Married Address : Portland  Oregon Occupation : Administrative Assistant  Patient History:   J.K. is a 55-year-old Caucasian female with a known history of obesity  varicose veins  and hypercholesterolemia. She had a total hip replacement surgery approximately two weeks prior. She is a former smoker  having quit five years prior with a 15 pack-year history. She is currently on rivaroxaban for prevention of deep vein thrombosis post-surgery.  Presenting Complaints:  1) She has been experiencing sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain since morning  which is aggravated upon taking deep breaths.  2) She also mentioned suffering from a dry cough and episodes of hemoptysis.  3) She remarked having a mild fever over the past two days  which she initially dismissed as post-operative inflammation.  4) She has been feeling lightheaded and has had episodes of fainting.  5) Her family has also noted that her skin is paler than usual.  Assessments:  Given her recent history of major surgery  current use of a blood thinner  history of obesity and varicose veins  the symptoms suggest that this patient could potentially have an acute pulmonary embolism. The shortness of breath  chest pain  cough with hemoptysis  and hypotension (suggested by fainting and pallor) all point towards this diagnosis.  Next Steps:  1) Immediate attention to stabilize her condition should be taken.  2) Additional testing (D-Dimer  CT Pulmonary Angiography  blood tests for troponins etc) and specialist consults would be initiated on a priority basis to confirm the diagnosis.  3) Depending on test results  initiate appropriate treatment which may include anticoagulant therapy  thrombolysis or embolectomy.

9,10,61,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial61,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male. He and his wife recently moved to Florida after he retired. His wife reports that he has been generally healthy and active  enjoying golf and regular walking. He has never smoked  drinks alcohol occasionally  and does not use any illicit substances. He is currently not taking any regular medication.  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which has been well controlled without medication. His family history revealed that his father died of a heart attack at the age of 70  and his mother has great blood pressure at the age of 89. He underwent a routine colonoscopy five years ago  which was normal. He has been noted to have a slightly elevated cholesterol in the past but has been managed conservatively due to his active lifestyle.  Key Complaints: The patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset dyspnea and mild pleuritic chest pain started in the morning  while he was taking a stroll around his neighborhood. Accompanying symptoms include light-headedness  rapid heart rate  and excessive sweating.   He noticed his symptoms got worse over a couple of hours  especially the shortness of breath  to the point where he felt he was unable to carry on with his regular walk. He denied any other symptoms  including fever  cough  sputum production  hemoptysis  wheezing  leg swelling  or recent long-distance travel.  He drove himself to the ED when his symptoms did not improve after resting at home. Upon presentation  he did not appear in acute distress but was anxious about his symptoms.   In conclusion  given the sudden onset of dyspnea  pleuritic chest pain and risk factor of hypertension  acute pulmonary embolism should be considered and immediate further evaluations should be arranged.
9,10,62,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial62,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: Name: Mr. A Sex: Male Age: 62 years Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting Complaint: The patient was presented to the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath  which had been persistent for the past few hours. He also reports having sharp  localized chest pain  worsened by deep breathing or coughing. He also remarked that he noticed his heart racing a couple of times that day.  Medical History: Mr. A is an ex-smoker and has been diagnosed with hypertension under control with medication (Ramipril) for nine years. About 4 years ago  Mr. A suffered a major stroke resulting in perennial weakness of the right side of his body. Since then  his mobility has been limited  often requiring a wheelchair for movement. The patient also has a familial history of coagulation disorders (mother with Factor V Leiden).  Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. A appeared to be in distress due to difficulty breathing. His heart rate was 115 beats per minute  blood pressure: 140/90 mm Hg  respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 89% on room air. The chest examination revealed tachycardia with no added sounds. The rest of the examination was unremarkable  with no leg swelling or tenderness noticed.  This clinical scenario  therefore  outlines the case of a patient showing symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism that the medical students must reason through  basing their hypotheses on the patient's complaints  past medical history  risk factors  and the initial findings of the physical examination. The case also provides students the opportunity to unveil the proper emergency treatment approach and management of acute pulmonary embolism. 
9,10,63,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial63,Case Report:  Patient Identification: 72-year-old African American man  Past Medical History: - Hypertension (managed with Metoprolol 50mg daily for the last 10 years) - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 10 years (on Metformin 1000mg twice daily) - Hyperlipidemia (on Atorvastatin 40mg daily) - Ex-smoker (quit 5 years ago  smoked pack per day for 30 years) - Had a right hip replacement surgery four weeks ago due to arthritis and currently undergoing physiotherapy sessions.   Presenting Complaints: Over the past two days  the patient experienced sudden onset of sharp  localized right-sided chest pain. The pain is severe  rated as 8 on a scale of 10  increasing with deep breathing and occasionally radiating to the right arm. Associated symptoms include episodes of palpitations  light-headedness  and persisting shortness of breath even while at rest. The mentioned symptoms were combined with cold  clammy skin  fatigue  and a minor bout of anxiety. He denies any cough  fever  hemoptysis  or recent infections.  Upon examination  he was found to be in respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  with an oxygen saturation of 89% on room air. His pulse rate was 110 beats per minute  and blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg.   Please consider this case as an example of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Key points to discuss would include early vigilance for symptoms of PE in patients who have major risk factors such as recent surgery  immobility  advanced age  hypertension  and history of smoking. Discussion on immediate management  stable versus unstable PE  and long-term thromboprophylaxis would also be safe venues to explore in this case.   This case could help to train medical students in making a quick assessment  recognizing high-risk patients  rational decision-making  and effective planning for immediate and long-distance medical care.
9,10,64,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial64,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Mr. James Brown  a 65-year-old Caucasian male.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Brown has a history of hypertension managed with Lisinopril. He recently underwent a total right hip replacement two months ago.

9,10,72,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial72,Case Report:  Patient's Information: Name: [Anonymous] Age: 68 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Medical Background: The patient has a history of Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension. His diabetes is controlled by oral hypoglycemic agents and hypertension is controlled by ACE inhibitors. He is also a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago. The patient also experienced a right hip fracture two weeks ago and has been relatively immobile. He has been on prophylactic low molecular weight heparin.  Chief Complaints: The patient reported to the emergency department  complaining of sudden onset of breathlessness for the past 4 hours  accompanied by sharp  right-sided chest pain which is exacerbated by deep inspiration. He additionally reported a cough with blood-tinged sputum and the feeling of palpitations in his chest. He denies fever  chills  or recent illness.  Objective Assessment: On physical examination  the patient appeared anxious and breathless. His vital signs were noted to be BP: 155/95 mmHg  Pulse: 105 beats per minute with occasional missed beats  Respirations: 22 breaths per minute  Oxygen saturation: 92% on room air. On auscultation  breath sounds were reduced in the right lower lung field and his heart rate was tachycardic. No murmurs were noted.  This hypothetical patient shows signs and symptoms that could align with an acute pulmonary embolism. The preceding major surgery and immobility  along with his other risk factors of age  hypertension  and history of smoking might have contributed to this condition  should it be the final diagnosis. It's recommended to further perform diagnostic tests including a D-dimer test  CT Pulmonary Angiography  or a ventilation/perfusion scan to confirm the condition.
9,10,73,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial73,Patient Information: Demographics: 65-year-old Caucasian male  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for 15 years and type 2 diabetes mellitus for approximately 5 years. He's a former smoker  and he quit smoking a decade ago. He is on an oral medication regimen consisting of Metformin (for diabetes)  Lisinopril (for hypertension)  and Atorvastatin (for hyperlipidemia).  Presenting Complaints: The patient presents with gradual onset shortness of breath that has progressively worsened over the last two days. He describes the feeling as gasping for air even at rest. He also reported intermittent episodes of sharp  localized chest pain intensified by deep breathing. He denied any associated symptoms like fever  cough  syncope  palpitations  leg pain  or recent travel.   Description: This case presents acute pulmonary embolism. The patient's presenting symptoms combined with risk factors like age  history of smoking and potential poor blood circulation from diabetes and hypertension are suggestive. The next step would be to confirm the diagnosis with methods such as a D-dimer test  CT pulmonary angiography  and possibly a V/Q scan depending on the patient's renal function. The purpose of this case is to teach medical students about recognizing the symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism and understanding the appropriate next steps for confirming diagnosis and treatment. Treatment considerations include anticoagulation  possibly thrombolysis  and addressing underlying risk factors to prevent recurrence.   Teaching points: 1. Importance of review of systems and past medical histories in patients with shortness of breath. 2. Understanding the risk factors for pulmonary embolism. 3. How to evaluate pulmonary embolism with various investigations. 4. Available treatment options for acute pulmonary embolism.   This case emphasizes the importance of considering potentially lethal differential diagnoses in patients presenting with common symptoms like shortness of breath.
9,10,74,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial74,Case Title: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Demographics: Mrs. Ruth Davies  a 62-year-old Caucasian female  residing in the city suburbs. She is a non-smoker and teetotaller  retired schoolteacher living with her supportive husband. Of late  she has mentioned that her physical activity level has significantly dropped due to lingering tiredness.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Davies has a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed 8 years ago  for which she has been taking a low-dose methotrexate and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as required. She is obese with a BMI of 32 and was diagnosed with type II Diabetes controlled by diet and Metformin. She also has controlled hypertension on low-dose hydrochlorothiazide. In addition  there is a history of recent surgery  a total knee replacement  carried out a week ago. Mrs. Davies has familial history of thromboembolic diseases  with her late mother suffering from deep-vein thrombosis (DVT).  Key Complaints: Mrs. Davies presented to ER complaining of sudden onset dyspnea  sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breaths  and a feeling of light-headedness. She also mentioned having a dry cough. On a closer inquiry  Mrs. Davies also reported an unexpected swelling in her right calf muscle along with localized tenderness and redness – features that commenced post her orthopedic surgery a week ago but were written off as post-surgical effects. She has correlating symptoms such as tachycardia (110/min) and tachypnea cantered around 23 breaths/min.   Given Mrs. Davies's recent medical history and presenting complaints  this case was approached with a high index of suspicion towards Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Further assessment with diagnostic tests was suggested.
9,10,75,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial75,Case Report - Acute Pulaneous Embolism  Patient Information:  Name: John Doe Age: 63 years old Gender: Male Occupation: Retired school teacher Race: Caucasian  Smoking Status: Ex-smoker (quit 10 years ago) Alcohol Consumption: Moderate Physical Activity: Sedentary  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension  controlled with medication (Lisinopril 20 mg daily) 2. Previous DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) event 5 years ago  managed with anticoagulant therapy 3. Type 2 diabetes (on Metformin 500mg twice daily) 4. 3-vessel CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting) performed eight years ago  Presenting Complaints:  John presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of:  1. Shortness of breath on exertion  2. Chest pain  which he describes as a 'heavy pressure' sensation  3. Some degree of light-headedness 4. Periodic coughing with blood-tinged sputum 5. Mild leg swelling and discomfort   Clinical Note:  Mr. Doe's previous history of DVT  along with his presenting symptoms  particularly the acute onset of shortness of breath  chest pain  and hemoptysis  raises a high suspicion of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE). His other comorbidities including hypertension  Type 2 diabetes  and coronary artery disease further increase his risk. Hence  immediate action towards diagnosis and management should be embarked upon with high suspicion for acute PE. This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing the signs and symptoms of PE  particularly in patients with a history of DVT or other hypercoagulable states. As future doctors  a high index of clinical suspicion and prompt management can often significantly improve the prognosis in such critical cases.

9,10,80,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial80,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: - Name: James Atkins - Age: 48-years-old - Sex: Male - Race: African American - Occupation: Truck driver  Past Medical History: Mr. Atkins is a smoker with a 20-pack per year history and has been previously diagnosed with hypertension which is managed with medication (Lisinopril 20 mg daily). He is overweight (BMI 28.3) and has a family history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism on his maternal side. He has never had a personal history of venous thromboembolism. No known allergies. He rarely exercises and spends the majority of his time sitting  either while working or at home.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Atkins presented to the emergency department in the early hours with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath  which started about two hours prior. He also reports feeling lightheaded and faint. He denies fever  cough  or hemoptysis. He said his chest pain is sharp  located at the center of the chest  and worsens with deep breaths. He rated his pain as 7 out of 10. He did not experience any alleviating or aggravating factors.   Given Mr. Atkins' risk factors  symptoms suggestive of pleuritic chest pain  and the episodic nature of his symptoms  acute pulmonary embolism should be high on the differential diagnosis list. This training case will focus on recognizing the symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism  understanding the risk factors  and managing the case with appropriate treatment plans.

Past Medical History: He has a known medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) one year prior  hypertension for the past 10 years  and atrial fibrillation diagnosed six months ago. He is on Warfarin for atrial fibrillation  Lisinopril for hypertension  and previously completed a course of anticoagulants post DVT diagnosis.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Smith is reporting sudden onset of shortness of breath that started earlier in the day. The patient describes it as feeling out of breath even with minimal exertion. Along with this  he also mentions a sharp  stabbing chest pain that worsens with deep breaths. He reports being lightheaded and an episode of fainting at home.  On querying further  he says he had recently completed a long car journey (around 12 hours) with minimal breaks for leg movements. He denies any cough  hemoptysis  fever  or leg swelling.  With this case  students should be made to consider an acute pulmonary embolism with differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome  aortic dissection  and pneumonia. Diagnostic procedures  treatment protocols  and prevention methods should be emphasized. Clinical reasoning and decision-making skills should be honed during the discussion of this case.
9,10,82,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial82,Patient Profile:  Name: Mrs. Smith  Age / Gender: 65-year-old woman  Ethnicity: Caucasian   Occupation: Retired teacher  Past Medical History:  - Hypertension  managed with ACE inhibitors. - Smoking history of two packs daily for 35 years.  - Recent laparoscopic total abdominal hysterectomy secondary to uterine fibroids  2 weeks ago.  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Smith presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset shortness of breath which has worsened over the last few hours. She also complains of pleuritic chest pain which increases in intensity upon coughing and deep inspiration. She denies experiencing any recent trauma.  She also mentions the observation of streaks of blood in her sputum once this morning. She reports a sudden-onset sharp  stabbing pain in her chest and palpitations. She expresses concern due to her lack of appetite  feeling weak and an unusual sense of looming anxiety.  No headaches  visual changes  slurring of speech  difficulty in understanding or expressing speech  or facial asymmetry have been reported indicating ruling out a cerebrovascular accident. No swelling  tenderness or redness over legs reported which might specify deep vein thrombosis.   Family History:  - Her mother died due to myocardial infarction at the age of 70.  - Her father survived a stroke in his 60s.   Physical Exam upon admission: - Vital signs: BP= 150/90 mmHg  HR= 110bpm  RR= 30 breaths per minute  SpO2= 88% on room air. - On general physical examination  she appears anxious. She is in acute distress  sitting upright in bed and breathing through pursed lips.  - Oxygen saturation is low despite having no history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  - On auscultation  breath sounds are normal with no crepitations or wheezes.  - Heart sounds are normal with no murmurs  rubs or gallops. - No lower limb swelling or redness is noticed.   This case study should provoke further investigations including arterial blood gas analysis  chest radiograph  electrocardiogram  D-dimer  and possibility of imaging for suspected pulmonary embolism such as a CT Pulmonary Angiogram. Students should consider the likelihood of PE given her recent surgery  smoking history  and the sudden onset of symptoms. The teaching case can also educate students about the importance of prophylaxis in high-risk patients to prevent such acute incidents. 
9,10,83,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial83,Case Report: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: Mr. Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department. He is a retired school teacher  non-smoker with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (managed through oral hypoglycemic agents) and obesity (BMI 30.5 kg/m2). He has no family history of clotting disorders. His only medication is metformin.  Key Complaints: He complains of chest discomfort of sudden onset  shortness of breath  and feeling lightheaded. He also reports a productive cough with blood-tinged sputum for the past few hours. Further inquiry reveals that Mr. Smith took a 12-hour flight about 72 hours ago  following which he has been mostly bedridden due to jet lag and fatigue. He has not reported any chest pain  palpitations  syncope  or other cardiac symptoms.  Assessment: Vital signs on admission are BP: 125/80 mmHg  HR: 110 bpm  RR: 25/min  and Temp: 37.2°C. He is anxious with noticeable diaphoresis. Initial physical examination reveals tachypnea and decreased breath sounds on the left side of his chest  with mild-to-moderate cyanosis of the lips and fingertips. There are no evident signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) such as leg swelling or pain on palpation.   This preliminary information is suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism  commonly associated with prolonged immobility such as a recent long-haul flight. Further investigations  including D-dimer tests  CT pulmonary angiography  and arterial blood gas study  would aid in confirming the diagnosis and initiating the most appropriate treatment regimen.  Considerations for discussion and learning points among medical students include risk factors for pulmonary embolism  understanding of Virchow’s triad  diagnostic process  medical and surgical treatment options  and preventive measures for patients at risk.

The learning objectives should focus on understanding risk factors for pulmonary embolism  learning to recognize the key clinical features  and how to initiate its diagnostic workup and management.
9,10,85,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial85,Patient Information:  NAME: Mr. John Doe   AGE: 62 years old  SEX: Male  ETHNICITY: Caucasian  OCCUPATION: Retired accountant  CASE DESCRIPTION:  Mr. John Doe  a 62-year-old retired accountant  presents to the ER with the main complaint of a sudden onset chest pain that started about 2 hours prior. He describes the pain as sharp and occurring mainly on the left side of his chest  and it worsens with deep breathing. He denies pressure-like pain that spreads to the arms  neck  jaw  or back. Along with chest pain  Mr. Doe also reports a recent episode of shortness of breath and moderate dizziness.  Over the past four days  he also noted a mild  intermittent cough with rust-colored mucus. He noticed some leg swelling on his left leg  mainly in the calf area  which has been seemingly persistent over the past week. He reports no hemoptysis  fevers  chills  or recent traumas  and no symptoms of upper respiratory infections.  Mr. Doe is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago with a 40-pack-year history prior to cessation. His past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are well-controlled with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin  respectively. Mr. Doe also had an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his left leg about five years ago after a long haul flight. His records indicate he had completed treatment with Warfarin at the time. He reports no known drug allergies.  He lives with his wife  their dog  and he enjoys gardening and short walks around the neighborhood for physical activity. His diet is balanced  but he admits to indulging in high-sodium and high-cholesterol foods occasionally. He reports moderate alcohol consumption  equivalent to 2-3 glasses of wine per week. He denies any illicit substance usage.  Mr. Doe's family history is significant for heart disease. His father had coronary artery disease and underwent a bypass surgery at the age of 68. His mother was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in her late 70s. His older brother has been recently diagnosed with peripheral artery disease.   Given his symptoms and personal and family medical history  acute pulmonary embolism could be a strong part of the differential diagnosis. Further diagnostic procedures must be conducted to confirm or reject the hypothesis  and to rule out any similar conditions.
9,10,86,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial86,Patient Information:  • Initials: J.D. • Gender: Female • Age: 67 years old • Ethnicity: African American  Past Medical History:   • Hypertension • Type 2 diabetes • Former smoker (quit 15 years ago; smoked 1 pack a day for 25 years) • Recent right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a long-haul flight; treated with a course of anticoagulants  but did not complete her medication regimen  Presenting Complaints:   J.D. presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of sharp  right-sided chest pain that is worse on deep inhalation. She reported feeling unwell for the past few days with slight cough and shortness of breath that she attributed to her usual bouts of bronchitis. However  over the past several hours  she noticed that the shortness of breath had worsened and she felt faint. She also mentioned sudden onset of increased heart rate.  Key Points to cover during case discussion:  In this case scenario  the student should recognize the urgency of J.D.'s condition and consider acute pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis due to her recent history of DVT  symptoms of pleuritic chest pain  shortness of breath  and tachycardia.  The training case may also emphasize the importance of a therapeutic relationship with patients concerning medication compliance  as J.D.'s decision to discontinue her anticoagulation medication could be a contributing factor to her current predicament.  This case provides an opportunity for students to discuss the pathophysiology of PE  risk factors  how a DVT can lead to a PE  the importance of patient history  and appropriate diagnostic tests (like a D-dimer test  chest CT angiogram  ultrasound of the legs) and treatment options for acute pulmonary embolism.   It's important to also discuss the differential diagnoses for a patient presenting shortness of breath  chest pain and cough like pneumonia  pneumothorax  lung cancer  asthma  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
9,10,87,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial87,Case Study: Acute Pulmonary Embolism  Patient Information: Name: Ms. Walters  Age: 62 years Sex: Female Ethnicity: African-American  Occupation: Retired School Teacher  Presenting Issue: Ms. Walters presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain that started two hours ago. The pain is sharp  localized on the right side of the chest  and gets worse with deep breaths. She also complains of some unusual leg swelling for the past few days.   Past Medical History: Ms. Walter has a history of atrial fibrillation for which she takes Aspirin. She underwent orthopedic surgery on her left knee six weeks ago and post-surgery  was immobilized for a period of two weeks. She admits to not being very active since the surgery. Her medication list also includes Atorvastatin for dyslipidemia  Metformin for type II diabetes  and Ramipril for hypertension. She does not drink or smoke and has no known drug allergies.  Potential Diagnosis: Considering Ms. Walters' recent orthopedic surgery  immobilisation  current symptoms and medical history  these findings suggest a high probability of an acute pulmonary embolism. However  further diagnostic procedures must be carried out to confirm this diagnosis.  This case can be used to further discuss diagnosing methods such as D-dimer assays  CT pulmonary angiography  and ventilation/perfusion scanning. There should also be discussions about potential treatment options  including anticoagulants and thrombolytic therapy  and the patient's prognosis.  The case also provides an opportunity to discuss risk factors for pulmonary embolism  such as recent surgery  immobilisation  atrial fibrillation  and the use of estrogen-containing medication. It would be crucial to discuss the importance of early detection and treatment of this condition to prevent life-threatening complications such as a stroke or organ damage due to lack of blood flow.
9,10,88,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial88,Case Report:  Patient Information:   A 58-year-old African-American male presented to the emergency department.   Past Medical History:   The patient has known hypertension controlled with medication for the past 7 years. Besides that  the patient had a surgery for a bilateral total hip replacement two months ago. He has been relatively sedentary during his post-operative recovery period. He is a smoker with a 30 pack-year history. The patient's mother had a history of deep vein thrombosis.  Chief Complaints:   The patient describes a sudden onset of sharp  right-sided chest pain that started a few hours ago. He notes that the pain becomes worse with deep breaths. He also reports experiencing episodes of light-headedness and rapid heartbeat. Since yesterday  he has been feeling short of breath even while at rest. No symptoms of a cough  hemoptysis  fever  or sweating were noted. He has not traveled long-distance recently.  Assessment:   Vital signs on presentation demonstrate a blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg  pulse 110 beats/min  respirations 20/min  and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. On physical examination  he appears anxious but is not in acute respiratory distress. There is tachycardia but no murmurs  rubs or gallops on cardiac auscultation. Pulmonary examination reveals tachypnea  but lung auscultation shows clear and equal breath sounds bilaterally with no evidence of consolidation; no leg swelling or calf tenderness noted.  From these  there are multiple risk factors - recent hip surgery and associated reduction in mobility  smoking  and family history of thrombosis. Curtain index of suspicion leans towards an acute pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic procedures should be performed to confirm.   Key Learning Points:   Acute pulmonary embolism can occur in individuals with risk factors such as prolonged immobilization  recent surgeries  smoking  and individuals with family histories of thromboembolic diseases. Symptoms may include sudden-onset chest pain  shortness of breath  tachypnea  and signs of deep vein thrombosis. Management of such patients includes ruling out other conditions like acute myocardial infarction and aortic dissection  confirming the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism through imaging studies  and initiating appropriate treatment strategies.
9,10,89,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial89,Patient Information: A 64-year-old African-American male named Mr. Brown.  Past Medical History: Mr. Brown has a past medical history significant for obesity  hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and a recent total hip arthroplasty performed 10 days ago.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Brown came in to the ER complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath that started approximately 2 hours ago. He describes the dyspnea as being progressive and now feels that he can't catch his breath  even at rest. Furthermore  he voices that he started feeling a sharp pain on the left side of his chest that is worsening when he takes deep breaths. He denies any cough  fever  or palpitations.  Other Relevant Information: Mr. Brown stopped his blood-thinning medicine three days ago due to some minor post-surgery bleeding. He has been less mobile since the operation  largely confined to bed. He denies cigarette smoking or any drug use but admits to moderate alcohol intake. He has a family history of deep vein thrombosis with his father.  Objective Data: On examination  he is anxious and mildly diaphoretic. He has tachycardia and tachypnea. His blood pressure is normal but his oxygen saturation is on the lower side of normal on room air.   Further evaluation and workup needs to be done as his patient profile suggests possible acute pulmonary embolism. A high index of suspicion for acute pulmonary embolism is important in this case due to the patient's recent surgery and immobility  coupled with his sudden onset of breathlessness and chest pain.   Training objectives:  1. Understand the risk factors  pathophysiology  presentations  and complications of acute pulmonary embolism. 2. Understand how to differentiate pulmonary embolism from other causes of chest pain and shortness of breath.  3. Obtain skills in performing an appropriate history  examination  and diagnostic workup for a patient with suspected pulmonary embolism. 4. Develop a management plan for a patient with pulmonary embolism  including immediate stabilization and long-term management.  5. Help students understand the importance of preventive measures such as pre and post-surgical prophylaxis.
9,10,90,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial90,Patient Information:   - Age: 56 years  - Gender: Female  - Occupation: Librarian  - Ethnicity: Caucasian   Past Medical History:   - Patient has been in overall good health.  - Personal history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a knee replacement surgery five years ago.  - Current medication includes daily aspirin.  - Ex-smoker  quit 15 years ago - Family history of heart disease and stroke.  Presenting Complaints:  - Patient arrived at the emergency department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath which started approximately an hour ago. - Patient rated her pain as 8/10 on the pain scale. - No known triggering factor was identified.  - She also noted the sudden onset of chest pain  describing it as sharp and intensifying with deep breaths. - Review of symptoms also revealed mild dizziness and a sense of fatigue for the last two days. - No signs of fever or cough.   Physical Examination:  - Vital signs showed tachypnea (respiratory rate around 22 breaths/min) and tachycardia (heart rate around 110 bpm).  - Oxygen saturation was observed to be 92% on room air.  - No abnormalities were noted in the lung and cardiac auscultation.   This concise case sets the stage for a differential diagnosis that should include acute pulmonary embolism (PE)  based on the patient's risk factors (post-surgery history of DVT)  age  and symptoms  but also considering other potential diagnoses such as acute coronary syndrome  pneumothorax  pneumonia or even a panic attack. Appropriate lab tests  imaging  and management should follow this initial clinical approach. Students should utilize a decision-making model such as Well's criteria for PE  or the Pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC)  to guide their actions.

Additional Comments: The context provided here allows students to apply their understanding of risk factors  presentation  and management for suspected acute pulmonary embolism. The insights that can be gained from this case are significant  particularly in understanding how underlying medical conditions and recent surgical history contribute to the prevalence of a life-threatening condition such as pulmonary embolism.
9,10,95,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial95,Patient Profile:  Name: Jane Doe Age: 68 Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Teacher   Medical History: Ms. Doe has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and had right total knee arthroplasty surgery 10 days ago. She has no known drug allergies and takes Losartan and Atorvastatin daily.   Presenting Complaints:  Ms. Doe presents with sudden onset chest pain  shortness of breath  and palpitations that began earlier today. The chest pain is pleuritic  sharp in nature and increases when taking deep breaths. She has noticed a mild cough but denies hemoptysis  fever  or recent illness.  She reports an overall feeling of anxiety  light-headedness and restlessness. She also reports difficulty in getting around after her recent surgery due to leg pain and limited mobility.  Physical Analysis: On physical examination  Ms. Doe appears anxious. Vital signs demonstrate tachypnea (RR: 24/min) and tachycardia (HR: 110 bpm). Oxygen saturation was found to be 92% on room air. She has a regular rhythm without murmur on heart auscultation. Lungs have decreased breath sounds in the lower right quadrant without crackles or wheezes. Lower extremities show slight swelling of the right calf that is tender to touch  with no discoloration or warmth.  These symptoms are consistent with a suspected acute pulmonary embolism  possibly a post-operative complication. For confirmation and further investigation  a D-dimer test and imaging such as a CT pulmonary angiography should be considered.  Educational Objectives: 1. Recognize the signs and symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism. 2. Understand the importance of taking a thorough history  focusing on recent surgeries  immobilization  or other risk factors for venous thromboembolism. 3. Identify the key diagnostic tests needed to confirm a suspected diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.  4. Understand the importance of starting immediate anticoagulation therapy when acute pulmonary embolism is suspected. 5. Identify the importance of measures to prevent pulmonary embolism post-surgery.  6. Understand the potential complications and mortality associated with acute pulmonary embolism if not diagnosed and treated promptly.

Past Medical History: Patient has a known history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. She is a former smoker who quit 20 years ago and has no known drug allergies. She underwent a total knee replacement surgery 3 weeks ago and has been relatively immobile post-op.  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Smith was brought to the Emergency Department by her family after experiencing sudden onset of severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and cough. She also reported feeling dizzy and sweaty and had fainting spells.   The patient mentioned that she had been having occasional pain and swelling in her right calf over the past week  but she did not seek medical attention as it was minor and she thought it was due to her recent surgery.  Family History: The patient's father had died following a massive heart attack in his early sixties and her mother had a stroke in her late sixties.  Observations: Initial physical examination showed tachycardia and ECG revealed right ventricular strain suggesting pulmonary hypertension. She also had decreased breath sounds on the right side. The swelling observed in her right calf was tender and warm to touch. She was hypoxic with oxygen saturation of 86% on room air.   Clinical Decision: Given her clinical presentation and risk factors (recent surgery  immobility  obesity  and family history)  a working diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism was considered. 
9,10,98,diagnosis9-prompt10-trial98,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired college professor  currently living alone  is a former smoker with a 20-year pack history.
