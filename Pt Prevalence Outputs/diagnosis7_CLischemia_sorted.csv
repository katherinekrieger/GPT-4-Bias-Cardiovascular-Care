7,1,1,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial1,Title: Presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia Patient   Good day  colleagues. I wish to present the case of a 69 year old female patient  Mrs. Sarah Thompson.   Mrs. Thompson is a resident of Brooklyn  New York. She has been known to have a longstanding history of uncontrolled type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for over 25 years. This has been complicated with Diabetic Neuropathy and Retinopathy. Furthermore  she has a history of smoking approximately a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. She also suffers from Hyperlipidemia and Hypertension  which were discovered a decade ago along with moderate renal insufficiency. She reportedly has been taking medication for these conditions but adherence has been sporadic.  Recently  she presented in our clinic with complaints of progressive severe rest pain in her right leg over the past few weeks that worsens at night and even causes her to lose sleep. Her pain substantially intensifies when her leg is elevated  especially in bed  and relieves somewhat when she dangles her leg over the bed. She also reports non-healing sores on her foot and thickened and discolored toenails.  Physical examination showed weakened pulses in the right leg  cold skin  and substantial loss of hair on the limb. The foot was mildly swollen and there was notable discoloration of the toes consistent with cyanosis. Foot ulcerations with gangrene were evident. Neurological examination revealed significant loss of sensation in her foot.  The combination of her clinical history  symptoms and physical examination findings  points out to a severe peripheral artery disease  particularly Critical Limic Ischemia (CLI). However  she will require further diagnostic assessments including Ankle-brachial index and Imaging tests for confirmation and appropriate treatment planning. Early revascularization is her best chance for limb salvage.  In conclusion  Mrs. Thompson's condition is a result of the interplay of multiple risk factors comprising of Diabetes Mellitus  Smoking  Hypertension  Hyperlipidemia  and moderate renal insufficiency. This case underscores the significance of managing these key modifiable risk factors for CLI  for preventing disease progression and associated complications.
7,1,2,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial2,Patient Presentation: We have a 68-year-old African American male patient  Mr. John Smith  presenting with critical limb ischemia involving his right lower extremity. Mr. Smith reports experiencing a dramatic increase in rest pain over the past few weeks  particularly at night  paired with non-healing ulcerations on his right foot.   Medical History:  Mr. Smith has an extensive medical history  notably characterized by Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which he has been managing successfully with oral antidiabetic medication for the past 15 years. He also has been treated for Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia for the past 10 years. His medication regimen includes metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin. In addition  Mr. Smith has a significant 30-pack-year smoking history  but he quit smoking approximately five years ago.   Prior relevant investigations included a lower limb arterial Doppler ultrasound conducted 8 months ago  the findings of which suggested moderate peripheral artery disease. The patient is not known to have any allergies  and there is a family history of cardiovascular diseases  particularly myocardial infarctions in his father and older brother.   Given the nature and severity of Mr. Smith’s symptoms  coupled with his past medical history  a clinical diagnosis of critical limb ischemia appears warranted  warranting further evaluation  confirmation through diagnostic tests  and formulation of a suitable treatment plan.
7,1,3,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial3,Title: Clinical Case Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Introduction: We present the case of a 75 -year old Caucasian male patient  Mr. A  who arrived at the emergency department complaining of lower extremity pain that significantly impedes his daily functioning  particularly during exercise and sometimes at rest.   Demographics & Lifestyle: Mr. A was born and currently resides in the urban area of New York City. He is a retired engineer  a long-time widower living alone who occasionally receives home assistance. He admits to a 50-year history of smoking a little over 1 pack of cigarettes per day.  Past Medical History: Mr. A suffers from long-standing chronic conditions that are relevant to his current condition:  1. Cardiovascular Health: Mr. A has a 10-year history of hypertension. His blood pressure has oftentimes poorly controlled with medication regimen – Lisinopril 20mg daily and Atenolol 50mg daily. In 2015  he also suffered from an acute myocardial infarction requiring angioplasty and stent placement.  2. Diabetes status: He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus approximately 15 years ago. It is managed with Metformin 1000mg twice daily  yet his HbA1c levels remain consistently high at around 8.5%.  3. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): With a 5-year history of PAD  he initially reported intermittent claudication which has recently worsened.  4. Lipid profile: He shows dyslipidemia with an LDL of 140 mg/dL  HDL 35 mg/dL  Triglycerides 220mg/dL. He has been taking a maximum dose statin (Atorvastatin 80mg) daily.  Conclusion: All these circumstances  combined with the patient's age  chronic tobacco usage and lack of exercise  have led up to his present situation. Upon examination  his right lower extremity showed signs of pallor  significant hair loss  absent distal pulses  and dependent rubor which is indicative of critical limb ischemia. Pain onset at rest signifies that his condition is in an advanced stage. With these considerations in mind  multidisciplinary team coordination is crucial for this patient’s clinical management plan. 
7,1,4,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial4,Title: Patient Presentation with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: Mr. John Doe is a 68-year-old African-American male  retired school teacher  who resides in Calgary. He has been a chronic smoker for over 40 years and also frequently consumes alcohol. He has been a patient at our medical facility for 15 years.  Presenting Concern: Mr. Doe presents with a 6-month history of progressive pain in the right lower limb  particularly in the calf region. He reports the pain intensifies while walking and relieves during rest (Intermittent Claudication). Lately  he has been experiencing rest pain especially at night  along with numbness and a cold sensation in the same limb.  Physical Examination: Mr. Doe appears to be in apparent distress due to pain. Examination results reveal weak or absent pulses in the right lower limb  pallor on elevation  and dependent rubor. There is also evidence of non-healing ulcers located on the right foot's digits and heel area. The right lower limb skin appears shiny and hair growth seems minimal compared to the left leg.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia which are being managed with medication. On both counts  compliance to the medication has been suboptimal. He was also diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago  for which he is on a regulated diet and oral hypoglycemic agents.  Family History: There is a family history of cardiac disease. His father passed away from a myocardial infarction at 67 and his older brother underwent angioplasty at the age of 62.  Considering his age  lifestyle  and clinical presentation  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia secondary to peripheral artery disease (PAD) is highly likely. He is immediately referred for further vascular imaging and angiography to confirm the diagnosis and plan possible revascularization. 
7,1,5,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial5,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information:  Mr. John Stevens  a 72-year-old African-American male  presents with rest pain and skin ulcers on his right lower limb  which have significantly worsened in the last few weeks.   Demographics: Mr. Stevens is a retired construction worker and has been living with his wife in suburban America after retirement. He is a former smoker with a history of two packs a day for 20 years  but has abstained from smoking for the past 5 years. He drinks alcohol occasionally. Mr. Stevens is moderately obese with a BMI of 33 and leads a sedentary life. He is insured and is financially independent.  Medical History: Mr. Stevens has a history of several chronic issues due to his previous lifestyle choice. This includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both under reasonable control with medications. He has also been treated for hyperlipidemia with statins. He hasn't had any hospitalizations in the last 10 years except for a gall bladder removal surgery about eight years prior  but none for any cardiovascular disease. There is a family history of peripheral artery disease in his father who died of a sudden heart attack at the age of 79.   Presenting Condition: Mr. Stevens has been complaining of severe pain in his right foot  especially at night. He noticed ulcers  which have been persistent for six weeks despite conservative local wound care. Upon examination  the patient exhibited known lower extremity signs of critical limb ischemia like cold foot  shiny leg skin  hair loss  and non-healing ulcers on the foot mainly on his toes. His pulse in the right lower leg and foot was markedly diminished compared to the contralateral limb.  In summary  Mr. Stevens presents critical limb ischemia  likely resultant of his uncontrolled diabetic and hyperlipidemic condition combined with a history of heavy smoking. Immediate attention is required to prevent worsening of condition and possible loss of his limb.
7,1,6,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial6,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Female with Diabetes  Demographic Information: Patient Profile: Mrs. L  a 73-year-old Caucasian female patient hailing from California is currently presenting symptoms of critical limb ischemia (CLI).   Lifestyle: She leads a sedentary lifestyle and has a past history of smoking for over 40 years. She is retired and lives with her husband.   Past Medical History: Her past medical history includes type 2 diabetes for 30 years with suboptimal glycemic control. She also has hypertension which has been managed with medication. Three years ago  she was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and has been undergoing treatment since then. A review of her family history revealed that her father had atherosclerosis and her mother suffered from heart disease. She has no known allergies.   Presenting Symptoms: Mrs. L came to the hospital with complaints of severe pain in the lower limbs  especially during physical activity  which she described as 'claudication.' On some occasions  she experienced pain at rest as well. She reported chronic non-healing wounds on her right foot and her foot had noticeable discoloration. She also mentioned feelings of coldness in the lower limbs and loss of hair in the affected areas.   These symptoms have been gradually intensifying over the last six months  impacting her quality of life  and restricting her to home due to reduced mobility.
7,1,7,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial7,Presentation of Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Demographics: Patient Name: John Doe Age: 68  Gender: Male Occupation: Retired Engineer Residence: Boston  Massachusetts Ethnicity: Caucasian  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has been dealing with significant health issues over the past years. He has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 20 years ago which has been poorly controlled. The patient had myocardial infarction 10 years ago and was diagnosed with Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease  followed by hypertension managed with oral medications. Upon follow-ups  he has disclosed that he is a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history but has been tobacco-free for 15 years now. Additionally  Chronic Kidney Disease – Stage 3 has been an alarming concern contributing to his deteriorating health.  Presenting Complaint: For the past 2 months  the patient has been experiencing severe pain in his right lower limb  especially while walking a short distance which he has been attributing to his advancing age. However  in the past couple of weeks  he noticed persistent pain  even at rest  particularly at night. This was accompanied by changes in skin color  slowed hair growth  and a noticeable decrease in temperature of the leg compared to the other limb.  Diagnosis: Upon physical examination  a significantly weak pulse was detected in his right leg. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test was conducted immediately suggesting severe peripheral artery disease. Further investigations with duplex ultrasonography indicated severe stenosis of the femoral artery. Based on these findings and clinical presentation  the diagnosis was consistent with Critical Limb Ischemia.  Management Plan:  The patient was immediately referred to a vascular specialist. An Angiogram was recommended to determine the blood flow needs and angioplasty or bypass surgery are the procedural options depending on angiogram results. Further  close involvement of a Diabetes Specialist and Nephrologist is prudent to manage his comorbid conditions. Patient education regarding lifestyle modifications including a balanced diet  regular physical activity  strict glycemic control and routine monitoring was emphasized.    Prognosis: As the patient is presenting with severe symptoms at advanced stages of the disease  his prognosis will depend on the promptness of the treatment  comprehensive management of his comorbid conditions  and adherence to the prescribed treatment plan. It is crucial to closely monitor for any signs of infection or non-healing ulcers which may lead to possible amputation if left unattended.
7,1,8,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial8,Title: A Case Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Background: Mr. James Arthur  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presented with symptoms consistent with critical limb ischemia (CLI). He is retired and resides in the suburbs with his wife. Mr. Arthur has a history of occasional smoking and moderate alcohol consumption.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Arthur had been experiencing severe pain at rest  non-healing ulcers  and tissue necrosis in his right lower leg for several weeks. He reported a significant loss of hair in that area  coldness  and color changes. He also mentioned significant weight loss  loss of appetite  and bouts of insomnia due to sharp  shooting pain  especially during the night.   Medical History: Mr. Arthur has a known history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus (for over 20 years)  coronary heart disease  and had a stroke at the age of 65. He has a history of smoking 10-15 cigarettes a day for the past 50 years. He is on multiple anti-hypertensive medications  oral hypoglycemic agents  and statins. He has been somewhat non-compliant with his medication regimen  especially for his diabetes.  Family History: Mr. Arthur comes from a family with a significant history of heart disease. His father died at 68 due to a myocardial infarction  and his older brother was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) in his early 50s.  Physical Examination: Our examination revealed pallor  weak pulse  and decreased sensation in the right lower leg. The right leg also had multiple sores that were not healing. ABI (Ankle-Brachial Index) was found to be significantly below the normal range in the right leg  further confirming PAD.  Overview: This presentation of Mr. Arthur exemplifies a typical critical limb ischemia case  a severe form of peripheral artery disease  characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers or gangrenes in the affected limb. His history of cardiovascular ailments  diabetes  and long-term smoking habit increases his risk for developing advanced peripheral artery disease resulting in critical limb ischemia. Early diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach to management  including risk factor modification  revascularization  and wound care  are needed to prevent limb loss and improve overall prognosis. 
7,1,9,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial9,Patient Presentation:   The patient in question is Mr. John Doe  a 75-year-old gentleman  residing at 123 Main St  New York  NY. He is Russian American and primarily speaks English at home. He is a retired construction worker and has been independent in his activities of daily living until his recent physiological changes.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a significant history of cardiovascular diseases. He has been dealing with chronic hypertension for over 20 years and diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 10 years ago. Mr. Doe's diabetic condition is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents  while his hypertensive status is controlled with a calcium channel blocker. He also has a five-year history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) but has been noncompliant with the prescribed medication regimen and lifestyle modifications. His other medical issues include hyperlipidemia and a previous episode of cerebral infarction without residual deficits. He was a heavy smoker but quit about five years ago.  Presenting Conditions:  Mr. Doe presents with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). His typical symptoms consist of severe pain in his feet  especially at night; wounds on his feet and toes that are not healing; and a noticeable decrease in the temperature of his lower leg. Notably  he reports that he was initially having claudicating pain  which has progressively worsened over time  and now the pain is consistent even while at rest. He also observes that the color of his right foot has gradually changed to pale and shiny. The symptoms have severely affected his quality of life  with limitations in normal activities.   Given his extensive history of cardiovascular disease and non-compliance with PAD treatment  his current presentation with CLI is not out of character. Referral to a vascular specialist is immediately required to prevent further complications  including potential loss of the limb. 
7,1,10,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial10,Patient Presentation: Ladies and Gentlemen  I would like you to meet Mr. John Bennett  a 65-year-old Caucasian male from the urban areas of San Francisco  presenting with symptoms of critical limb ischemia (CLI).   Medical History: Mr. Bennett  a retired policeman  has an extensive past medical history which includes type 2 diabetes  which he has had for 25 years. This condition  unfortunately  is poorly controlled  as evidenced by his latest HbA1c of 8.5%.  Furthermore  he has a known history of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  diagnosed 10 years ago  for which he has been on Aspirin and Atorvastatin. Despite management  he has had two previous hospital admissions in the past 5 years due to exacerbations of PAD. Moreover  he has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both controlled with medications. He also has a 40 pack-year smoking history  but successfully quit smoking five years ago.   Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Bennett presents with increasing pain in his left leg  specifically in his calf and foot. The pain is severe and persistent  awakening him from sleep  and not relieved by rest. He also complains of non-healing wounds on the foot. In addition to these symptoms  he reports intermittent claudication and symptoms of rest pain occurring over the past three weeks. On physical examination  the left leg appears pale and cool to touch. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is suggestive of severe ischemia.   In summary  the overall clinical scenario of Mr. Bennett is suggestive of critical limb ischemia secondary to long-standing diabetes and peripheral artery disease. Given his symptoms  a comprehensive evaluation and timely intervention will be warranted to alleviate symptoms and prevent adverse outcomes such as limb loss.
7,1,11,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial11,Patient Presentation:   Good morning  we are presenting Mr. Robert Turner  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  resident of Pittsburgh  PA. He's a retired mechanic  not involved in any strenuous physical activity post retirement  but used to be a moderate smoker until he quit 10 years ago.  The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe rest pain in his right lower limb  especially while sleeping or at rest. He also reported ulcers and sores which are slow to heal on his lower right leg and foot. The patient also mentioned an increased progressive difficulty in walking distances that he could previously manage comfortably  and has noticed that his right foot feels colder compared to the left.  The pain and coldness intensified drastically in the last 24 hours  prompting the patient to seek medical help. A quick physical examination revealed that pulses were absent below his right knee  his foot was pale and cool to touch  and the pain worsened upon elevating the limb. He was also found to have a gangrenous toe.  Mr. Turner’s past medical history includes a diagnosis of Type II Diabetes Mellitus 15 years ago and Hypertension 5 years ago  both are being managed with oral medications. Cardiac history features an MI treated with angioplasty 8 years ago. He underwent screening colonoscopy 4 years ago which was unremarkable.  In conclusion  Mr. Turner’s age  prior medical history with smoking  DM  Hypertension  and MI  his symptoms of rest pain  non-healing wounds  and the absence of foot pulses point towards a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. His rapid deterioration over the past 24 hours marks an alarming sign  which requires immediate intervention.  Upon diagnosis  Mr. Turner would need intensive management  possibly including medications  revascularization procedures  or amputation depending on the severity of ischemia and his overall health condition. His case emphasizes the necessity of early detection and aggressive management of peripheral arterial diseases  especially in patients with multiple risk factors like Mr. Turner.
7,1,12,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial12,Patient Presentation:  Good Morning/Afternoon   Today I would like to present a case of a 68-year-old Caucasian male who is suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Mr. John Doe is a retired teacher  living in the semi-rural area of Newton  Iowa. He has a significant past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years  and peripheral arterial disease diagnosed 3 years ago. Despite consistent interventional measures  Mr. Doe's lower limb condition has progressively worsened.   The patient is a former smoker  who quit 5 years ago but smoked for 30+ years  consuming 1 pack a day. He is also diagnosed with hypertension  and he's been under medication for the past 10 years. He does not consume alcohol or use illicit drugs. In terms of the family history  his father had myocardial infarction at the age of 72 and his mother was a diabetic patient. The patient's BMI is 30 indicative of obesity.  Mr. Doe presents with non-healing wounds on his right foot  which have been present for the last two months despite regular wound care. He also reports rest pain  particularly at night  which has been disturbing his sleep.   Upon physical examination  there were no palpable pulses in the right leg and foot. The skin is cool to touch and atrophic with some areas of discoloration. His ABI (Ankle-Brachial Index) was less than 0.3  and Doppler ultrasound revealed multiple stenotic lesions in lower leg arteries.  Thank you.
7,1,13,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial13,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a Middle-Aged Diabetic Female  Patient Information:   Ms. Linda Smith  a 54-year-old African-American female  presents with a 2-week history of progressive onset of severe pain in her left lower extremity. The pain  which is more severe during rest and at night  is compounded by intractable wounds and ulcerations on her lower limb and foot. Ms. Smith resides with her family in New York and works as a high school teacher.  Relevant Past Medical History:   Ms. Smith has a ten-year history of non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus which is poorly controlled  evidenced by her recent Hemoglobin A1C result (HbA1C) of 9.2%. She also has a five-year history of hypertension  for which she is being treated with a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor. However  she reports irregularity in taking her antihypertensive.  Other relevant medical history includes obesity  with a body mass index (BMI) of 32 kg/m2 and hyperlipidemia  managed with statins. She quit smoking 8 years ago but had a history of 15 pack-year tobacco use.  Family history reveals both parents had diabetes  her father had hypertension and her mother had a heart attack in her 60s.  Clinical Presentation:  On physical examination  her left lower limb appears pale and cool to touch with a diminished pulse. There are dark discolored patches indicative of ulcerations  and few necrotic tissues are also visible in between her toes. Her BMI remains elevated at 32 kg/m2. The blood pressure in her left ankle is also significantly lower compared to her arms  indicating the possibility of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  In summary  this is a case of a middle-aged diabetic female presenting with uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  obesity  and hyperlipidemia. The current symptomatology indicates critical limb ischemia  a severe stage of PAD most likely due to poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension. Immediate intervention and management are required to avert limb amputation or other equally severe consequences.
7,1,14,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial14,Patient Presentation:  We are presenting a 68-year-old African-American male patient  Mr. John Thomas  who has been diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Residing in Chicago  Illinois  Mr. Thomas is a retired high school teacher who is widowed and living with his adult daughter. He has a history of smoking for 30 years  although he quit approximately a year ago. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both of which are medically managed yet poorly controlled.  Mr. Thomas has been experiencing progressively worsening rest pain in his right leg for the past six months. Over the last two weeks  he also noticed the appearance of non-healing ulcers on his right foot. Physical examination confirmed the presence of atrophic skin changes  absent distal pulses  cold skin  and numerous ulcers over the right foot.  Clinical investigations have shown increased fasting blood glucose and lipid levels. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed  indicating an index of 0.40 for the right leg and 0.95 for the left leg  suggesting significant peripheral arterial disease in the right leg. Duplex ultrasound  performed to further characterize the vascular status  demonstrated complete occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery and further ischemic changes consistent with critical limb ischemia.  This case underscores the need for urgent revascularization procedures for Mr. Thomas to prevent the progression to limb loss. He has been referred to a vascular surgeon and will require meticulous blood glucose and blood pressure management  along with a strict wound care regimen. His case emphasizes the significance of early detection and intervention in patients with risk factors for peripheral artery disease to avoid the debilitating consequences of critical limb ischemia.
7,1,15,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial15,Presentation Topic: Critical Limb Ischemia Patient Case Study  Meet Mr. Richard Martinez  a 72-year-old Hispanic male from San Diego  California  presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Mr. Martinez is a retired construction worker and currently lives with his wife. He has a daughter and two grandchildren living nearby. Mr. Martinez maintains a fairly active lifestyle despite his age and enjoys walking his dog every morning around the neighborhood. He has had no known allergies and is a non-smoker.  Mr. Martinez has had a long-standing history of controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  leading to peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  diagnosed five years ago. He was managed with statins  antiplatelets  and antihypertensive medications. He also has early-stage chronic kidney disease that was identified during initial screening for hypertension workup. He does not have diabetes  heart disease  or any malignancies.  Concerning his CLI  he began experiencing classic symptoms about 6 months ago  primarily persistent leg pain  especially at rest. The pain is predominantly in his right calf and foot  and has recently become so severe that it is disrupting his sleep. He also felt coldness in his right foot  often accompanied by pale or bluish discoloration. His daughter and wife became concerned when they noticed a non-healing ulcer on his right foot's lateral aspect - a development which brought him to medical attention. Doing house chores and walking his dog  which he used to enjoy  have become increasingly challenging for him due to his pain and immobility.   These symptoms point towards critical limb ischemia  which is a severe stage of peripheral arterial disease. His physical examination and diagnostic tests like Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) and Doppler ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis.   Critical limb ischemia  like in Mr. Martinez's case  is a significant risk factor for lower extremity amputation unless it's properly treated. The management strategy would primarily aim to re-establish blood flow through revascularization therapies such as angioplasty  bypass surgery  or endarterectomy along with efficient wound care.   Mr. Martinez's case emphasizes the importance of recognizing and treating critical limb ischemia promptly to prevent serious complications like limb loss and to improve the quality of life.  
7,1,16,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial16,Patient Presentation: We have an 80-year-old female patient  Mrs. M.J  who is diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). She lives in an assisted living facility in Somerset  New Jersey and is a retired school teacher.   Medical History: Mrs. M.J has a long-standing diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  first diagnosed at the age of 55. She also has Hypertension and Hypercholesterolemia  both of which have been managed with medication for the past 10 years. Moreover  she has a history of smoking for around 40 years  although she quit 10 years ago. There is a record of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The PAD has been managed conservatively for several years  but despite the management  she has progressively worsening symptoms.  Current Symptoms: Recently  she was admitted to the hospital due to severe rest pain in the right lower foot for the past week. The pain increases at night and tends to decrease with hanging her limb over the side of the bed. She has also observed non-healing ulcers on the big toe of her right foot. There is no report of fever  but she mentioned an unintentional weight loss in the last month. No allergies are reported.   Physical Examination: Vitals revealed a blood pressure of 145/80 mmHg  a resting heart rate of 80 bpm  and a BMI of 29. Significant findings on examination include pallor  diminished pulses below the right knee  coldness of the right foot  a decubitus ulcer with necrotic tissue on the right big toe  and decreased sensation below the right ankle.   Based on the above data  CLI is a serious condition that needs urgent attention in order to salvage the limb and ensure patient survival. An urgent vascular consultation has been sought for Mrs. M.J to determine the best plan of action.
7,1,17,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial17,Patient Presentation:  Patient's Name: [Confidential] Gender: Female Age: 78 years  Race: Caucasian  Residential Status: Lives independently  Occupation: Retired Teacher  Chief Complaint: Increasing pain in the left foot  especially when at rest.  Present Illness: Patient has been experiencing progressive pain in her left foot for last 5 months  which has now escalated to severe. The pain is mostly felt at night or while resting. She has also noticed intermittent claudication and discoloration  with the extremity being colder than the rest of her body. There is a non-healing ulcer on her left heel.  Past Medical History: Patient was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago  which is managed with Metformin. She also has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia and has been smoking for 30 years approximately  only recently quitting 3 years past. She underwent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) 5 years ago for ischemic heart disease.  Family History: The patient’s father had peripheral artery disease (PAD) and her mother had Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.   Allergies: The patient is allergic to Penicillin  causing rash and shortness of breath.  Medications: She takes Metformin for her diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  Atorvastatin for high cholesterol levels  and Aspirin for prophylaxis against heart disease.  Physical Examination: Lower limb examination shows pallor  absent pulses and a chronic non-healing ulcer on the heel of the left foot.   Given the above clinical findings  history of diabetes  coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia  plus the smoking history  we are considering a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia. Further diagnostic procedures including Angiography will be carried out to confirm this diagnosis.
7,1,18,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial18,Patient Presentation:  We present the case of Mr. James Lopez  a 68-year-old male patient of Hispanic ethnicity  residing at 132 Central Park  New York City. He is a retired high school teacher and has a history of smoking for about 10 years from the age of 30 to 40  but quit 28 years ago.  Mr. Lopez is presenting with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  characterized by the onset of severe pain in his right lower limb  particularly his lower leg and foot. His pain is exacerbated by physical activity and gets marginally better during rest periods  accompanied by numbness  muscle weakness  and a noticeable loss of hair on the affected leg. Furthermore  Mr. Lopez also reported intermittent claudication  the onset of pain with exertion and relief with rest.  His relevant past medical history includes Type II Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed 10 years ago  and controlled with insulin injections coupled with dietary modifications. He also has a history of hypertension for which he's taking Lisinopril. Mr. Lopez had a Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) 5 years ago following myocardial infarction. He has been adherent to medications and regularly attended his cardiac rehabilitation. He has no known allergies to medication or food and no family history of limb ischemia.   This complex interplay of his past medical history  primarily his longstanding diabetic status  previous myocardial infarction  and history of smoking  has increased his susceptibility to develop peripheral arterial diseases  potentially leading to his currently presenting severe form  Critical Limb Ischemia  that needs immediate medical attention.  This is an urgent case requiring the initiation of limb salvage investigations with the possibility of revascularization interventions and aggressive control of risk factors to prevent the disease's further progression. Due to his medical history  we must consider the increased risk of surgery  coordinating multidisciplinary care involving cardiology and vascular surgery teams.   The main goals of his treatment would be pain relief  wound healing on his right lower limb  prevention of limb amputation  improving his quality of life  and treating modifiable risks. 
7,1,19,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial19,Patient Presentation:  We are here to discuss the case of Mr. Thomas Peterson  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  who resides in Austin  Texas. He has been suffering from intermittent claudication and leg pain that has recently modified into sustained pain even at rest  concerning for critical limb ischemia.  Mr. Peterson has a significant past medical history including type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past fifteen years  both currently being managed with medication. He has also undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) around five years ago for symptomatic coronary artery disease. Additionally  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) approximately two years ago  which adds to his risk of developing critical limb ischemia.  Furthermore  he admits to a 40-year history of smoking  consuming approximately one pack of cigarettes per day. He has attempted to quit smoking numerous times  but has been unsuccessful thus far. Mr. Peterson does not have any history of alcohol or substance abuse.  His family history reveals occurrences of cardiovascular diseases  with his father succumbing to a myocardial infarction at age 78 and his older brother having been diagnosed with PAD.  In summary  this patient’s longstanding history of smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  and hypertension alongside with diagnosed peripheral artery disease  pose a high risk for the development of critical limb ischemia. Immediate assessment and management of his current symptoms are of utmost importance to prevent limb loss and enhance his long-term quality of life. 
7,1,20,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial20,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year-old African American male named Mr. Jerrod Thompson  who has resided in Franklin  Tennessee for the past three decades. He worked in construction until five years ago when he retired. The patient is a widow with three adult children and three grandchildren. He currently lives alone and is able to drive and maintain routine daily activities independently.  Presenting concern: Mr. Thompson presents to the clinic with complaints of severe  recurrent foot pain  particularly in his left foot. He reports that the pain is worse at night and that often hanging his foot over the side of the bed seems to alleviate the symptoms. In addition  a non-healing wound has been noticed on the big toe of the same foot for the past few weeks.  Past medical history: Mr. Thompson has a significant past medical history  including type II diabetes mellitus since the age of 45 which is controlled with Metformin  peripheral artery disease diagnosed 3 years ago  and hypertension for the past 15 years controlled by Lisinopril/Hydrochlorothiazide. Furthermore  he is a former smoker  who quit 7 years ago  having previously smoked one pack per day for almost 35 years.  Clinical findings: On physical examination  the patient's left lower limb had significantly reduced pulsations. The skin of the left foot appeared pale with signs of atrophy and the mentioned non-healing ulcer on his big toe. No edema was noted. His ankle-brachial index was less than 0.4. Doppler ultrasound further confirmed a significant decrease in vascular perfusion to the left lower limb.  Case Conclusion: Considering the patient's clinical symptoms  physical findings  and past medical history  particularly of diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) is suggested. This is a severe blockage in the arteries of the lower extremities  which markedly reduces blood-flow leading to pain  skin ulcers or gangrenous tissue. This is a serious condition and warrants immediate attention and intervention.  Next Steps: The patient's condition renders him at risk of amputation if left untreated. As a result  he has been referred to a vascular surgeon for further management which might include revascularization via angioplasty or bypass surgery. In addition  the patient is recommended to have tight glycemic control to prevent progression of vascular disease.
7,1,21,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial21,Patient Presentation:  We are looking at the case of Mr. Richard Davidson  a 75-year-old Caucasian male who was referred to the vascular lab with symptoms consistent with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Mr. Davidson is a retired construction engineer and veteran who lives with his wife in Flagstaff  Arizona. He has presented with rest pain  numbness  and color change in his left lower limb that has progressively worsened over the last 2 months to the point where he is incapable of walking without intense discomfort.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Davidson has a significant history of cardiovascular diseases  with a prior Myocardial Infarction about ten years ago. He is hypertensive and has Type II Diabetes Mellitus which he has been managing for the past 15 years. He has a known history of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) for which he had undergone angioplasty in his right leg 5 years ago. Approximately three years back he was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. He has a 50 pack-year history of smoking  though he quit almost a year ago.  Medications include aspirin  atorvastatin  metformin  and lisinopril.  Family history indicates his father had atherosclerosis and succumbed to a stroke  while his mother had hypertension.  Physical Examination:  On examination  his left lower leg appears discolored  and the foot is cold to touch  suggestive of diminished blood supply. Arterial Doppler could not detect a sufficient pulse in his left foot. There were no signs of infection  ulcer  or gangrene  at the moment.  Overall  due to the significant past medical history including PAD  diabetes mellitus  and smoking in combination with the physical findings  the primary working diagnosis is Critical Limb Ischemia. Urgent angiography and vascular consultation are warranted to manage and mitigate the risk of the potential loss of limb. With aggressive management  it is hoped his prognosis can be improved.
7,1,22,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial22,Patient Presentation  Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Johnson. He is a retired teacher and resides in the city with his wife.  Presenting Problem: Mr. Johnson has presented with symptoms indicative of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He reports to have been experiencing significant and persistent pain in his right lower limb  which has been particularly severe in his calf and foot even during rest. He has also identified slow-healing ulcers on his toes and a noticeable difference in temperature between both legs  with the right leg being cooler.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has been a smoker for the past 40 years recently quit 6 months ago. He has known history of cardiovascular disease  with a previous diagnosis of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) 5 years ago  for which he underwent a bypass surgery in the right lower limb. He is also living with Type 2 diabetes  diagnosed 10 years ago  and has been on oral hypoglycemic agents. He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  managed with medications. No known allergies have been recorded.   Family History: There is a significant family history of cardiovascular disease. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 68.  Overall  Mr. Johnson's presenting symptoms  along with his past and family medical history put forth a strong indication of Critical Limb Ischemia. Further diagnostic evaluations would be required to provide definitive diagnosis. Prompt recognition and treatment is crucial  as CLI can potentially lead to limb loss if not addressed in a timely manner.
7,1,23,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial23,Title: Clinical Presentation of Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Profile  Name: Mr. Henry Jenkins  Age: 72 years old  Sex: Male  Race: African American  Occupation: Retired Electrician  Past Medical History:  Mr. Jenkins has a known history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  for which he is on medication (Metformin). He was diagnosed approximately 10 years ago and his records indicate inconsistent control of glycemic index levels. He also has a history of high blood pressure  for which he takes Lisinopril  and hyperlipidemia  controlled with Atorvastatin. As per his medical records  he was diagnosed with both hypertension and hyperlipidemia 6 years ago. He also has a 40-pack year history of smoking but quit smoking 5 years ago. He has no known allergy to any medications.  Clinical Presentation:  Mr. Jenkins presented to the clinic with progressive pain in his right lower leg  which has worsened considerably over the past week. He described the pain as being severe  constant and unrelieved with rest. He noticed that the pain intensified during mild leg elevation and lessened when he positioned the leg dependently. The pain has also evolved to disturbing his sleep.  On physical exam  his right lower leg appeared paler than the unaffected left leg  there was loss of hair growth  and the leg was cold to the touch. Upon examination  both posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were absent. The presence of non-healing ulcers was noted on the tips of his right toes.  Conclusion:  Given the significant pain at rest  presence of non-healing ulcers and absence of peripheral pulses  the findings are consistent with a preliminary diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI). Mr. Jenkins’ past medical history of diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  along with his past smoking history  make him a high-risk candidate for peripheral artery disease leading to CLI. A vascular surgery consultation has been advised for further evaluation and management of this patient.
7,1,24,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial24,Patient Presentation:  Patient’s Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 68-years-old  Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Electrician  The patient lives with his wife in a suburban setting. He presents with consistent  severe pain in his right leg when at rest. The pain is usually at a level 7 out of 10 and often disturbs his sleep. Patient describes the pain as burning and cramping sensation localized in his calf and foot. Upon physical examination  the foot appears pale and cold  with delayed capillary refill. There are also signs of skin breakdown and minor ulceration on the heel.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a significant past medical history including type 2 diabetes mellitus  which he has had for 25 years and is managed with insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. He has a history of hypertension controlled with medication  hyperlipidemia managed with statins  and a 40-year history of heavy smoking. He has been hospitalized twice for cardiac issues - myocardial infarction 10 years ago and cardiac catheterization indicating a moderate vessel disease 5 years ago. Patient has been non-compliant with smoking cessation advice. No known allergies.  Summary:  Given the patient's reports of pain  observed physical symptoms  and past medical history  clinical suspicion is strongly oriented toward critical limb ischemia. The patient’s longstanding diabetes  smoking history  and cardiovascular disease represent significant risk factors. Moreover  the presence of rest pain and trophic changes such as skin pallor  coolness  delayed capillary refill and ulceration are indicative of advanced chronic limb-threatening ischemia. Immediate vascular consultation  diagnostic angiography and possible revascularization are advised.
7,1,25,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial25,Patient Presentation:  Meet Mr. Thomas Jenkins  a 72-year-old male Caucasian from Albany  New York. Mr. Jenkins presented to the emergency department due to severe pain in his left lower extremity  particularly in his foot. The pain  which he described as sharp and constant  has been disturbing his sleep over the last two weeks. Apart from the pain  he also reported that his left foot is noticeably colder than the right and  recently  he observed an ulcer in his left toe that seems not to be healing despite caring for it at home. The combination of severe pain  difference in temperature between the two limbs  and non-healing ulcer is suggestive of critical limb ischemia.  His past medical history is quite significant. Mr. Jenkins has been a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 15 years  and has had difficulties managing his blood sugar levels despite regular medications. Additionally  he has a history of hypertension  treated with medication for the past 10 years. He also has high cholesterol levels and coronary artery disease  for which he underwent an angioplasty procedure six years ago. Notably  Mr. Jenkins has a 40-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day  although he quit smoking approximately five years ago.  In terms of family history  both of his parents had diabetes and hypertension. His father had a heart attack at the age of 68 and his mother had a stroke at the age of 74.  Mr. Jenkins’ past surgical history includes the aforementioned angioplasty and an appendectomy at 32 years of age. He reported no known allergies.   To sum up  Mr. Jenkins  a 72-year-old male presenting with severe pain  temperature difference between limbs  and a non-healing ulcer in his left lower extremity  has a past medical history significant for diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  coronary artery disease  and a long history of smoking  indicating a high risk for arterial diseases like peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia.
7,1,26,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial26,Patient Presentation:  We are discussing Mr. Patrick Wilson  a 72-year-old African-American male patient from Ohio  who presented to this clinic with symptoms consistent with critical limb ischemia.   Patrick reports exact symptoms of extreme pain in his right leg  particularly below the knee  which tends to intensify while walking or exercising and somewhat subside when he rests. He has even experienced instances of pain while at rest  compelling him to elevate his leg for temporary relief. His foot often feels cold and displays a noticeable change in color to a pale or bluish hue.  Upon review of his past medical records  it’s significant to note Mr. Wilson is a former smoker and quit the habit 15 years ago. He has a long-standing history of uncontrolled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He had undergone a previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for myocardial infarction 10 years ago. Thereafter he had been taking medications religiously  including aspirin and statins.  Moreover  he had a history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs)  and his father suffered from a stroke  indicating a probable genetic disposition to vascular diseases  justifying his high risk of peripheral arterial disease which has now manifested as critical limb ischemia.  He has kept a healthy diet  limiting sodium and sugar intake. Still  his blood sugar levels have been challenging to manage  frequently straying from recommended levels  hampering his condition.  In conclusion  considering his symptoms and his background of various concurrent illnesses  there is an immediate need for rigorous evaluations to prevent the progression of the condition which might lead to limb loss. We will have to aggressively treat his modifiable risk factors  chiefly tight glycemic control and hypertension  along with initiating therapies targeted at revascularization and pain management. We plan for a multidisciplinary approach involving geriatrics  endocrine  cardiology  and vascular surgery to achieve the best possible outcome.
7,1,27,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial27,**Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia**  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Samuel Thompson Age: 67 years Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Engineer Residence: Boston  Massachusetts  Insurance: Medicare   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Thompson presents with severe pain in his right lower leg for the past three weeks. The pain has been unresponsive to over-the-counter pain medications and has now increased in intensity over the past few days  making it difficult for him to sleep at night. Additionally  he has noticed a considerable decrease in physical activity due to the pain  and the skin on his foot has turned a pale color.   Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia dating back 10 years. He has been compliant with medications for these conditions  including amlodipine 5mg once daily for hypertension and atorvastatin 20mg once daily for hyperlipidemia. Additionally  he has a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit smoking about 5 years ago. He doesn’t have any known allergies. He has a past surgical history of a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 7 years ago due to ischemic heart disease.  Family History:  Mr. Thompson's father died at the age of 72 due to a heart attack and his mother of a stroke at 78. His younger sister is living with diabetes mellitus.  Physical Examination:  On examination  his right foot is cold to touch compared to the left. There is a delay in capillary refilling time and there are no palpable pulses in the right posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis. His foot appears pale and distal leg hair is absent. No obvious wounds or ulcers were found.  Given Mr. Thompson’s clinical presentation and his past medical history  he is suspected of having critical limb ischemia  a severe blockage in the arteries of the lower extremities  which markedly reduces blood flow.   Plan:  Order labs including complete blood count  comprehensive metabolic panel  coagulation studies  and a lipid panel. Also  place an order for a lower extremity arterial duplex Ultrasound to assess his vascular health and to confirm the suspected diagnosis. He will likely need consultation with a vascular surgeon for further management. Further medications and treatment will be based on diagnostic results and the severity of his condition. His case should be managed as urgent due to the risk of limb loss. 
7,1,28,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial28,Patient Presentation:  Our patient is Mr. John Doe  a 70-year-old Caucasian male currently living a sedentary lifestyle in the city. He has been a smoker for over 40 years and has a moderate daily intake of alcohol. He is retired and lives with his wife and suffers from critical limb ischemia (CLI). CLI onset in his case was gradual  with the first showing of intermittent leg pain and cramping while walking  which became resting ischemic pain accompanied by the presence of sores and wounds on the toes and feet that are not healing properly.  He presents with a past medical history notable for hyperlipidemia  type II diabetes mellitus  and hypertension  diagnosed approximately 10 years ago and has been managed with oral antidiabetic agents and antihypertensive drugs. Smoker's cough is present. He also had an episode of myocardial infarction about 3 years ago. BMI is 30  indicating obesity.  On physical examination  both lower limbs are cool to touch  with a weak or diminished pulse in the peripheral limbs. There is noticeable skin discoloration  with slow capillary refill and skin atrophy. Chronic ulcers are present on the lower limbs  toes are noted to be necrosed. His lipid panel and HbA1C levels are notably high.  In short  this patient demonstrates both the typical comorbidities and the clinical presentation of critical limb ischemia  likely resulting from long-term atherosclerotic disease driven by his history of smoking  diabetes  obesity  and hyperlipidemia. Further evaluation and management will focus on his overall cardiovascular health  measures to mitigate ischemia  and specific wound care to help prevent amputation.
7,1,29,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial29,Presentation of Patient With Critical Limb Ischemia  Demographics:  Patient Name: Mr. Carlos Gomez Age: 68 Sex: Male Race: Hispanic Occupation: Retired Engineer  Chief Complaint:  The patient presents with persistent rest pain in his right lower extremity and non-healing ulcers on his right foot that have been present for more than 3 weeks. The pain has been progressively getting worse and is disturbing his sleep. He also reports coldness of the foot and lack of sensation.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Gomez was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 15 years ago and has been on medication to control his blood sugar levels. His diabetes has mostly been under control except for a few episodes of hyperglycemia.   He was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago. The patient has been on a regimen of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers to manage his blood pressure.  Mr. Gomez was also diagnosed with high cholesterol levels 8 years ago and has been on statins ever since. He has a past history of myocardial infarction 5 years ago and was managed with angioplasty and stenting.   He has Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) diagnosed around 8 years ago and has been on antiplatelet drugs (aspirin) and statins. He also attempted lifestyle modifications including tobacco cessation and regular exercise.  Mr. Gomez has been a smoker for past 30 years but quit smoking 7 years ago. He occasionally consumes alcohol.  Family History:  His father had diabetes and passed away due to myocardial infarction. His mother also had diabetes and passed away at an old age due to complications related to the disease.  Review of Systems:  Endocrine: Well controlled diabetes  follow up checks indicates no diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy. Cardiovascular: Hypertension managed with drugs  previous history of myocardial infarction  diagnosed with PAD. Respiratory: History of smoking  occasional shortness of breath. Skin: Non-healing ulcers on the right foot and decreased sensation.  In conclusion  the patient’s past medical history of diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Peripheral Arterial Disease with his smoking habit escalating his risk factors  present the characteristic symptoms of Critical Limb Ischemia. The persistent rest pain and non-healing ulcers indicate a severe form of Peripheral Arterial Disease.
7,1,30,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial30,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 64-Year-Old Male Patient   Demographics:   The patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian male named John Doe who resides in an urban setting in New York City. He is a retired something and lives with his wife  two adult children  and three grandchildren. The patient is a smoker with a 40-year history (2 packs/day). Mr. Doe is a heavy drinker with an average of five to six alcoholic beverages per day and has a sedentary lifestyle due to his chronic leg pain.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a past medical history significant for Type-2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 18 years ago  hypertension diagnosed 16 years ago  and dyslipidemia diagnosed 12 years ago. His diabetes has been poorly controlled  with recent HbA1c records varying between 8.5-9.0. He was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) 5 years ago and has been experiencing worsening symptoms ever since. A pertinent part of his history includes having intermittent claudication as well.   Presentation:  Mr. Doe presents with intense  unrelenting pain in his right lower limb  notably worst at night. He also reports rest pain  indicating severe ischemia. On examination  the foot appears pale and cool  with shiny  atrophic skin. There are no palpable pulses below the popliteal artery. Non-invasive testing revealed an ankle-brachial index of 0.30  indicative of severe PAD. Distal gangrene is present on his big toe  and he has an ulcer on his foot that has not healed for a couple of months.  In conclusion  the history  clinical presentation  and investigative studies suggest that Mr. Doe suffers from Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  the severe form of peripheral artery disease. Therefore  urgent medical intervention and lifestyle modifications are needed to prevent limb loss and other serious complications.   Interventions:  The patient has received pain management and initiated on antithrombotic  statin  and antihypertensive therapy. Also  aggressive treatment of his diabetes is essential to slow the progression of atherosclerosis. Due to the involved toe's gangrene  the patient has been evaluated for either possible angioplasty or bypass surgery versus major amputation. He greatly benefits from a smoking cessation plan and alcohol intervention. A dietary consult was also arranged to address the nutritional factors contributing to the disease course. A referral to vascular surgery is warranted considering the severe ischemia and gangrene.
7,1,31,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial31,Patient Presentation: Mr. Alistair Green  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  was brought into our clinic with complaints of extreme restlessness  severe pain in the lower extremities  particularly in the left foot  even when at rest.   Medical History: He is a long-term smoker with a 30-pack year history and admits to consuming alcohol moderately. His past medical history includes chronic hypertension  diabetes mellitus for which he has been on Metformin for the past 8 years  and intermittent claudication which he has been managing for the last six years. He also had a minor stroke seven years ago  resulting in minimal residual right-sided weakness but did not lead to significant functional impairment.  The severity of the pain has now risen significantly  disturbing his sleep and affecting his day-to-day life  which led him to seek medical assistance. Upon physical examination  the left foot has pale skin and a notably lower temperature than the right  with absent pedal pulses and slow capillary refill. Mr. Green reported that the pain is alleviated when he places his leg in a dependent position  indicating probable gravity-facilitated blood flow.  In conclusion  consistent with the symptoms  history and physical examination  Mr. Green is presenting with critical limb ischemia likely secondary to peripheral arterial disease  exacerbated by his smoking habits and underlying medical conditions. Immediate attention and intervention are required to prevent further complications such as tissue necrosis or gangrene and potential limb loss.
7,1,32,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial32,Patient Profile: The patient is a 67-year-old African American male named John Smith  who resides in Brooklyn  New York. He has been married for 44 years  is retired  and lives with his wife. The patient was previously employed as a taxi driver  a job he held for over 30 years. He is a non-smoker  does not take any recreational drugs  but consumes moderate amounts of alcohol. There is no known family history of cardiovascular disease.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a significant medical history worth noting. He has type 2 diabetes  which has been managed with insulin and oral medication for 15 years. The patient also has hypertension  controlled with the use of an ACE Inhibitor named Lisinopril. Mr. Smith has documented hyperlipidemia  managed with a statin named Atorvastatin. He currently suffers from peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  confirmed five years ago with an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.6. An ABI less than 1.0 indicates PAD. There is also history of intermittent claudication  though recent events suggest a progression to critical limb ischemia.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Smith presents with a worsening condition of pain in his right lower limb at rest. The pain significantly intensifies during the night and is primarily localized in his foot and calf muscles. He also has complaints of toe ulcers that are not healing and persistent feet coldness. This has led to difficulty in walking  sleeping  and generally reduced quality of life.  Given his presentation  and his medical background  the suspicion is that Mr. Smith’s PAD has progressed to critical limb ischemia. This is a severe stage of PAD where blockage in the arteries severely reduces blood flow to the extremities resulting in pain at rest  non-healing wounds  and even gangrene. Immediate investigation and intervention are crucial at this point as this poses a high risk of amputation or even death. 
7,1,33,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial33,Patient Presentation:  We are currently treating a 67-year-old African-American male patient diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Reports indicate that patient is having classic symptoms of critical limb ischemia such as rest pain  non-healing wounds  and gangrene in the right lower extremity  predominantly  his right foot.  Demographic Information:  The patient is a retired construction worker  married with three children  and lives in a suburban community. He is a non-smoker and denies use of any recreational drugs. He admits to consuming alcohol socially but within moderate limits. He is independent in his daily activities.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a significant past medical history including type II diabetes mellitus  which has been poorly controlled over the last decade. He has been diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  for which he had undergone previous angioplasty approximately two years ago. He also deals with long-standing hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both being managed with medication.  The patient had a myocardial infarction about five years ago  followed by a successful angioplasty and placement of a drug-eluting stent. However  he has shown poor medication compliance behaviour since his operation.  In addition  he was diagnosed with stage II chronic kidney disease secondary to his diabetes around six years ago and is under nephrology follow-up.  Furthermore  the patient`s family history involves cardiovascular disease as his father had a myocardial infarction in his early 50's. His mother on the other hand  had suffered a stroke at the age of 68.  Evaluation and treatment strategy for this patient will revolve around his vascular and nonvascular risk factors. Expectedly  it will involve multidisciplinary team input.
7,1,34,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial34,Patient Presentation:  Our patient today is Mrs. Kimberly Sanchez  a 64-year-old Hispanic female with a medical history significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) poorly controlled with Metformin and hemoglobin A1c of 8.5%. She is a long-term smoker with a 40-pack-year smoking history and reports rare alcohol consumption. She has no allergies and claims to have a relatively active lifestyle despite having recently retired from her accounting profession.   She has been suffering from chronic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) for the past couple of years. Recently  over the past three months  her condition has escalated to critical limb ischemia (CLI). She reports experiencing severe pain in her right lower leg even while at rest and shows significant power loss. Mrs. Sanchez' ulcers on her right toe persist despite regular wound dressings. Furthermore  her right foot feels cold to touch  with a noticeable delay in capillary refill.  The patient has been adhering to oral antiplatelet therapy and statins as prescribed for her PAD. Her other medications include Metformin for T2DM  as well as aspirin and Clopidogrel for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. She does not have a family history of thromboembolic disease.  In summary  Mrs. Sanchez  aged 64 years  from a Hispanic background  is experiencing critical limb ischemia which poses significant threat requiring appropriate intervention. Her primary risk factors include poorly controlled diabetes  chronic smoking  and a history of peripheral arterial disease complicating her clinical situation.
7,1,35,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial35,Patient Presentation  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 68 Sex: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Construction worker   Clinical Presentation: Mr. John Doe presents with symptoms that correspond to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He complains of unrelenting foot pain which is particularly bothersome at night. He describes the pain as severe  and it necessitates him to hang his foot over the side of the bed for relief. Additionally  he mentions intermittent claudication  which is a tight  cramping  or heavy type of pain in his right leg that is triggered by walking. Mr. Doe also reports reduced mobility and noticed a non-healing wound on his right heel recently. No immediate family history of peripheral vascular diseases was noted.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a significant medical history which includes long-standing uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He has a 45-year history of heavy smoking but quit five years ago when diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). He has survived one prior myocardial infarction and currently takes daily low-dose aspirin and a statin for secondary prevention. He was previously diagnosed with peripheral artery disease five years ago  and intermittent claudication was well-controlled on cilostazol until recently.  Summarily  Mr. Doe's risk factors including diabetes mellitus  hypertension  smoking history  and established peripheral artery disease make him susceptible to critical limb ischemia. Further clinical assessment and investigations are highly warranted to confirm the diagnosis and plan suitable interventions. 
7,1,36,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial36,Patient Presentation:  Our patient is Mr. Jackson  a 68-year-old African American male  who has presented with symptoms consistent with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).   Past Medical History:  Mr. Jackson has a significant past medical history  which includes hypertension for over 15 years  type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack year smoking history. About seven years ago  he had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention related to Acute Myocardial Infarction and has had chronic kidney disease (Stage 3b) for about 10 years. He also has a history of peripheral artery disease  which was diagnosed about 5 years ago.   Present Illness:  He has been experiencing a rapid progression of rest pain in his lower extremities  particularly severe in his right leg over the past couple of weeks. He complains of severe foot pain as well  particularly at night. He has also developed ulcers on his right foot for which he is getting regular dressing. He reports occasional claudication pain  difficulty in walking and recently he has noticed loss of hair on his right leg. He denies any fever or signs of systemic infection.  Family History:  His father had a stroke at an old age  and his mother has a history of coronary heart disease. His sister was also diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.  Social History:  The patient is a retired mechanical engineer. He has been a smoker for around 40 years and moderately consumes alcohol. His diet primarily consists of high carbohydrate and high saturated fat foods. He lives with his wife  and they have two adult children.   The aforementioned information correlates with the symptoms of CLI  such as pain at rest and the presence of non-healing ulcers or gangrene. His risk factors include age  race  long-standing diabetes  smoking  hyperlipidemia  and high blood pressure. Considering his symptoms and past medical history  it is crucial to further investigate and manage the condition promptly to prevent further complications.
7,1,37,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial37,Patient Presentation: We have a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient named Mr. Charles  who has visited our facility complaining of extreme discomfort in his right lower limb. He reports that the pain  primarily in his foot  has been progressive and significantly worsens when resting  often awakening him at night. He mentions the pain subsides slightly when he hangs his foot over the edge of his bed. He also notes additional symptoms  such as coldness of the debilitating leg  a noticeable reduction in hair growth on the limb  loss of pulse or a weak pulse in the limb  and delayed wound healing on the foot.  His past medical history is significant. He has been diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus for the past ten years  which has been relatively poorly controlled. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and has been a heavy smoker for the past 30 years  smoking approximately twenty cigarettes per day. He was diagnosed with hypertension five years ago  for which he's actively receiving treatment. Mr. Charles has never been diagnosed with heart disease or any vascular disease before.  There are no known drug allergies. However  due to his poor diabetes control  Mr. Charles is currently on metformin  gliclazide  and regular insulin administration. He is also taking atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia and ramipril for his hypertension.  In light of his symptoms  history  and habits  his condition aligns with critical limb ischemia  a severe blockage in the arteries of the lower extremities  which significantly reduces blood-flow. It is most commonly seen in patients with diabetes  hypertensives  individuals with high cholesterol  and chronic smokers  as in Mr. Charles's case.   This is a serious condition as it may lead to amputation and could potentially be life-threatening. Hence  it would be important to immediately investigate and initiate appropriate medical and possibly surgical intervention  based on the extent of the ischemia.
7,1,38,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial38,Patient Presentation:  I would like to introduce a 69-year-old African-American male patient  Mr. Jackson  who is currently presenting with critical limb ischemia. He is a well-known artist in the community and a retired high school teacher. He lives with his wife and the couple enjoys gardening and walking in the local park. He neither smokes nor consumes alcohol. Ethnicity has no bearing on his social connections or preferences  and he enjoys a wide network of friends from various backgrounds  races  and cultures.  Medical History:  He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes 13 years ago and has been managing it with lifestyle modifications and medication. Good compliance to medication has been noted. For the past 9 years  he has also been treated for mild hypertension. He had an episode of deep vein thrombosis 6 years ago that was successfully managed.  Current Presentation:  For the past three months  Mr. Jackson has been suffering from progressively worsening pain in his right calf particularly at rest or even minor activities such as walking short distances which previously were easily manageable. His clinical examination indicates ischemic rest pain  non-healing ulcers  and noticeable temperature difference in the lower right extremity. These symptoms clearly indicate a severe case of critical limb ischemia. He also reported intermittent claudication and symptoms of paresthesia  alongside frequent nighttime cramping in his legs. The patient also demonstrated a significant loss of pedal pulses in the right foot.  Recommendations:  Considering Mr. Jackson’s current symptoms and past medical history  he is at a fairly high risk of limb loss if not provided with immediate intervention. The extremity has to be revascularized as soon as possible via either endovascular techniques or surgical bypass in order to avoid amputation. Alongside  optimization of diabetes and hypertension control is absolutely necessary with close monitoring and adjustments to his current medication regimen.
7,1,39,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial39,Presentation Title: Critical Limb Ischemia: A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction   Patient's pseudonym: Mr. John Smith  Demographics: 67-year-old African-American male  Slide 2: Background Information Primary Complaint: Prior to admission  Mr. Smith has been experiencing progressive discomfort on his left lower leg. He describes it as an extreme burning sensation  more noticeable at nighttime inconveniently disturbing his sleep. He also reports non-healing ulcer on his left foot.  Slide 3: Patient's Past Medical History Mr. Smith has a significant history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial disease. He has been smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. Previous medical interventions include regular diabetic control medication and lifestyle modification advice such as dietary changes and exercise. He is also a known hypertensive patient.  Slide 4: Physical Examination Findings  Examination revealed a pale  cold left leg with loss of hair on the shin and foot. An ulcer was also detected on his left  forefoot  presenting with blackish discoloration at its center. Distal pulses were not palpable on the left leg.   Slide 5: Concluding Remarks Considering Mr. Smith’s medical history  his persistent lifestyle habits  and his current complaints  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was made. His condition is severe  and immediate medical attention was recommended to prevent further complications such as limb loss. His management plan involves revascularization procedures  optimized control of co-existing medical conditions  and implementation of healthier lifestyle changes.  This case underscores the importance of early recognition and intervention in managing critical limb ischemia  especially in high-risk populations like diabetics and smokers. The involvement of specialists for the management of this critical condition from the point of diagnosis is crucial  as a delay can lead to potential irreversible consequences. It is a reminder of how long-standing uncontrolled chronic diseases can potentially lead to such critical conditions.
7,1,40,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial40,Subject: Patient Presentation – Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Profile: The patient is a 74-year-old African American male patient named Mr. Jackson. He is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife. He is a nonsmoker but has a history of moderate-to-severe alcohol consumption. He weighs about 220 lbs and stands at 5'9''.  Presenting Issue: Mr. Jackson presents with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) with persisting discomfort and pain in his right lower extremity  particularly at rest and at night. He describes this pain as excruciating and says that it often interrupts sleep. He also reports decreased capabilities in daily activities  including walking and climbing stairs.   Physical Examination: Upon examination  the patient shows tangible signs of tissue loss  ulceration  and gangrene in the right foot. There's noticeable skin pallor upon leg elevation and rubor on dependency. Furthermore  palpation revealed a significant decrease in limb temperature compared to the unaffected left lower extremity. Pulse examination showed the absence or decrease of both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses on the right leg.   Past Medical History: Mr. Jackson has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years  controlled on metformin. He also lives with hypertension for 15 years  controlled on ACE inhibitors. He suffered a myocardial infarction 8 years ago  post which he underwent coronary stent placement. He also reports a history of hyperlipidemia for which he is on statin medication.  Family History: There's a notable history of heart disease and diabetes in his family. His father died of a heart attack at the age of 68  and his elder sister has been living with diabetes for over 15 years.  In summary  the patient’s life history  especially regarding the presence of significant comorbidities  makes him susceptible to developing CLI. His diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  and history of coronary artery disease confirm this predisposition. We will need to develop a comprehensive management plan for Mr. Jackson to maintain limb viability and improve his symptomology.
7,1,41,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial41,Title: Presentation of a patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient: Mr. John Doe  Age: 68 years  Sex: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Engineer  Presenting Complaint: Severe Rest Pain  Profound Weakness  and Non-healing ulcers on both lower limbs.  Demographics: Mr. Doe is a resident of Springfield  Illinois. He lives with his wife and his medical care expenses are mainly covered by Medicare.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has had a significant history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years  controlled with diet and metformin. He also has a 20-year history of smoking (1 pack/day  but quit 5 years ago). He was diagnosed with high cholesterol and hypertension 10 years back  which is presently under control with medication.  Active Medications: Metformin for Diabetes  Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension  and rosuvastatin for high cholesterol.  Physical Examination: Drastic weight loss noted. Both lower limbs show severe muscle atrophy with notable non-healing ulcers present on feet. Distal pulses are absent on both limbs. Skin is dry and pale  with areas of discoloration.   Laboratory Findings: Elevated blood sugar levels and increased total cholesterol levels were observed. A significantly low ankle-brachial index was found  indicating severe peripheral arterial disease.   Preliminary Diagnosis: Taking into account history  physical examination  and lab results  Mr. Doe’s presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia  likely secondary to his long-standing diabetes and vascular disease.  Conclusion: Mr. Doe’s case mandates urgent intervention - both peripheral vascular and glycemic management - to prevent potential limb amputation and to manage the severe pain effectively. A team-based approach involving a vascular surgeon  endocrinologist  dietitian  and primary care physician would ensure optimal care.

7,1,42,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial42,Introduction: We are presenting a case of a 65-year-old Hispanic male named Mr. Carlos Rodriguez who has recently been diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).   Demographics: Mr. Rodriguez is a retired factory worker  residing in Brownsville  Texas. He lives with his wife and his grandchildren. He has a fifteen-year history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. He quit smoking 10 years ago after a 30-year history and continues to drink alcohol moderately. His BMI indicates he is obese and he has a sedentary lifestyle.  Past Medical History: Mr. Rodriguez has managed his diabetes with oral antihyperglycemic drugs and follows up in a local diabetic clinic every three months. He has a well-controlled HbA1C status. His hypertension is managed with ACE inhibitors. Besides  he has dyslipidemia for which he has been taking statins for the past ten years. Five years ago  he had a myocardial infarction for which he underwent angioplasty and since then  he has been on low dose aspirin. His adherence to medication and regular follow-up has been satisfactory.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Rodriguez visited the clinic complaining of severe pain in the lower right leg  which has been progressing over the last month. He particularly mentioned rest pain and non-healing ulcer over his right foot. Further examination revealed decreased pedal pulses suggesting CLI.  Importantly  Mr. Rodriguez’s CLI most likely results from advanced peripheral artery disease (PAD)  contributed by his long-standing diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease  smoking  obesity  and sedentary lifestyle which all represent significant risk factors. This case demands immediate consideration for angiography and further interventions with a multidisciplinary care approach considering the severity of the patient's symptoms and risk factors.  In summary  this case presents the challenge of managing a patient with CLI  in the context of multi-system complications and multiple risk factors potentially contributing to his current condition.
7,1,43,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial43,Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. P  presenting with critical limb ischemia.   This patient hails from La Jolla  California and works as a retired school teacher. His socioeconomic status is middle class with currently good healthcare insurance through Medicare.   Medical History:  Mr. P has a significant medical history of uncontrolled Type II diabetes for the past 15 years.  He has been a smoker for over 40 years and consumes alcohol socially. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  periodically following a moderate medication regimen to control these conditions.  Symptoms & Primary Concern:  He reports experiencing significant pain in his lower right extremity  especially at night  for the past two weeks. The pain is described as a continuous  burning sensation accompanied by numbness and tingling. Recently  the pain has escalated to disruptive levels  disturbing his sleep and impacting his ability to perform daily activities. He also reports a non-healing wound on the same leg  which is a secondary concern as it indicated poor circulation in the limb. There are no known allergies.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the lower right leg cold to touch  hairless  and has a noticeably paler complexion compared to the left leg. There are no palpable pulses in the right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial.   Assessment:  Clinical presentation  history of smoking and diabetes  and physical findings strongly suggest Critical Limb Ischemia.  Plan:  The patient requires urgent evaluation and intervention  and will potentially need imaging to assess the severity and location of the blockage. Management will include optimization of his comorbidities  cessation of smoking  possible medical and/or endovascular intervention  and maybe a possible referral to a vascular surgeon.   In summary  Mr. P is an elder  Caucasian male  with a history of uncontrolled diabetes  hyperlipidemia  hypertension  and smoking; now presenting with critical limb ischemia  primarily affecting his right lower extremity.
7,1,44,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial44,Patient Presentation  I am presenting Mr. Samuel Johnson  a 69-year-old African American male with a history of unmanaged Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He presents with complaints of persistent pain and non-healing sores on his left foot for the past eight weeks  which have recently worsened.  Mr. Johnson is a retired construction worker  from Clayton  Missouri. He stays with his wife and his current BMI is 29. He has been smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years  which adds to his risk factors.  The patient reports severe pain in the left lower leg even while at rest. The pain amplifies at night while sleeping and gets relieved slightly when the foot is kept in a dependent position. He also reports that the left foot feels colder than the right. On physical examination  his left foot shows signs of tissue loss  pale skin color  absence of hair growth  brittle toenails  and distressing resting pain. Physical exam also revealed diminished pulses in the left lower extremity.  Mr. Johnson's medical history includes Type 2 diabetes which he has had for 20 years  but has been poorly managed due to his non-compliance with lifestyle modification and irregular follow-ups. His hypertension has also been poorly controlled for the past 10 years  and he has a significant history of hyperlipidemia.  He has not been hospitalized before for any similar condition. There is no known history of vascular or heart disease in his family. He does not have any known allergies.  Given his current symptoms and medical history  Mr. Johnson is suspected of critical limb ischemia. Comprehensive vascular testing and imaging might be needed to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the extent of arterial disease.
7,1,45,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial45,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia Case Presentation  Patient Details: Patient: Mrs. Dorothy Langley Age: 74 years Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired school teacher  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Langley reports having severe pain in her right lower limb  especially when at rest. She mentions having intermittent claudication symptoms during walking for the past several months. She also points out that the resting pain is worse at night  disturbing her sleep. Pain scale is reported to be 7/10. She also noticed the presence of two small non-healing sores on her right foot  and on examination  parts of her foot has become blackish.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Langley is a known case of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 15 years  frequently has uncontrolled blood glucose levels. She has Hypertension for 10 years  and Dyslipidemia for 7 years  and her last lipid profile reports high LDL levels. She has been a Smoker for 50 years  with an average of 15 cigarettes a day.   Family Medical History: There is a family history of cardiovascular disease; both her father and mother had coronary artery disease.   Drug History: She has been on oral hypoglycemics  ACE inhibitors  and statins in prescribed doses.  Previous Investigations: An ABI (Ankle-Brachial Index) test was ordered  which came back as 0.4 (indicating severe blockage).  Impression: Considering patient's age  history  complaints  examination  and investigations  Mrs. Langley is likely presenting with signs of critical limb ischemia  associated with peripheral arterial disease related to longstanding diabetes mellitus  dyslipidemia  hypertension  and smoking. Prompt intervention is necessary to manage her condition.  Future Plan: An urgent referral to Vascular Surgery team is advised for revascularization therapy after discussing the potential benefits and risks. Patient education about the prognosis and necessity for regular follow-ups and strict control and management of known risk factors is recommended.
7,1,46,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial46,Patient Presentation:  We have a 67-year-old Caucasian male patient  known by the name Mr. Ted Williams  presenting with signs and symptoms that appear to be consistent with critical limb ischemia. The patient has reported experiencing severe pain in his right lower limb  even while resting  and a non-healing ulcer on his right foot. There are color changes in the right foot with coldness and noticeably less hair growth. These symptoms have been significantly affecting his quality of life.  The patient's medical history indicates a powerful predisposition for peripheral artery disease. He has been a heavy smoker for 45 years and has a history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus. He has been on insulin therapy for the last 5 years. Mr. Williams also suffers from hypertension and had a myocardial infarction 3 years ago. While his ejection fraction was maintained  his effort tolerance has been steadily declining since the incident.   There are no known alcohol or drug issues  however  he has been struggling with obesity  with a BMI of 32. His psychosocial history is significant for major depressive disorder  for which he has been on antidepressant therapy.   Mr. Williams lives alone  and given his current symptoms  there are concerns about his mobility  and consequently  his ability to manage his daily activities and diabetes. Family support is minimal  as his only daughter lives out of state. He is currently retired  having worked as a truck driver for a major part of his life.  Given Mr. Williams' current symptoms and previous medical history  critical limb ischemia is suspected  warranting further investigation  including angiography to understand the extent of limb ischemia. If left untreated  he may face limb amputation  underlining the need for immediate  aggressive intervention. His quality of life and independence are noble goals worth striving for in the treatment plan.
7,1,47,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial47,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) Patient   Greetings    Today  I am presenting the case of a 65-year-old  Asian male  referred to as Mr. K  diagnosed with critical limb ischemia. He is an ex-smoker  with a 40-pack year history  heavy drinker and had a sedentary lifestyle for the past 20 years since he retired. His body mass index is 29 kg/m2  indicating that he is in the overweight range.  Past Medical History: Mr. K has a history of Type-II diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years  controlled with metformin  and hypertension  managed with losartan. He was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 5 years ago and had undergone a peripheral angioplasty. He denies any history of heart disease  stroke or kidney disease.    Presenting Conditions: He arrived at the clinic with complaints of severe pain in his right lower limb. His pain had gradually increased over the past few weeks  even at rest. He reports a notable decrease in exercise tolerance due to the pain  with previous claudication at 100 meters  now down to less than 20 meters. Sleep quality is compromised due to the severe pain  particularly during the night.  Examination: On physical examination  his right foot was cold to touch and had a dusky appearance. Distal pulses in the right lower limb were not palpable and capillary refill time was delayed. He has significant motor and sensory loss in the affected limb.  Currently  Mr. K's situation is quite precarious and demands immediate attention. His case of critical limb ischemia necessitates firm control of his diabetes and hypertension  and likely revascularization procedures to save the limb and avoid amputation. A multidisciplinary approach with tight glycemic control  blood pressure control  pain management  wound care  and physiotherapy would be vital for his recovery. Evaluation by a vascular surgeon is urgently needed.   Thank you for your attention. Any insights or recommendations for Mr. K’s management are much appreciated.
7,1,48,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial48,Patient Profile Presentation:  Patient Name: Mr. Robert Johnson. Gender: Male. Age: 65-years old. Race: Caucasian.  Occupation: Retired Accountant. Marital Status: Married  with three adult children. Religion: Roman Catholic. Home address: 23 Blue Jay Street  San Francisco  California.  Presenting complaint: The patient presents with severe pain at rest in the right lower limb  worsening over the past two weeks  accompanied by preliminary gangrene in the toes.   Medical History:   Mr. Johnson has a long-term history of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus  inadequately controlled over the past ten years despite oral hypoglycemic agents. He has been a smoker for 30 years but quit ten years ago. He has a history of hypertension for the past fifteen years  managed with ACE inhibitors and Diuretics. He also has a five-year history of hyperlipidemia and is on Statin therapy. He had an MI about four years ago and underwent angioplasty and stent placement.  Family History:   His father died of a stroke at the age of 70. His mother died of colon cancer at 76. There is a familial history of coronary artery disease and hypertension  with two of his brothers being treated for the same.  Social History:  Mr. Johnson is a non-drinker. As a retiree  he lives a predominantly sedentary lifestyle. He has been making efforts to maintain a healthy diet due to his diabetes.  Summary:  Mr. Robert Johnson is a 65-year old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and coronary artery disease. His current state of critical limb ischemia is most likely a consequence of his long-standing peripheral arterial disease  exacerbated by his diabetic status  and complicated by the onset of tissue loss in the form of gangrene. The severity of his symptoms  including rest pain and gangrene  suggests it is an advanced condition that might require aggressive therapies. Mr. Johnson’s chronic smoking and sedentary lifestyle might have also contributed to his condition. Engaging this patient in an immediate management plan is crucial to improve outcomes and prevent limb loss.
7,1,49,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial49,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male  brought in by his spouse due to severe  persistent pain in his left lower leg. The patient calmly reports that the intense pain has been present for about two weeks  progressively getting worse over time with significant worsening in the last 48 hours. The pain is not relieved by rest and has now begun to disturb his sleep.  Patient resides in the rural heartland  and is a retired farmer with a 40-year history of heavy smoking. His alcohol intake is moderate with no history of illicit drug use. His spouse reports a family history of arterial diseases  including his father who had an above-knee amputation due to Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD).  Regarding his past medical history  he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 12 years ago and has been on Metformin therapy. Subsequent to this  he was diagnosed with systemic hypertension 10 years ago  and he has been receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors. Lastly  there is a record of intermittent claudication and a remote history of myocardial infarction approximately 7 years ago.  On physical examination  his left foot appears discolored (cyanotic) with the toes being especially affected. Additionally  an ulcerative lesion is noted on the plantar surface of his foot. Tests show decreased pulses distal to the popliteal artery  and a non-invasive study reveals significant stenosis in the left superficial femoral and posterior tibial arteries. The diagnosis of critical limb ischemia is made considering his symptoms and findings.   Based on the severity of the condition and considering his risk factors  including age  hypertension  diabetes mellitus  past history of myocardial infarction  and chronic smoking  he is at high risk of limb loss if not urgently treated. His presenting symptoms of severe rest pain and evidence of tissue loss (ulceration) signify the critical nature of the situation. Now he is being referred to a vascular surgeon to discuss angioplasty or possibly bypass surgery.
7,1,50,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial50,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Ronald Thompson is a 69-year-old Caucasian male who presents with symptoms suggestive of critical limb ischemia in his right lower extremity. His chief complaints are severe pain in the calf and foot  non-healing wounds on his toes  and weakness in the right leg. Onset of symptoms has been gradual over the last six weeks  but the pain has intensified in the past week  particularly at night and while resting. He also reports noticeable changes such as discoloration and coolness of the limb.   Mr. Thompson is a retired mechanic with a past medical history significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  controlled on Metformin  and Hypertension managed with Losartan. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history  having quit 5 years ago. He admits being non-compliant with his diabetic diet and medications at times. Notably  there is no history of coronary artery disease or stroke. Mr. Thompson’s family history revealed that his father had peripheral artery disease and underwent leg amputation later in his life.   Mr. Thompson's physical examination revealed a pale  cold right lower limb with diminished peripheral pulses. A non-healing ulcer was noted on the big toe. Other systemic examinations were normal. Further investigations including angiography are planned to confirm the extent of the vascular occlusion. Considering the clinical presentation and background  the provisionary diagnosis of critical limb ischemia has been established.   In conclusion  Mr. Thompson’s risk factors for developing CLI include advanced age  male gender  diabetic status  a past history of nicotine addiction  and a familial predisposition to peripheral artery disease. These factors contribute significantly to the presentation of critical limb ischemia in him. Immediate treatment options to restore the blood flow would be discussed upon confirmation of diagnosis. 
7,1,51,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial51,Slide 1: Patient Presentation  Our patient  Mr. Williams  is a 68-year-old Afro-American male  a retired veteran  who presents with symptoms of critical limb ischemia (CLI). His concerns are severe  progressive pain in the lower extremity primarily at rest  non-healing wounds on the lower left leg  high cholesterol  and high blood pressure.

7,1,53,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial53,Patient Presentation:  We are discussing the case of Mr. John Smith  a 66-year-old Caucasian male presenting with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He is a retired engineer  a non-vegetarian  and resides in New York with his wife. He has a history of 40-pack year smoking but quit 5 years ago.   His significant past medical history includes Type II Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 15 years ago with poor glycemic control (latest HbA1c is 9%)  Hypertension for the past 10 years controlled on medication  and Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). He underwent a left femoropopliteal bypass 3 years ago. Additionally  he has a known history of Hyperlipidemia and Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 3. He has no known drug allergies.  Recently  Mr. John has been experiencing rest pain in the right lower limb  worsening over the last couple of weeks. There are non-healing ulcers in right foot for about 4 weeks duration. He also has noted color changes in his right foot. Further clinical examination showed weak pedal pulses in the right foot  prolonged capillary refill time  and decreased sensation in the same noted region  clinically suggesting critical limb ischemia. These symptoms have significantly impacted his mobility and quality of life.  In conclusion  Mr. John Smith  a 66-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including poorly controlled Diabetes  Hypertension  Hyperlipidemia  PAD  and CKD  presents with severe ischemic rest pain in the right foot  non-healing ulcers  and signs of advanced peripheral arterial disease. The overall clinical findings suggest a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia in the right lower extremity. Further diagnostic studies and therapeutic interventions are necessary for better limb salvage and to prevent further complications.
7,1,54,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial54,Patient Presentation  Introduction:  We present a case of a 73-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI). The patient is retired and lives with his son in the downtown area of the city.  Medical History:  The patient has a known history of long-standing tobacco use  having smoked 1 pack a day for about 50 years. He's a known case of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) for the past 12 years  and Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) for the last 10 years. His T2DM is currently being managed with Metformin. Hyperlipidemia has also been noted  which he manages with a statin therapy.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented to the clinic with severe rest pain in the right lower limb  especially in his foot. His son also noticed a non-healing wound on the patient’s right foot's sole. The patient has been experiencing intermittent claudication  particularly after walking a distance of around 100 feet  which was relieved with rest.  Physical Examination:  Gait was observed to be antalgic. Upon inspection  there was evidence of diminished hair growth on the lower extremities  skin pallor and shiny appearance  and a poorly healing ulcer located on the sole. Peripheral pulses were weak. The right foot was cold compared to the left one.  Assessment:  Upon evaluation  the patient's symptoms of rest pain  slow-healing foot ulcer  and intermittent claudication imply that he may have advanced PAD  also known as critical limb ischemia.   Planned Management:  Further investigations  including an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) and arterial duplex ultrasonography  are arranged to confirm the diagnosis. Depending on the severity  the patient may require revascularization surgery  aggressive control of modifiable risk factors  and medical management to alleviate symptoms. A referral to a dietician may also be necessary to help manage hyperlipidemia and diabetes better.  This case highlights the importance of early recognition and management of CLI  especially in high-risk individuals  to prevent irreversible damage and potential limb loss. Smokers  diabetics  and people with hyperlipidemia have a significantly higher risk of developing PAD and CLI.
7,1,55,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial55,Good afternoon everyone. Today  I am going to present the case of a 68-year-old Caucasian male who came in with severe rest pain in the lower extremities  specifically the left leg  for the past two months. He also noted non-healing ulcers on his left foot. He was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia.  He is a retired mechanical engineer and lives with his wife. He is a smoker with a history of consuming one pack of cigarettes daily for approximately 40 years. He quit smoking five years ago. He has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years  hypertension for about 13 years  hyperlipidemia  intermittent peripheral artery disease  and stroke with full recovery about a year ago.  His blood pressure was noted to be high on multiple occasions despite being on 2 antihypertensive drugs. His diabetes was sub-optimally controlled with a recent HbA1c level of 8.0% while on Metformin. His hyperlipidemia had been well-managed on statin therapy.  His presenting complaints combined with his past medical history and risk factors like diabetes  hypertension  and a previous pattern of smoking strongly suggest the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. A comprehensive vascular assessment would be appropriate to characterize his ischemic disease fully and help inform subsequent treatment decisions.

He has been managing these conditions with oral medications as prescribed by his primary care physician. Mr. Brown admits to smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for about 40 years. He denied a history of hyperlipidemia  stroke or coronary artery diseases.  IV. Recent Illnesses and Medications:  Other than his chronic conditions  Mr. Brown had a sinus infection three months ago  for which he was treated with antibiotics. He is currently taking metformin for diabetes  lisinopril for hypertension  and aspirin as a prophylactic measure.   V. Family History:  His father died of a heart attack at 72  and his mother died at 76 due to a stroke. He has one sister living diagnosed with diabetes and one brother living who is healthy.  VI. Social and Lifestyle History:  Mr. Brown lives alone in a bungalow and carries out his daily activities independently. He has a son and daughter living nearby who visit him regularly. Since his retirement  he has engaged in usual house chores and gardening. He admits to a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in processed foods.   In conclusion  Mr. Brown’s convergent risk factors: advanced age  persistent smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  sedentary lifestyle  and poor diet  fit the typical profile of a patient at high risk of developing critical limb ischemia. His current symptoms: severe leg pain and color changes in the foot  strongly suggest his condition. The next steps involve diagnostic tests such as ankle-brachial index  Doppler ultrasound  and CT angiography. If confirmed  the initiation of rapid intervention will be crucial to prevent further progression and possible limb loss.
7,1,57,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial57,Patient Presentation  Our patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male presenting with critical limb ischemia in his right lower extremity. He is a long-term resident of a mid-western U.S. city  retired from a career as a truck driver.   His BMI of 28 classifies him as overweight. He has been a chronic smoker for the past 40 years  but has been attempting to quit for the past 2 years. He admits to occasional alcohol drinking during social events.  The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  and peripheral artery disease. He reports being treated for hypertension for nearly 20 years and being diagnosed with diabetes 10 years ago which he acknowledges to poorly control  often leading to significant blood glucose fluctuations.  The patient also has a surgical history of appendectomy in his 30s and an inguinal hernia repair in his 50s. His mother had a heart disease  and his father had a history of stroke  introducing a genetic predisposition to cardiovascular disease.  In terms of his symptom presentation  the patient has been experiencing rest pain in his lower right extremity for the past few weeks  which has been progressively worsening. Over the past few days  he also noticed a dusky discoloration of his right foot. He reports significantly reduced physical activity due to the pain.  To summarize  we have a 72-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled diabetes  hypertension  and peripheral artery disease  who is currently presenting with critical limb ischemia. The top priority at this point would be to stabilize the patient and develop a treatment plan to manage his ischemia.
7,1,58,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial58,Presentation of Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information:   Mr. John Smith  a 70-year-old African-American male  presents with critical limb ischemia.   Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Smith reports that he has been suffering from severe pain in his right leg for the past few weeks  particularly below the knee  which is more profound during evenings and nights. He has observed that his right foot tends to be colder than the left one and has noticed a pale discoloration. He also has non-healing ulcers on his lower right leg while expressing difficulty in walking due to intense pain.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith has extensive medical history including hypertension for which he has been on medication for the past 10 years. In addition  he has type 2 diabetes mellitus that he has been managing with both oral medications and insulin for 15 years. He has had two myocardial infarctions  one occurring 5 years ago and another 2 years ago. He is a former smoker with a 45-pack-year history  which he quit 5 years ago after his first myocardial infarction.   He has a family history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  chronic kidney disease  and cardiac diseases. His father had a history of PAD  his mother suffered from chronic heart disease  and his older brother passed away due to a heart attack.   Patient's Lifestyle:  Mr. Smith is retired and lives alone. He enjoys playing chess and reading books. His diet could be better as he enjoys snacking and regularly consumes fast food. Although he is aware of the importance of regular exercise  he finds it very challenging due to his current condition and pain in his leg.   This constellation of age  gender  race  and lifestyle  along with his genetic predisposition and a history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and heart problems  places Mr. Smith at a high risk for severe forms of peripheral artery disease such as Critical Limb Ischemia.
7,1,59,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial59,Patient Presentation:  Patient's Name: Mr. John Smith Age: 67 years Sex: Male  Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Manufacturing Supervisor  Mr. Smith presents with a primary complaint of severe pain in his left lower leg  especially noticeable at rest. He reports that the pain tends to escalate at night and is alleviated when his leg is in a dependent position. He also mentions that he has noticed a non-healing wound on his left foot  which has been present for several weeks. Mr. Smith informs of experiencing numbness and coldness in his left foot with diminished hair growth in that region and a noticeable color change in his left foot to a pale  almost bluish hue.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith has been diagnosed with hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes for which he is on medication  for the past 15 years. He is also a former smoker  having quit smoking five years ago after almost 40 years of nicotine abuse. Unfortunately  he has a sedentary lifestyle and his dietary habits are poor. He has also had a previous history of transient ischemic attacks (TIA). There are no known drug allergies. He has had no surgeries in the past.  Family History:   There is a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father suffered from ischemic heart disease and died of heart failure at the age of 72  and his elder sister underwent a bypass surgery for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) while in her 60s.   This complete information alongside Mr. Smith’s symptoms suggest that he may be presenting with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries in the lower extremities which significantly reduces blood flow and is a serious form of Peripheral Arterial Disease. Immediate medical attention is imperative to prevent serious complications such as amputation or even death.
7,1,60,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial60,Patient Presentation:  We have a 68-year-old African-American male patient presenting with symptoms of critical limb ischemia (CLI). His full name is Mr. John Smith with an address at 204 Elmwood Street  Chicago  IL. He is a retired bus driver and predominantly left-handed. His symptoms include severe pain in his left leg  non-healing sores and ulcers on the lower surface of his leg  and a marked decrease in temperature at his foot.  Mr. Smith has a significant past medical history  which primarily includes type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with metformin and insulin for the last 12 years. He has a history of hypertension controlled by lisinopril for the past 8 years. He is a former smoker and quit smoking ten years ago. He also shows signs of mild chronic kidney disease based on his recent laboratory results.  His family history is notable for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. His father died at age 65 due to a heart attack  and his older brother underwent a bypass surgery at age 60. Mr. Smith's BMI places him in an overweight range  indicating lifestyle changes should be incorporated into his treatment plan.  Prior to his CLI diagnosis  he had peripheral artery disease  which was diagnosed 5 years ago and treated with exercise  a cholesterol-lowering diet  and medications.   Currently  the lack of sufficient blood flow to the left foot  secondary to the longstanding peripheral artery disease  has resulted in critical limb ischemia. There is no known history of allergies  and he reports adherence to his prescribed treatments.  In terms of social history  Mr. Smith has been married for 45 years  has two grown-up children  and lives with his wife. He denies alcohol or substance abuse.   The next steps include revascularization  either through surgery or endovascular intervention. Given his age and comorbidities  a careful evaluation of the benefits versus risks is needed.   In conclusion  Mr. Smith's CLI relates to his longstanding diabetes  hypertension  former smoking habit  and familial predisposition to atherosclerosis. Aggressive management of these underlying conditions is essential to delay the progression of his illness.
7,1,61,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial61,Presentation of Patient:  Our patient today is Mr. James B. Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian male from Lexington  Kentucky. He is a retired account manager and is currently residing with his wife. He is a non-smoker but has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. His BMI is calculated as 28  which categorizes him as overweight.  Main Complaint:  Mr. Smith has presented with critical limb ischemia (CLI) characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  and/or gangrene in his lower extremities - specifically his right leg  due to objectively proven arterial occlusive disease.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has an extensive past medical history that is significant for several comorbid conditions. He was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus in 1995  with poor glycemic control. He also suffers from Hypertension since 2000 and has been on anti-hypertensive medication. He suffered a minor heart attack in 2003 for which he has been on medication. His lipid profile has been abnormal with high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Consequently  he is on a strict low-fat diet and lipid-lowering medications.  Family History:  His family history reveals that his father had suffered from coronary artery disease and his mother was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.  Social History:  Mr. Smith has a history of moderate alcohol consumption  consuming approximately 10-14 units of alcohol per week. He has been a non-smoker for his entire life. He is a retired accountant  lives with his wife and has a caregiver visiting him daily for assistance.  Review of Systems:  On review of systems  Mr. Smith denies any chest pain  palpitations  or breathing difficulty  but acknowledges decreased exercise tolerance due to the pain in his legs. He also mentions intermittent numbness in his affected lower limb.  To summarize  Mr. Smith has several cardiovascular risk factors such as Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension  and hyperlipidemia that have increased his susceptibility to developing peripheral artery disease (PAD) and have exacerbated his CLI. It is imperative to manage these risk factors and treat his CLI as soon as possible to alleviate symptoms  prevent progression of the disease  and avoid potential limb loss.
7,1,62,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial62,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) Case Presentation  Patient: Mr. John Smith is a 75-year-old Caucasian male.  Demographics: He resides in a suburban setting in Chicago  Illinois. He is a retired automobile engineer with a moderate socioeconomic status. He lives with his wife and their two dogs.  Chief Complaint: John was admitted to our hospital with severe rest pain in the right lower limb  exacerbated by the last 48 hours with difficulty in walking. Notably  he describes a consistent numbness and cold sensation in his foot and calf  with mild discoloration of toes.  Past Medical History: He has a significant past medical history of hypertension (HTN) controlled with medication and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for the last ten years  currently managed with oral hypoglycemic. He also has a pack-year smoking history of 35 years but quit five years ago. There's no previous history of stroke or any other cardiovascular event.  Medication History: He is currently on Lisinopril for hypertension control  Metformin for diabetes control  and Atorvastatin for cholesterol. He adheres to his medications properly.  Family History: His father had a myocardial infarction (MI) and his sister has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Physical Examination: On examination  his right foot is colder than the other  pale and has diminished hair growth. Pedal pulse on the right foot is poorly palpable. Capillary refill time is delayed.  Based on the above-mentioned information  Mr. Smith’s symptoms are highly suggestive of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). We need to run a thorough diagnostic evaluation  including but not limited to  ultrasound Doppler  CT angiography  and/or ankle-brachial index. Interventional measures need to be considered along with aggressive medical management of his T2DM and HTN.  In conclusion  Mr. Smith's case illustrates how modifiable risk factors like smoking  poorly controlled diabetes  and hypertension contribute to the development of peripheral arterial disease and subsequent critical limb ischemia. 
7,1,63,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial63,Patient Presentation  I wish to bring your attention to Mr. Leonard  a 67-year-old African-American male who presents with critical limb ischemia (CLI). He is currently suffering from severe pain in his left lower limb. The discomfort persists even when he is at rest and there have been non-healing ulcers present on his left foot for the past few weeks.  Mr. Leonard has been battling Non-insulin dependent Diabetes Mellitus for the past 18 years. He is also hypertensive and was diagnosed with this condition 10 years ago  which is currently managed with medications. His medical history also indicates a past incident of transient ischemic attack (TIA) about 4 years ago. Unfortunately  Mr. Leonard has also been a regular smoker for over 40 years.  In reviewing his family history  it is important to note that his father suffered a fatal myocardial infarction at the age of 72 and his mother had a history of stroke in her later years. Further  Mr. Leonard's older sister is also a diabetic and has chronic kidney disease.  Mr. Leonard has been noncompliant with his diet and diabetic medications in recent years  leading to poorly controlled diabetes. His BMI upon examination was 30  indicating obesity. In addition  the duplex ultrasound revealed severe peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the left limb.  In conclusion  Mr. Leonard's established risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  tobacco use  family history of cardiovascular disease  attempted diet and medication non-compliance  and obesity have come together to exacerbate his condition resulting in critical limb ischemia. He will require urgent vascular surgical consultation with the consideration for revascularization. Continuous monitoring and stringent control of his diabetes and hypertension are also crucial in order to avoid further complications.
7,1,64,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial64,Patient Presentation:  We have a 69-year-old African American male patient  Mr. Johnson  who presents with critical limb ischemia (CLI). He is a long-term resident of a rural community in South Carolina and lives on a limited income. He has been a smoker for over 45 years and has a medical history of poorly controlled type II diabetes for almost 20 years. The patient is also hypertensive and has had hyperlipidemia for a decade  both under insufficiently managed medical treatment due to financial constraints and inconsistent follow-up visits.  For the past few weeks  Mr. Johnson has been experiencing severe pain in his right lower leg  both at rest and during physical activities  with the pain increasing at night. He also reports non-healing wounds on his foot and coldness in the lower leg. He has lost significant weight over the past month and experiences difficulty in walking due to the pain. His previous medical records show evidence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  Overall  Mr. Johnson's lifestyle  prolonged history of smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  coupled with symptoms of rest pain  non-healing wounds  and weight loss  make him highly predisposed to developing critical limb ischemia. Further diagnostic testing and immediate intervention are required to prevent the complications associated with this condition such as tissue loss  sepsis  and limb amputation.
7,1,65,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial65,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Anthony  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the hospital complaining of severe pain in his right limb. He is a retired school teacher and lives by himself. He is a long-time smoker with a 30-pack-year history and is a sociable consumer of alcohol. He describes the pain as persistent and worsening over the last couple of weeks. He often experiences pain at rest and particularly at night. He also reports difficulty in walking due to the pain and noticed discolouration of his foot.  Mr. Anthony has had a past medical history of uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus for the past 20 years. In addition  he was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 10 years ago for which he has been on medication  but with questionable compliance. He underwent angioplasty for coronary artery disease 5 years ago.  On physical examination  there are several non-healing ulcers on his right foot. His right lower leg appears to be pale  cold to touch with attenuated pedal pulses. His capillary refill time is more than five seconds. Further  a noticeable hair loss on the right lower limb adds to the severity of the condition.  Given his clinical signs and symptoms  history of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease  Mr. Anthony’s condition strongly indicates critical limb ischemia. 
7,1,66,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial66,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. Thomas Sanchez  is a 72-year-old Hispanic male who arrived at the clinic with severe  critical lower limb ischemia in his right limb. He has been complaining of escalating pain in his right lower limb for the past several weeks. He reports that this leg discomfort also interrupts his sleep and affects his ability to walk  further complicating his preexisting mobility issues. His current symptoms include rest pain  non-healing sores on his toes  and a cold sensation in his right lower extremity. Additionally  the skin of his right foot appears to be pale and slightly mottled.  He has a significant past medical history  which includes type 2 diabetes for the past 25 years  controlled hypertension for the past 15 years  and a known case of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) for which he's been undergoing treatment for the last 10 years. He has a 50 pack-years smoking history but has been a non-smoker for the past five years. He has stated his adherence to the prescribed medications for his existing conditions.  His family history is notable for cardiovascular disease  including his father’s myocardial infarction at a similar age and a brother with a history of angina.  He has no known allergies to medication. Current medications include Metformin 1000mg twice a day  Lisinopril 20mg/day  and Aspirin 100mg/day.  Given these demographic and medical details  the patient's critical limb ischemia and PAD are likely relating to his longstanding diabetes  smoking history  and familial predisposition to cardiovascular illnesses. Further diagnostic evaluations and formulation of a treatment plan are required.
7,1,67,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial67,Presentation of Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information:  • Name: Mrs. Betty White • Gender: Female • Age: 67 years old • Occupation: Retired school teacher • Ethnicity: Caucasian • Marital status: Widowed  Presenting Complaint:  Mrs. White was brought to the emergency department by her daughter who noticed her mother's left leg had turned pale and cool to touch. Mrs. White reported that she has been experiencing an increasing level of pain in her leg in the last few days  which mostly intensifies at rest  particularly at night. Besides  she mentioned that she has been finding it hard to walk even short distances without feeling severe pain. On questioning  she revealed that the pain is localized  radiating from the calf muscle towards her toes. She also admitted to noticing some black spots on her toes.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. White has a history of long-standing  uncontrolled type II diabetes. She was diagnosed 15 years ago and has had trouble managing her blood sugar levels due to a lack of consistent medication intake and poor diet control. She has struggled with regular follow-ups and has often missed her appointments with her diabetic care provider. She also has a background history of hypertension diagnosed seven years ago. Her medications include metformin  glipizide  and nifedipine. She quit smoking ten years ago but admits to a 20-year history of smoking prior to quitting.  Family History:  There is a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases. Her father died due to myocardial infarction and her older brother has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She also has a sister who is managing hypertension and diabetes  similar to her.  Social History:  Mrs. White lives alone but her daughter checks on her daily. She denies alcohol consumption. She was a school teacher until she retired ten years ago. She has minimal physical activity and admits to consuming a diet high in carbohydrates and fats.   This is a case of critical limb ischemia  highly suspected to be secondary to her peripheral artery disease  which happens as a complication of long-standing  poorly controlled diabetes  hypertension  and prior history of smoking. This diagnosis would be further confirmed by conducting an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test followed by angiography. Prompt management is needed in this case to prevent further complications like tissue necrosis and limb amputation.
7,1,68,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial68,Patient Presentation:  I would like to present a case of an 82-year-old African-American female known as Mrs. T. She resides in Fort Lauderdale  Florida. She has been a widow for the past 10 years and lives alone with the support of local community health care services. She is a former high school teacher who retired twenty years ago  and her primary language is English.  Mrs. T was referred to our clinic with the presenting concern of chronic leg pain over the last six months. She reports progressive pain in her right lower limb  even while at rest  and she identifies intermittent claudication. She has also noticed a non-healing wound on her right foot. The pain is excruciating enough to disrupt her sleep  indicating toward critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Mrs. T has a significant past medical history. She has been managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) for the past 15 years  which remains poorly controlled despite medication. She was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago  which is currently controlled with antihypertensive medication. She is also managing hyperlipidemia for the past 8 years.    She has a 30 pack-years smoking history but quit five years ago upon being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She denies any history of alcohol or illicit drug use. Her surgical history includes hysterectomy and cholecystectomy. Mrs. T has a pacemaker due to tachy-brady syndrome about three years ago. She doesn’t have any known allergies.  Her family history includes coronary artery disease (CAD) in her father  who passed away from a myocardial infarction in his 70s. Her mother had stroke at the age of 82.   Given the severe pain  non-healing wound  and her classic signs of limb ischemia  there is a high level of clinical suspicion for the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. An urgent vascular surgical consultation and appropriate diagnostic tests have been ordered to initiate the appropriate therapeutic management.
7,1,69,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial69,Subject: Clinical Presentation of Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: - Name: John Smith - Age: 67 years old - Sex: Male - Occupation: Retired engineer - Marital status: Widowed  Presenting Complaint: Mr. John Smith is a 67-year-old male patient presenting with severe pain in the right lower limb  which is non-responsive to analgesics and has been worsening over the last week. The patient also mentions having intermittent claudication for more than 6 months now. He reports of non-healing ulcers on his right foot  and the area looks blackened. Furthermore  he mentions that the right foot often feels cold compared to the left foot.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a significant medical history which includes: •	Hypertension •	Type II Diabetes Mellitus  •	Hyperlipidemia •	Coronary Artery Disease for which he had Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting 5 years ago. •	Smoking history - The patient has a 40-pack years history of smoking (he smoked a pack a day for 40 years but quit four years ago). •	Alcohol consumption - Minimal; he consumes alcohol socially.  Family History: •	His father died of heart attack at the age 70. •	His mother died at the age of 80 from diabetes related complications.   On examination  the pulses in the right lower limb are diminished. There is pallor and coldness of the right foot with non-healing ulcers observed on his right foot.  Investigations:  A non-invasive vascular study will be suggested to confirm the diagnosis. It includes Ankle-brachial index  Doppler ultrasound  CT angiography  and MR angiography.  Impression:  Among the preliminary impressions  the patient's symptoms  coupled with his past medical history  are suggestive of Critical Limb Ischemia of the right lower extremity. The proposed plan is to confirm the diagnosis with the help of further investigations and then refer the patient to a vascular specialist for revascularization strategies to prevent limb loss.   The patient will be educated about the seriousness of his condition  potential complications if left untreated  and the necessity of adherence to therapy to prevent possible limb amputation.   Team comments: Given his significant risk factors including age  hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  CAD  and significant smoking history  this patient will continue to be followed up closely by a multidisciplinary team involving a primary care physician  endocrinologist  cardiologist  vascular surgeon  and a diabetic nurse specialist.
7,1,70,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial70,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Doe Gender: Male Age: 64 Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Teacher  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Doe presents with critical limb ischemia  primarily characterized by major leg pain at rest  non-healing wounds on feet  and tissue loss. The start of these symptoms has been traced back to approximately three months ago  progressively becoming more severe over time.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has had a long history of cardiovascular disorders  notably a history of Coronary Artery Disease. He also has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus two type for 15 years. Consequently  he has been put on insulin therapy and has had previous instances of non-compliance with medication. His important records include a history of smoking for about 25 years  although he quit 5 years ago. Mr. Doe also dealt with high cholesterol before his retirement.  Current Medication:  Mr. Doe is currently under insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes and maintains a regimen of statins for high cholesterol.  Family History:   His father had a history of ischemic heart disease and passed due to a myocardial infarction in his late 60s. Mr. Doe's mother lived into her late 80s and suffered from hypertension and type 2 diabetes.  Social History:   Mr. Doe is a widower who lives with his daughter in the city. He has a limited physical activity. After retiring from his job five years ago  he’s majorly engaged in indoor activities only. He quit smoking five years ago and refrains from alcohol consumption.  Risk factors:  These include a history of smoking  advanced age  diabetes  high cholesterol  sedentary lifestyle  and existing cardiovascular conditions.  Physical Examination:  The physical exam conducted revealed a non-healing wound on his right foot  tepid peripheries  and diminished pulses in both lower limbs  more prominently on the right.  Taken together  Mr. Doe’s presenting complaint  medical history  physical examination  and risk factors are consistent with critical limb ischemia  a severe manifestation of peripheral arterial disease  primarily driven by a longstanding history of poorly controlled diabetes and a history of cardiovascular disease. He’s being referred for further investigations including an ankle-brachial index  duplex ultrasonography  and if needed  angiography.
7,1,71,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial71,Title: Case Presentation on Critical Limb Ischemia   Subject: Mr. James Kemp  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  Primary complaint: Mr. Kemp reports experiencing rest pain and non-healing sores on his left foot for the last two weeks. He also presents with noticeable discoloration of the affected foot  which appears pale and cold to touch.   Demographics: The patient is a retired schoolteacher  living in rural North Carolina. He is a lifetime nonsmoker and reports moderate alcohol use. He lives with his wife  with three adult children living independently. He does not report any known genetic or familial diseases.   Past medical history: Significant for multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis including hypertension (diagnosed 12 years ago)  hyperlipidemia (diagnosed 10 years ago) and type II diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 8 years ago). The patient had a myocardial infarction four years ago  which was managed percutaneously with drug-eluting stents. He has been taking aspirin  metformin  a statin and an ACE inhibitor for his conditions.  Physical assessment: The patient exhibits a weak pulse in the left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries in comparison to the other foot. He shows signs of ischemic ulceration on the left foot  with the affected area showing a dark discoloration.   Vital signs: Blood pressure is 142/88 mm of Hg  heart rate is 88 bpm  respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute  body temperature is 98.2°F  oxygen saturation is 98% on room air  and body mass index (BMI) is 31.   Clinical impression: The patient's symptoms  along with a compromised blood supply evident from a weak pulse  suggest a severe form of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  probably critical limb ischemia (CLI). The presence of risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and history of coronary artery disease further support this impression. Investigations like angiography  ankle-brachial index  and Doppler ultrasound may be necessary to visualize the extent of arterial obstruction  followed by relevant treatment strategies such as bypass surgery  angioplasty  or potentially amputation  if ischemia is severe. The patient also needs optimized control of his risk factors.
7,1,72,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial72,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. Brown  who resides in suburban New York.   Presenting symptoms: Mr. Brown presents with complaints of rest pain in the right lower extremity  which has been progressively worsening over the past six months. The patient notes that the pain seems to escalate at night when in bed  often waking him up and is relieved when his leg is hanging down. Additionally  he has developed a non-healing ulcer on the right foot's first toe. He also reports experiencing symptoms of intermittent claudication. He denies experiencing fever  chills  or recent trauma.   Past Medical History: Mr. Brown has an extensive past medical history  most notably  a known case of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  which is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. His other conditions include hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with ACE inhibitors and statins  respectively.  The patient has a 45-pack year history of smoking but quit ten years ago after undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery for ischemic heart disease. Mr. Brown also has peripheral artery disease  for which he had stents placed in his left lower extremity two years ago.  Family History: His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases  with both his father and older brother suffering from myocardial infarctions in their 50s. His mother died at the age of 70 due to stroke. Also  his sister  who is 68  lives with diabetes and hypertension.  Social History: Mr. Brown lives with his wife and is retired. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use but admits to a sedentary lifestyle due to his current physical limitations.  Physical Examination: Physical examination reveals a pale and cold right foot with reduced capillary refill. A non-healing ulcer measuring 1.5cm in diameter is seen over the dorsum of the right first toe. There are notably diminished dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses on the right side.  Based on the patient's history and physical findings  a presumptive diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia is made. Further tests including Ankle-brachial Index and angiography are planned to confirm the diagnosis and to decide on the appropriate line of management  which could be either surgical revascularization or endovascular intervention.         Given Mr. Brown's history of smoking  diabetes  and previous peripheral artery disease  it's clear he's at a high risk for developing severe peripheral arterial disease like critical limb ischemia. Therefore  it's of utmost importance to manage his risk factors more effectively and possibly prevent progression or recurrence of the disease.
7,1,73,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial73,Patient Presentation  I am presenting a case of a 65-year-old male Asian patient who was recently diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The patient's name is Chin Lim  residing at Beijing  China. He came into the clinic primarily complaining of continuous and noticeable leg pain even while at rest  coupled with accessibility issues due to non-healing sores  ulcers and gangrene signs on his toes and feet.   Mr. Lim is a retired construction worker  a nonsmoker  but with significant alcohol use history. He has a health profile with the following past medical history:   1. Diabetes Mellitus  Type 2 for the last 20 years with inconsistent blood sugar control. 2. Hypertension with medication management since the last 15 years. 3. Angioplasty (PTCA) for significant Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) five years ago. 4. History of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).  In terms of family history  Mr. Lim had a father who suffered a myocardial infarction at an early age and a mother who also suffered from diabetes and hypertension  which suggests a potential hereditary predisposition to such conditions.  Given the reduced oxygen supply and chronic inflammation due to Diabetes and Hypertension  which likely resulted in poor peripheral circulation  this case of Critical Limb Ischemia is consistent with atherosclerosis progression.  Further investigations and relevant interventions are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and extend patient-relevant care to prevent disease complications such as lower limb amputations. Immediate action and disease management are essential to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular events or even death.  This case underscores the importance of early detection  strict regulation of comorbid conditions  and adopting a more proactive approach towards one's health  especially with such significant past medical history.
7,1,74,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial74,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a Diabetic Patient   Patient Information: Patient's Name: Mr. John Ramirez Age: 64 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic  Occupation: Retired construction worker  History: Mr. Ramirez  a retired construction worker  suffering from Type 2 diabetes for the past 15 years has presented today with excruciating pain in his left leg. His pain has been worsening over the time period of the last couple of months and has been non-responsive to standard analgesics recently. Furthermore  he experiences temperature changes  weakness and numbness in the affected limb and has been finding it difficult to walk short distances.   Medical History: Along with the diabetes diagnosis  Mr. Ramirez unfortunately has a history of untreated hypertension and significant atherosclerosis  both identified ten years ago. He has also been a heavy smoker for over 40 years. Unfortunately  he has been rather non-compliant with his prescribed medications due to lack of health insurance coverage.  Physical Examination: On examination  his left foot was found to be pale  cold to touch with weak peripheral pulses. Foot ulcers were seen on the distal end of the left leg. The Ankle-Brachial index revealed a reading of less than 0.4  indicative of severe arterial disease.   Summary: In light of his medical history and the physical examination results  Mr. Ramirez is likely suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  an extremely serious form of peripheral artery disease (PAD). His condition is very severe and necessitates immediate intervention. Recommended steps include lifestyle modifications  cessation of smoking  strict control of diabetes and hypertension  and pharmacological interventions such as anti-platelets or anticoagulant drugs. Surgical revascularization may also be an option depending on the extent of the disease.  We  as a healthcare team  must consider Mr. Ramirez's socioeconomic constraints in managing his disease. It is critical that we take a comprehensive approach and make every possible effort to maximize the preservation of his limb while optimizing his quality of life.
7,1,75,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial75,Patient Presentation: Ms. Susan Thompson is a 68-year-old  Caucasian female presenting with symptoms indicative of critical limb ischemia in her left lower extremity.   Demographic Information: She hails from a suburban community  lives with her retired husband  and is a non-smoker. Susan is a former elementary school teacher and has been retired for 8 years now. She denies any use of illicit drugs or alcohol consumption but admits to a sedentary lifestyle over the past few years.  Past Medical History: Susan has a significant medical history  including Type II diabetes mellitus for the last 20 years which she manages with Metformin. She also has high blood pressure treated with Amlodipine and a record of high cholesterol levels managed with Atorvastatin. She was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 5 years ago. No known drug allergies have been noted.  Clinical Presentation: Susan complains of extreme pain in her left foot  even during rest  and this has been increasingly disturbing her sleep. The pain has worsened considerably over the past week. She also reports having coldness in the lower leg  numbness or weakness  and ulcer formation with no signs of healing on her left toe. She also confessed to experiencing impotence  which is affecting her personal life. She mentioned that she started limping due to the pain which interrupted her daily activities.  In conclusion  considering her history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  high blood pressure  PAD  and her current symptoms  Ms. Thompson's condition appears consistent with critical limb ischemia. This necessitates further vascular evaluation and immediate intervention to prevent advancement into severe stages potentially leading to limb loss. 
7,1,76,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial76,Title: Presentation of Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Introduction: Mr. John Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presents with clinical symptoms and signs consistent with critical limb ischemia. Born and raised in Chicago  Mr. Smith is a former coal miner  leading an active lifestyle  with some exposure to heavy  manual labor during his earlier years. He was referred by his primary care physician for further evaluation and management.  Presenting Symptoms: He reports a six-month history of severe  constant burning pain in his right lower leg worsened by activities and somewhat relieved by rest. About two weeks ago  the pain became more intense and persistent  occurring even at rest with associated progressive discoloration and coldness of his right foot. He also noticed few non-healing sores on his toes.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a ten-year history of well-controlled type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hyperlipidemia. He had been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) three years ago for which he is on Aspirin therapy. He underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery eight years ago. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years  currently  on two packs a day  and consumes alcohol occasionally.  Family History: Mr. Smith has a family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father had a fatal myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and his older sister has a history of stroke at the age of 60.  Physical Examination: Examination showed a well-nourished man in no apparent distress but with obvious discomfort in the right lower extremity. His right foot was noticeably cold with decreased capillary refill  and there was an absence of both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. There were several small  necrotic ulcers over the tips of his toes.  Diagnosis and Management: Based on his presentation  history  and physical examination  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia associated with Peripheral Artery Disease was made. Mr. Smith requires immediate intervention  given his unrelenting pain  foot discoloration and non-healing sores. Decision was made for an urgent consultation with a vascular surgeon to discuss potential limb salvage interventions. 
7,1,77,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial77,Patient Presentation:   Our patient is a 74-year-old African American male who presents with a severe complaint of constant and recurring acute pain in his right lower limb  more so during the night and often results in sleep disturbance. He reports the pain as being at its worst when the leg is elevated. He also complains of experiencing coldness  numbness and tingling sensations in his lower extremity. Notably  he disclosed the presence of a non-healing wound on his right foot that has persisted for the past three weeks.   His past medical history is significant for hypertension and dyslipidemia controlled with medications  type II diabetes mellitus managed with oral hypoglycemic agents for the past 10 years and a known history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). He quit smoking 5 years back  after 30 years of a pack-a-day habit. His BMI categorizes him as mildly obese.  Upon physical examination  there were notable changes in skin color and texture on his right lower leg and foot  with delayed capillary refill above the ulcerated area indicating poor perfusion. The non-healing wound on the foot appears as a shallow crater with a pale base and well-defined edges. Pulses in his right leg appear diminished  and greater than 2+ difference compared to his left side.  In conclusion  the patient's symptoms - rest pain  non-healing foot ulcer  and the physical findings of peripheral pulse deficits - are suggestive of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  an advanced form of PAD. His risk factors include advanced age  African American race  history of smoking  hypertension  dyslipidemia  diabetes  and obesity  all of which increase his susceptibility to atherosclerosis and in turn CLI. A comprehensive diagnostic and management plan should be formulated immediately to prevent limb loss.
7,1,78,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial78,Patient Presentation:  Good afternoon everyone  I will be presenting a patient with Critical Limb Ischemia.  Our patient is Mr. James Peterson  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  currently living in Brooklyn  NY. He was admitted to the ER for severe rest pain in his left lower extremity  consistent with the typical presentation of critical limb ischemia. The pain has been increasing progressively over the last three weeks  causing a significant decrease in his mobility  and disturbing his sleep. On physical examination  there were marked pale areas on the left foot  significant muscle atrophy around the calf region  and evident ulcers along the inner aspect of his foot.   Delving into his past medical history  Mr. Peterson is a former smoker  having consumed 1-2 packs/day for approximately 35 years before quitting five years ago. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 20 years ago  which has been moderately controlled with insulin therapy. He also has a history of hypertension  managed with B-blockers and ACE inhibitors. Four years ago  he was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) for which he underwent an angioplasty of the right lower limb.   Mr. Peterson's past surgical history includes an appendectomy and cataract extraction. His family history is significant  with both parents succumbing to heart disease in their late 60s.   Given his advanced age  smoking history  diabetes  hypertension  and history of PAD  Mr. Peterson represents a typical patient with critical limb ischemia - it is likely that his condition has progressed due to the cumulative effect of his risk factors.   This concludes my presentation of Mr. Peterson. Thank you.
7,1,79,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial79,Patient Presentation :   I would like to present a patient  Mr. John Doe  a 70-year-old Caucasian male who hails from New York  USA. He had reported a Chief Complaint of worsening pain in his left leg that started two months ago. The pain is described as severe and persistent  which gets even worse during nighttime or when he elevates his leg. He also complains of his left foot being unusually cool to the touch with a noted dark discoloration on his toes.   In terms of past medical history  Mr. Doe was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes twenty years ago  which is poorly controlled. He was diagnosed with Hypertension fifteen years ago. He is an ex-smoker  having quit smoking 10 years ago  but smoked for approximately 30 years prior to quitting. He was also diagnosed with Peripheral Arterial Disease  and has undergone multiple unsuccessful percutaneous interventions.   Family history includes heart disease and Type 2 diabetes on his father's side  both grandfather and father passed away due to complications linked to cardiovascular diseases.   Upon examination  Mr. Doe's left foot has noticeable gangrenous changes on the tips of his toes  compromised pedal pulses  and an Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) of 0.4  indicating severe arterial insufficiency. His ABI on the right is 0.9  which is borderline normal.  In conclusion  Mr. Doe's history of long standing poorly controlled diabetes  smoking  and hypertension makes him a high risk patient for severe peripheral artery disease  manifesting now as critical limb ischemia. Immediate intervention  including possible surgical approach and improved control of his risk factors  is indicated. Mr. Doe's scenario underscores the importance of rigorous preventive care in high-risk patients with peripheral artery disease.
7,1,80,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial80,Patient Presentation:   We are discussing Mr. Robert Wilson  a 69-year-old Caucasian male with critical limb ischemia. Mr. Wilson is a retired mechanical engineer  married with two adult children. He is a resident of the local town since birth and is quite active in community services.  Medical History:   The patient has a 10-years history of type II diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia indicating a significant vascular disease risk. There are also prior cardiac issues with an incipient record of myocardial infarction experienced five years ago. There is a long-standing history of tobacco usage  though quit three years ago but had a 30-pack year smoking history. Patient has no known allergies. There's no family history of limb or peripheral vascular diseases.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Wilson presented to the ER with complaints of severe  continuous pain in his lower left limb  predominantly at rest  that has been worsening over the last three weeks  accompanied by non-healing sores and ulcers on the foot. He also pointed out noticeable color changes in the limb  significant hair loss  reduction in muscle mass  and numbness in the affected area. He noted occasional episodes of feeling cold in the lower limb and has experienced significant difficulties in walking due to the pain.  Overall  the past medical history  along with his presenting complaints  has led to a working diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.   Further examinations are to be carried out  but the patient's condition necessitates urgency in diagnosis and treatment due to the high risk of amputation or even death if left untreated. We will require vascular imaging studies and would consider revascularization procedures  dependent on the severity and extent of vascular occlusion found.
7,1,81,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial81,Presenting Patient: Mr. John Wilson  a 72 year old male  retired construction engineer.  Demographic Information:  Mr. Wilson is a Caucasian male  married with two adult children. He resides in the suburban area with his wife. He admits to being a former heavy smoker  with a 50 pack year history  but quit 10 years ago. He is a social drinker and denies any illicit drug use or toxic exposure.  Chief complaint:  Mr. Wilson presents with severe chronic pain in his right lower leg  which has worsened over the past six months. The pain was initially intermittent  more pronounced during walking and relieved by rest. Recently  it has nagged him even at rest  particularly at night. His right foot appears paler than the left  and feels cold to touch.   Past Medical History: Mr. Wilson has a significant medical history which includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  all managed with medication. He had a myocardial Infarction 5 years ago  for which he underwent angioplasty and he has been on cardiac medications since then.   Review of Systems:  Mr. Wilson complains of a weight loss  fatigue  decreased appetite  and difficulty in sleeping due to persistent pain. No complaints of fever  cough  chest pain  palpitation  gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms.   Family History: His father died of a heart attack at the age of 70 and his mother died of a stroke at the age of 65. His elder brother had a quadruple cardiac bypass surgery at the age of 55.  Conclusion: Given my client's history of cardiovascular disease  longstanding uncontrolled diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension  along with typical symptoms and physical findings  I suspect his presenting complaint can be attributed to Critical Limb Ischemia  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to cause severe pain and skin ulcers or sores. His history of being a heavy smoker also plays a significant risk factor. Immediate vascular assessment is warranted and appropriate interventions are to be undertaken.
7,1,82,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial82,Patient Presentation:  We have a 72-year-old female patient  Mrs. Eleanor Park  she is a resident of Baltimore  Maryland. She belongs to the Caucasian ethnicity and lives with her 75-year-old husband. She is a retired school teacher and enjoys gardening as her hobby.   The patient has been suffering from progressive pain in her right lower extremity over the past few weeks which has now become unbearable and chronic  restricting her mobility. The pain persists even during resting hours  indicating critical limb ischemia. Intermittent claudication initially presented six months ago  which has intensified over the period. There's also noticeable discoloration and coolness in comparison to the left lower limb  indicating severe ischemia. No latency in capillary refilling  though.   From her medical records  the patient has a history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus for the past 20 years  managed with Metformin. She has hypertension under control with daily doses of Amlodipine. She had suffered a Myocardial Infarction 5 years ago  which was managed successfully with Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) and drug therapy. The patient is also a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago. She does not consume alcohol.  Family history includes Cardiovascular Diseases on the father's side  who died due to a massive stroke. Mother had passed away due to old age with Alzheimer's disease. Her younger brother is living with diabetes and hypertension  echoing a pattern of familial hypertension and diabetes.  Given her medical history  age  and current symptoms  she is at high risk and immediate diagnostic and intervention strategies are required to prevent limb loss in this case of critical limb ischemia.
7,1,83,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial83,Patient Presentation:  Good morning everyone   Today  I am presenting a 68-year-old African American male  Mr. Jackson  who currently lives in Portland  Oregon. He is a retired steelworker  a regular smoker for the past 45 years  and has a history of occasional alcohol consumption.  Mr. Jackson had no significant health complaint until five years ago  when he was diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite several management strategies  his diabetes and hypertension poorly controlled. He also has a regarded history of hyperlipidemia.   He presents today with a chief complaint of severe pain in his left lower limb  particularly in the calf and foot  for the past six months. The pain exacerbates with even minimal exertion and occasionally occurs at rest. He reports having non-healing wounds on his left foot and states that it worsens over time. Furthermore  he mentions intermittent claudication  deterioration in his mobility  and immense pain disrupting his sleep at night which suggests rest pain.   He does not have any known allergies. He has been adhering to a regimen of Metformin  Lisinopril  and Simvastatin for his diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia respectively  with irregular compliance. Mr. Jackson has no surgical history  and there is no noted familial predisposition to vascular diseases.  In summary  Mr. Jackson’s prolonged smoking history  poor control of risk factors such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes  as well as his typical symptoms  suggests a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). However  further investigations  such as Ankle-brachial index (ABI) and imaging studies like Doppler ultrasound  CT angiography or MR angiography  will be beneficial to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the disease.   Thank you for your attention. I welcome any questions and collaborative discussion on Mr. Jackson's diagnosis and potential treatment options.
7,1,84,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial84,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Williams is a 62-year-old Caucasian male presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI) in his left lower extremity. Criminal limb ischemia is a severe blockage in the arteries of the limb or limbs that significantly decreases blood flow leading to pain and tissue death  thus leading to amputation if left untreated.   Mr. Williams first noticed pain in his lower leg about six months ago that has progressively worsened. He reports the pain has significantly increased over the last two weeks. Recently he's started to feel the pain even at rest. He also reports non-healing ulcers on his left foot  and he feels the foot is colder than the right one.   In terms of Mr. Williams' past medical history  he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 15 years ago  which he has managed with oral hypoglycemic agents and lifestyle modifications. He was also diagnosed with hypertension five years ago  which he controls with lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medication. Mr. Williams is a former smoker who stopped 10 years ago  after a 30-year history of daily smoking.  There is no known family history of cardiovascular disease or peripheral artery disease. He has no known allergies. He is retired and lives with his wife. He exercises 3 to 4 times weekly  mostly walking in his neighbourhood.   Mr. Williams' illness is consistent with the development of CLI  contributed to by his past medical history of long-standing diabetes and smoking. These are significant risk factors for peripheral arterial disease which is the most common cause of CLI. His hypertension can further aggravate atherosclerosis. This man needs comprehensive medical care and treatment planning to prevent possible limb amputation. His treatment should include aggressive medical therapy  potential revascularization procedures  preventative foot care  and effective management of diabetes and hypertension.
7,1,85,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial85,Patient Presentation:  Good evening  I'm presenting a 63-year-old African-American male patient  Mr. Anthony Sanders  with critical limb ischemia. Mr. Sanders has been a pack-a-day smoker for the past 40 years and has a past medical history significant for uncontrolled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and peripheral arterial disease.   Mr. Sanders was first diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease about a decade ago  reporting intermittent claudication in his right calf. In recent months  however  he complained of escalating pain in the same leg while at rest  particularly at night  which was relieved by hanging the limb over the side of the bed. He also revealed that an ulcer about the size of a half-dollar has appeared on his right foot  specifically on the great toe  which has not shown significant healing despite regular care and efforts to maintain foot hygiene.  Upon examination  the patient's right leg appeared pallid compared to the left  with decreased hair growth  dystrophic toenails  and a cold sensation to touch. His foot pulses were notably decreased  and an ankle-brachial index was obtained revealing a reading of 0.40 on the right side  indicating severe ischemia.  The primary aim for Mr. Sanders' management is to alleviate pain  to heal his foot ulcer  and to prevent limb amputation considering his quality of life and overall functional status. Given his history and recent symptoms  vascular surgery consultation would be an appropriate step moving forward.   The patient's critical limb ischemia seems to be intricately linked to his longstanding smoking history  peripheral arterial disease  and poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes. Thus  managing these conditions while working on wound care  pain control  and possible revascularization will be integral parts of his treatment and monitoring plan.   Given his risk factors and current state  Mr. Sanders needs appropriate education on limb care  importance of good foot hygiene  optimal control of diabetes  aggressive management of blood pressure  and assistance in smoking cessation to prevent any further progression.
7,1,86,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial86,Title: Case Presentation – Critical Limb Ischemia Patient  Patient's Profile: Name : Mr. Johnson  Age : 68 years old Race : Caucasian Gender : Male Occupation : Retired Engineer  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Johnson presents with chronic  profound pain in his lower right leg  particularly when he tries to walk or exercise. Accompanying this  he reports coldness in his lower leg  some numbness  and the presence of non-healing ulcers on his foot. His wife also noticed a change in the color of his leg which shows pallor in elevation and bright red in dependent position - indicating severe blood flow deficiencies.  Demographics: Mr. Johnson is a former smoker and has a significant history of alcohol consumption. He follows a diet that is high in saturated fats  contributing to his obesity (BMI 32). Despite his retired status  he is quite active societally  regularly participating in community service and catch-ups with his grandchildren. He enjoys good familial support but finds it hard to maintain adherence to his medication regimen.  Past Medical History: History remarkable for 20 years of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and 15 years of hypertension  along with occasional instances of arrhythmia. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) from a previous diagnosis of coronary artery disease 5 years back. He was also diagnosed with peripheral artery disease in his left leg last year and underwent a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty successfully. Oral antiplatelet therapy has been part of his chronic medication besides his diabetes and hypertension medications.  Clinical Summary: Given the demographics and past medical history  the chronic limb-threatening ischemia symptoms can be attributed to a combination of Mr. Johnson's non-compliance with his chronic medications  his long-term diabetes  obesity  history of smoking  and poor diet choices that have likely contributed to atherosclerotic progression. Further investigations are needed to assess the extent of the disease and to plan the necessary interventions. His prognosis would depend largely on his adherence to treatments and lifestyle modifications.
7,1,87,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial87,Patient Presentation  Good day everyone  the patient I am discussing today is a 72-year-old Caucasian male presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI). He is a retired school teacher and currently lives with his wife; he has no dependents with him. He has been a lifelong smoker with a pack-year history of 48  and has been an occasional alcohol drinker.   Regarding relevant past medical history: The patient has an established diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and has been on oral hypoglycemics for the past 15 years. His sugar control  however  has been suboptimal. He also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which he has been managing with medication for 10 years. The patient is currently on medication for both conditions. Eight years ago  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease which was being managed conservatively till now.  The patient has now presented with worsening rest pain in his right lower limb  which has been troubling him for the past 6 months. His recent symptoms include non-healing ulcers and significant weight loss resulting from decreased appetite.  Evidently  our aim will be to provide symptomatic relief  to prevent the progression of the disease  and to avoid limb amputation using possible intervention  such as vascular bypass surgery. However  further investigations are required to confirm the severity and the best treatment approach.  In conclusion  this patient is a classic presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia  which is unfortunately too common amongst patients with risk factors like smoking  diabetes  and hypertension. Early recognition and aggressive management of these risk factors are imperative in preventing such severe complications.  Does anyone have any questions about this patient's history or condition?

Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith visited the hospital with severe pain in his lower legs and feet  which has escalated over the last month. He expressed that the pain is more severe at night and elevating his limbs often offers little relief. He has also noticed wounds on his feet that are slow to heal and some areas of skin discoloration.  III. Past Medical History:  - Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes 15 years ago  which is poorly controlled. - Cardiovascular disease diagnosed 10 years ago. - History of hyperlipidemia. - Nonsmoker  but smoked one pack a day for 20 years before quitting 15 years ago. - Penicillin allergy.  IV. Medications:  He is currently on Metformin  Lisinopril and Atorvastatin.  V. Family History:  His father suffered from peripheral artery disease and had a stroke at the age of 72. His mother had hypertension and his sister was recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.  VI. Social History:  He lives with his wife and is retired. He used to enjoy walking in the local park with his wife  however  due to pain and discomfort he is unable to do so.  VII. Physical Exam:  On examination  Mr. Smith's lower limbs appeared pale and cold to touch  with a marked decrease in popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial pulses. Non-healing ulcers were noted on his feet.  VIII. Diagnostic Impression:  Based on the clinical presentation and physical examination  the patient is likely suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  which fits with his history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Further diagnostic procedures such as ankle-brachial index  ultrasound and angiography should be conducted for a definitive diagnosis and potential consideration for revascularization procedures.  IX. Treatment Plan: Pending formal diagnosis  possible plans include aggressive control of his diabetes and hyperlipidemia  pain management  wound care  smoking cessation education even though he has quit  and possibly referring the patient to a vascular surgeon.

However  his compliance to medication and daily exercise regimen was reported to be inconsistent.  Social History:  He has been a smoker for the past 40 years and consumes alcohol socially. He admits to have a sedentary lifestyle with a diet high in fats and carbohydrates. He's widowed for the past 4 years and lives alone with occasional visits from his two adult children working out of town.  Given Mr. Doe's history and non-healing ulcers  it is urgent to manage his CLI to avoid complications  such as gangrene and amputation  and to improve the quality of his life.
7,1,91,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial91,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Information: Our patient is a 67-year-old African American male  weighing 80 kg  and reports as a non-smoker. The patient resides at an assisted living facility in Charleston  SC  and retired 5 years ago from a career in construction.   Presenting Issue: The patient is presenting with acute onset of pain in his right lower extremity  specifically in the calf area  that's unrelieved by rest. The patient describes the pain as a severe burning sensation  rating it 7 out of 10 on the pain scale. The pain is accompanied by numbness and coldness in the extremity. The patient also indicates a recent history of non-healing ulcers on the foot.  Past Medical History: Notably  the patient has a long-standing history of peripheral artery disease. His past medical history also shows a record of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which are being managed with Lisinopril and Metformin respectively. He further suffers from occasional episodes of angina. The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery 8 years ago for the management of ischemic heart disease.  Family History: His father succumbed to a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. Both the patient's mother and older brother were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Current Assessment: Given the history and current symptoms  the patient is suspected to have critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.    Further tests  including imaging of the blood vessels via ultrasonography or angiography  are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and severity of the disease  and to guide interventional or surgical procedures if necessary.
7,1,92,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial92,Patient Presentation:  This is a case of Mr. Allen  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  who presents with complaints of severe rest pain in the right lower extremity  particularly in the foot. He reports a significant weight loss in the past few months due to loss of appetite. There is no associated fever  trauma or surgery prior to the onset of symptoms.  Mr. Allen is an ex-tobacco smoker  with a 40-pack-year smoking history (stopped 5 years ago)  has been consuming alcohol occasionally for the past 25 years  and does not report any form of recreational drug use. His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he is on oral medications  peripheral artery disease (PAD)  for which he had undergone angioplasty of the left limb two years ago  and hypertension  which is well controlled on a prescribed antihypertensive medication regimen.  Upon examination  noticeable signs include skin discoloration on the right foot  non-healing ulcers on the foot's lateral aspect  and thickened toenails. Furthermore  peripheral pulse assessment shows significant attenuation of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. His BMI indicates he is overweight.  Diagnostic tests are planned to confirm the definitive diagnosis  but the presenting symptoms and history are suggestive of critical limb ischemia (CLI). Early intervention is key to avoid severe complications such as limb amputation. The multidisciplinary approach to his management would involve a vascular surgeon  primary care physician  dietitian  and diabetes educator  given his underlying comorbidities.
7,1,93,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial93,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who presents with critical limb ischemia of his right lower extremity. He currently resides in Raleigh  North Carolina and is a retired engineer. He has been married for 50 years with three grown children and six grandchildren.  His presenting symptoms include severe pain in his right foot at rest  non-healing sores on his right lower leg and foot  and a noticeable color change in his right foot to a pale coloration. Additionally  the patient has reported increasing difficulty in walking due to muscular fatigue and weakness in the right leg.   He has a significant past medical history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  which he has had for the past 25 years. The patient has been moderately compliant with diabetic diet and medication. Due to this  his blood sugar levels are inconsistently controlled. He has a history of diabetic peripheral neuropathy which was diagnosed 10 years ago. Additionally  the patient has been diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol levels. He has been on medication for both for the past 15 years.  He is a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago after a 30-year smoking history. He denies alcohol use but admits to occasional over-the-counter NSAID use for arthritis.  Family history includes his father  who passed away at the age of 65 from a myocardial infarction. The patient's mother is alive at 90 with a history of stroke at age 80. His two older brothers are alive and well  but one is also a diagnosed Type II diabetic.  On physical examination  the right foot showed decreased capillary refill  loss of hair  thinning skin  and ulcerations at the heel and distal aspect of the big toe.  The patient is concerned about his health status as his pain and mobility difficulties are affecting his quality of life. This requires immediate and comprehensive medical attention to alleviate his symptoms and prevent further complications. Talk therapy and support could also be beneficial considering the risk of emotional impact due to chronic disease and decreased mobility.
7,1,94,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial94,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Description:  The patient is a 75-year-old African American male  Mr. John Doe. He is a retired engineer  living with his wife in their home. His BMI is 28. He is a former smoker with 20 pack-years but has been tobacco-free for the last 15 years. Mr. Doe consumes alcohol occasionally during social events  denying any habitual use.   Chief Complaint: Mr. Doe presents with non-healing ulcers in his right foot  which have persisted for approximately five weeks. He describes experiencing severe pain in his right leg  even while at rest. He also reports discomfort while walking  necessitating frequent breaks before reaching his destination.   Past Medical History: Mr. Doe's past history includes Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which he has managed for the past 20 years with metformin. He also has a history of uncontrolled hypertension  for which he has been prescribed lisinopril. His medical history also includes hyperlipidemia  which is managed with atorvastatin. He had a myocardial infarction 10 years ago  with a subsequent double vessel coronary artery bypass graft  which has left him with occasional angina. He admits to poor medication adherence due to medication cost.   Family History: His family history is significant  with an elderly father who suffered a stroke and a sibling who died of myocardial infarction at a young age. His mother had diabetes and a younger brother currently being treated for peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Current Diagnosis: After complete physical examination  including an ankle-brachial index test and arterial doppler ultrasound of the lower extremity  Mr. Doe has been diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) as the cause of his consistent lower extremity pain and non-healing foot ulcers. His clinical presentation  his chronic conditions  particularly poorly managed Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension  coupled with his smoking history  make him high risk for this condition.  Recommended course of action:  CLI is a serious condition requiring prompt revascularization intervention. A multidisciplinary approach involving a vascular surgeon  diabetic specialist  and wound care expert is recommended to manage this case effectively. Timely intervention will significantly reduce the chance of major limb amputation and improve quality of life. Mr. Doe will also need counseling and assistance regarding medication adherence  lifestyle modification  smoking cessation  and glucose control.   Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of recognizing the symptoms of CLI promptly and addressing the risk factors to salvage the limb and improve patient outcome. Special emphasis should be put on managing diabetes and hypertension  and controlling and treating hyperlipidemia.
7,1,95,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial95,Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male presenting with critical limb ischemia primarily in the right lower extremity and symptoms of muscle pain  cold feet  and non-healing ulcers. The patient has been a smoker for 50 years with approximately a 30 pack-year history. He quit smoking  though  two years ago. He has a fairly sedentary lifestyle and his diet could be described as high in processed and fatty foods.   Past Medical History:   He has been living with uncontrolled type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the last 20 years  complicated with peripheral neuropathy. His HbA1c level fluctuates between 7.5% and 9.0%. He also has Hypertension that is relatively controlled with medications.   The patient was diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease stage 3 about five years ago and is under a nephrologist’s care. He has a history of Coronary Artery Disease and has undergone Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with stenting two years ago.  The patient denies any history of stroke  transient ischemic attack  atrial fibrillation  deep vein thrombosis  or pulmonary embolism. He does not take any anticoagulants but is on a statin for Dyslipidemia.  Family History:   He also has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father had a heart attack in his 60s and his mother died of stroke in her 70s.  In conclusion  the patient is at significant risk due to his long history of smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia  chronic kidney disease  and CAD. His sedentary lifestyle and poor diet also factor into the high risk. Urgent comprehensive assessment by a vascular surgeon is mandatory for this case.
7,1,96,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial96,Patient Presentation:  Mr. George Palmer is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  currently living in Jacksonville  Florida. He is a retired army veteran and has been relatively active since his retirement. Mr. Palmer presented complaining of severe pain in his right lower extremity  particularly when he walks  along with numbness and tingling sensation. He has noticed that these symptoms worsen when the leg is elevated and also reports coldness in the affected extremity.  Demographics:  Mr. Palmer was born on September 7  1952  making him 68 years of age as of the present time. He was born in Atlanta  Georgia and moved to Jacksonville  Florida upon retirement. He is a widower with 2 children  both currently living out of state. He lives alone but maintains a close relationship with his daughter who visits frequently.  Past Medical History:  In 2006  Mr. Palmer was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. His diabetes has been reasonably well-controlled with Metformin and diet changes  although he mentions recent struggles with maintaining strict diet control due to living alone. His most recent HbA1c was 7.8%  suggesting poor glycemic control in the past few months.   In 2013  he was diagnosed with hypertension which has been under control with Lisinopril. He also was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia in 2015  managed by a combination of diet and statin therapy (Atorvastatin). He reports good adherence to his medication regimen but admits to occasional lapses due to forgetfulness.  He has a significant history of tobacco use  with a 40-pack year history (2 packs/day for 20 years). He successfully quit smoking in 2011 following a diagnosis of COPD. Despite this  he does experience chronic shortness of breath and utilizes an albuterol inhaler for symptomatic relief. He denies a history of coronary artery disease  stroke or peripheral artery disease.  Given his presentation and past medical history  it is plausible that Mr. Palmer may be experiencing critical limb ischemia  which may be due to underlying peripheral vascular disease  likely secondary to longstanding diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and history of smoking. It is strongly advised that further diagnostic investigations  potentially including angiography among other tests  be pursued to confirm this diagnosis and guide subsequent treatment.
7,1,97,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial97,Patient Presentation:  Today we are discussing an individual named Patricia Thompson  a 68-year-old Caucasian female diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Patricia resides in a rural residential area and had retired from her teaching profession.  Patricia presents with complaints of pain  aching  and cramping in her right lower extremity  consistent with CLI's typical symptoms. She has noticed that this discomfort is amplified during periods of physical activity but eases up when at rest. She's recently noticed a non-healing wound on her right foot  accompanied by pallor in her leg.  Her medical history is highly relevant to today's presentation. She has a 15-year history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus and has struggled with poor glycemic control  despite multiple medication adjustments.   Patricia has also been treated for hypertension and high cholesterol over the last ten years and has been on an antihypertensive and statin regimen. However  she admits struggles with lifestyle modification and medication compliance due to various socio-economic issues  such as lack of access to healthy foods and physical activity opportunities in her rural community.  In addition  Patricia has a 30-year smoking history (1 pack per day)  and although she has made several attempts to quit using nicotine patches and gum  she has consistently relapsed back into her smoking habits.  On examining her family history  her father suffered a myocardial infarction in his early 60s  and her older brother was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) in his late 50s.  Her physical examination revealed significant findings  include abnormal lower extremity pulse examination with weak dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses  skin color changes  and skin ulcers on her right foot  which are indicative of advanced PAD and critical limb ischemia.  In conclusion  Mrs. Thompson's primary risk factors contributing to her CLI include her long-standing diabetes  smoking history  uncontrolled hypertension  and high cholesterol levels  accentuated by her genetic predisposition. It is vital to formulate an aggressive treatment plan considering these factors to prevent limb loss and other serious complications.
7,1,98,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial98,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Anthony Davis  a 67-year-old African-American male  presents with critical limb ischemia. The patient has been experiencing severe pain in his left leg  which has exacerbated in the past couple of weeks. He has also noted noticeable changes in the color and temperature of the affected limb. In addition  he reports intermittent sores that are slow to heal.   The patient has a past medical history significant for atherosclerosis  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He is a former smoker with a 30-year pack history  although he has quit 5 years back. There is no history of any major surgical procedures and his immunizations are up to date. His current medications include atorvastatin  low-dose aspirin  and amlodipine.   Family history is remarkable with both his father and older brother having peripheral arterial disease  with his father having had a below-the-knee amputation due to complications of this condition. There is also a generational history of cardiovascular disease in his family  with several close relatives having heart attacks at relatively young ages. The patient is retired and lives alone in his house. He manages his daily activities independently but reports some difficulty in ambulating due to his current leg discomfort.   This combination of demographic details  personal habits  family history  and concomitant medical conditions puts Mr. Davis at an escalated risk for peripheral artery disease and its severe form - critical limb ischemia  which he now appears to be suffering from. He requires immediate diagnostic intervention for further evaluation and treatment planning.
7,1,99,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial99,Presentation of Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Demographic Information: The patient is a 70-year-old African American male named Mr. John Doe  living in New York  USA. He is married  retired  and lives with his wife. His primary language is English  and he is a non-smoker but has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. He is covered by Medicare and his income level is middle class.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe was diagnosed with type II Diabetes 10 years ago  which has been managed through insulin administration and other oral medications. He also suffers from hypertension for which he has been on medication for roughly 15 years. He suffered a Myocardial Infarction 5 years ago  which has escalated his cardiac health concern. Notably  he has a family history of cardiovascular diseases; both his father and paternal grandfather passed away from heart diseases in their late 60s.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Doe is presenting with symptoms consistent with Critical Limb Ischemia. These symptoms include severe pain in both legs  even while at rest  that has been worsening over the past few weeks. He also reports having ulcers on his feet that are not healing and a noticeable decrease in the temperature of his legs. He has experienced no trauma or injury to either of his lower extremities.  These symptoms have led to difficulties in performing daily activities and have compromised his quality of life. Considering his advanced age  history of diabetes  hypertension  heart attack  and a genetic predisposition to heart diseases  he is categorized as a high-risk patient.   An immediate and detailed assessment is crucial for Mr. Doe to prevent further deterioration and potential limb loss due to Critical Limb Ischemia. He is in need of a comprehensive treatment strategy that includes an aggressive plan to manage his diabetes  hypertension  and leg pain  along with potential surgical intervention.
7,1,100,diagnosis7-prompt1-trial100,Presentation of Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information:  Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe pain in his right lower limb. He lives in Greensboro  North Carolina  and was brought in by his daughter. His primary language is English and he is retired from a job in transportation. He is a non-smoker and denies alcohol or substance use.  Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a complex past medical history. Significant conditions include Type II diabetes which has been poorly controlled for the past ten years. He also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia which are controlled with medication. Interestingly  he was diagnosed with Peripheral Artery Disease about five years ago. His surgical history includes a coronary artery bypass graft for ischemic heart disease in the past.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presents with critical limb ischemia of his right lower extremity characterized by pain in the calf  which escalates at night and also during mild physical activities. He also reports intermittent claudication  progressively worsening over the past six months. This has significantly compromised his walking distance and overall mobility.  Physical Examination:  Physical examination revealed a significantly decreased temperature on his right lower extremity compared to left. Additionally  there was notable pallor upon elevation and peripheral cyanosis. Notably  his right foot was pale with reduced capillary refill (greater than 3 seconds) and weakened pedal and dorsalis pulses. There were early-stage ischemic ulcers on his toe and black discoloration suggesting gangrene development.   In conclusion  Mr. Doe is suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia which seems to have progressed significantly due to his past medical conditions  particularly his diabetes and peripheral artery disease. His condition is severe and requires immediate attention to prevent further complications like infection and possible amputation.
7,2,1,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial1,Patient Presentation  Mr. Antonio  a 73-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the clinic with complaints of intense  constant pain in his right lower limb  which is exacerbated when he is in a resting position. He reports that the pain has been progressing over the past two months while his foot has developed a noticeable discoloration  changing to a dark purplish color.   Upon examination  his right foot is cold to touch with diminished pulse strength. There also appears to be a non-healing wound on the ball of the foot which the patient reports has been present for the last three weeks.   He has a significant medical history  including Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which has been poorly controlled for the last 15 years. He also suffers from hypertension and Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)  diagnosed 10 years ago. The patient has been a heavy smoker for the past 50 years. His surgical history is non-significant. His medications include Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Aspirin for PAD.  Family history includes Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and myocardial infarction.   Given the patient's history and symptoms  Mr. Antonio is suspected to have Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Further diagnostic studies are recommended to confirm the diagnosis  evaluate the severity of the disease  and plan an appropriate therapeutic strategy.
7,2,2,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial2,Patient Presentation:  Mrs. Anita Castro  a 72-year-old Hispanic female  presents to the clinic today accompanied by her son. She has chronic pain in her left lower leg and foot  especially when at rest. She reports that the pain disrupts her sleep and has made mobility difficult. She also notes intermittent complaints of cold and pallor in the respective leg  and her son points out a non-healing ulcer on her left foot that has persisted for several weeks. On top of these  a noticeable limp can be observed as she walks.  Her past medical history includes a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  poorly controlled despite regular insulin therapy and dietary modifications. She also has a 30-year history of smoking 1 pack per day  though she quit 3 years ago. She also has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia and had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago  after which she was placed on multiple cardiac medications.  The patient lives alone  their diet is not always appropriate and she struggles with medication adherence; often because she forgets to take them. She has no known drug allergies. Her father passed away after a stroke and her mother had diabetes.  Given the chronicity of the symptoms  the long-standing history of uncontrolled diabetes and smoking  along with the presence of other risk factors  the clinical suspicion of critical limb ischemia is high and warrants immediate diagnostic workups.
7,2,3,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial3,Patient Presentation:  Patient:  Mr. Alberto Martinez  a 68-year-old male from Hispanic background  presents with complaints of severe  consistent pain in the left lower limb  particularly in the foot and calf region. The patient has a long-standing history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (over 20 years) with irregular blood sugar management. Past medical records also reflect high blood pressure (hypertension) and consequential damage to the kidneys (nephropathy). He was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 2 years back.  Symptoms:  Mr. Martinez complains of sharp  burning pain in the left foot  which increases at night causing disturbed sleep (rest pain). He reports foot sores and ulcers which heal slowly or not at all. The patient notes a diminished quality of life as the persistent pain forces him to reduce his daily activities. On probing further  the patient admits experiencing erectile issues lately  which he initially dismissed due to his age.  Physical Exam:  On physical examination  the left foot appears discolored (pallor). Palpation reveals an absence of pulsation in the left foot and lower peripheral region. Nonhealing ulcer observed on the ventral aspect of the left foot. Noticeable muscle atrophy observed on the left leg. Hair loss in the left foot and toe region is evident. There is no evidence of fever  and other vitals are within normal limits.  Relevant Past Medical History:  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (poorly controlled) - Hypertension - Nephropathy - Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) - History of smoking and alcohol use - Dyslipidemia (high levels of low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides and a low level of high-density lipoprotein) - Obesity (BMI: 33)    This consistent symptomatology and medical history reveal a presentation of critical limb ischemia. Referral to a vascular specialist  immediate intervention  and stringent glycemic control would be the next steps to avoid amputation and improving quality of life.
7,2,4,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial4,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Smith  a 75-year-old African American male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 50-pack-year history of smoking  presents with a chief complaint of rest pain in his left lower extremity. He reports this pain is particularly worse at night  forcing him to hang his foot over the side of the bed for relief  and describes it as a constant  severe  burning sensation. He also notes a non-healing ulcer on his left big toe with associated discoloration of the toe. Further  he reveals that the pain eventually wakes him up at night and is relieved only by walking around his room.   Upon physical examination  his left lower extremity is found to be colder compared to the other leg. The limb is pale in appearance  sparse hair  brittle nails  and the capillary refill time (CRT) is significantly delayed. The left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are barely palpable.   Relevant past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension on medication  active nicotine dependence  poorly controlled diabetes with retinopathy and neuropathy  and hyperlipidemia. Mr. Smith has undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery five years ago. He has no history of stroke  kidney disease  or claudication. He does not consume alcohol and lives alone. His medications include insulin  metformin  an ACE inhibitor  a beta-blocker  a statin  and aspirin. 
7,2,5,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial5,Patient Presentation:  A 75-year-old African-American male  Mr. AD  presents an abrupt onset severe resting pain in his right lower extremity  which dramatically worsens at night. As a retired steel worker  he has a history of long-term heavy smoking  about two packs a day for the past 50 years  and also had poorly controlled type-2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 15 years ago and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosed around five years ago.   His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases - both his father and elder brothers died from myocardial infarctions. The patient does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He's been gradually losing weight for the past few months and also noticed that his right foot is constantly cold and its skin looks pale.  Physical examination showed an ulcer on the dorsal aspect of the right foot near the big toe  having a diameter of about 2 cm with gangrenous changes. Palpation of the right lower limb reveals no palpable pulses. The Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) is significantly decreased to 0.4 on the right side  while it is 0.9 on the left side.  The patient is on metformin along with antihypertensive drugs  statin and anti-platelet agent for his past medical conditions. He adheres to his medication regimen  but struggles with diabetes control and cessation of smoking. The patient lives with his wife  who is his primary caregiver. He expresses severe distress about the possibility of amputation.   Given the above findings  critical limb ischemia is suspected.
7,2,6,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial6,Patient Presentation:  A 67-year-old female  Mrs. Smith  currently a retired nurse  presents to the clinic with complaints of persistent  excruciating pain in her right lower leg which she describes as a deep-seated ache intensified at rest. The pain has been disrupting her sleep for the past two weeks. She also reports experiencing intermittent claudication or discomfort with walking  but these episodes have been progressively worsening over the past 6 months. She noted the appearance of non-healing sores on her right foot two weeks ago. On inspection  the skin of the affected leg appeared pale  and pulses were weak. Further examination revealed a small  ulcerated wound on the dorsal aspect of the foot.  Relevant Past Medical History:  Mrs. Smith shared a past medical history significant for 15 years of type-2 diabetes mellitus  which is somewhat controlled through oral hypoglycemic medications. She also has been diagnosed with high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels over the past 10 years  managed by anti-hypertensives and statins respectively. Mrs. Smith is a former smoker with a 20 pack-year history who quit about a year ago after experiencing a minor myocardial infarction.
7,2,7,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial7,Patient Presentation:  John Doe  a 72-year-old African-American male with a past medical history significant for poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and tobacco use presented to the ED with severe pain in his right lower extremity. The patient reports that the pain is a sharp  9/10 intensity pain that is constant and non-radiating. Motor and sensory function are impacted distal to the knee  and he describes the foot as feeling “cold and numb.” This has been a chronic issue but has drastically worsened over the past week. He mentioned recent non-healing ulcers on his right foot and noted that he has lost weight unintentionally over the past few weeks.  Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and generalized fatigue. Pain is unrelieved with over-the-counter medications and is associated with decreased sleep. He denies fever  chills  recent trauma  chest pain  or shortness of breath. The patient has intermittent claudication with pain upon minimal exertion which subsides with rest.  On examination  the right lower limb is noticeably cooler compared to the left. Capillary refill time is prolonged at over 5 seconds in the right foot compared to under 3 seconds in the left foot. No palpable pulses are detected in the right popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial regions. The right foot is pale and dry skin with multiple sores that are slow to heal. There is no noticeable edema  but atrophy of the muscles of the right leg distal to the knee is observed. There are tobacco stains on his fingers and his breath smells of tobacco.  On obtaining the patient's social history  the patient mentioned he smoked 1 pack of tobacco daily for the past 50 years  he consumes alcohol on social occasions  and he is non-compliant with medications for his diabetes. There is no familial history of peripheral vascular disease or similar symptoms. 
7,2,8,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial8,Patient Presentation:  Patient is an 80-year-old African American male with a history of uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  chronic kidney disease on dialysis  and a previous history of smoking with 20 pack years. He presents to the emergency room with worsening rest pain in his right lower extremity  primarily in his foot  for the past week. Pain is described as a sharp  constant 8/10 pain which worsens at night and when he elevates his leg  alleviated somewhat by dangling the leg off the bed. Accompanied by a noticeable change in skin color - from normal to pale and mottled  loss of hair on the affected leg  and delayed healing of injuries on the limb. The patient reports having a small foot ulcer on the big toe two weeks ago  which seems to be not getting better. He also reports weakness and fatigue but denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or constitutional symptoms.       Relevant Past Medical History: 1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (uncontrolled) 2. Hypertension (poorly controlled) 3. 20 Pack Years Smoking History 4. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 on Hemodialysis 5. Previous Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) diagnosis for which patient was non-compliant with medications and lifestyle modifications.                    6. No known allergies to medication.
7,2,9,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial9,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Thompson  a 65-year-old African-American male  presents to the emergency department complaining of severe  constant pain in his right lower leg which started about 2 days ago. The patient reports that the pain is present even while at rest  and he describes it as a burning and cramping sensation. He also notes the presence of a non-healing wound on the foot of the same leg. He finds certain relief when he hangs the leg off the edge of the bed.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thompson has a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both of which are currently managed with medication. He has smoked approximately 1 pack per day for 40 years and his lifestyle includes a sedentary job and minimal exercise.  On examination  the patient's right lower leg appears pale and colder than the left  and there are marked diminution of the pulses distally in the right leg  along with an ulcer on the foot. The ankle brachial index (ABI) is 0.4 on the right leg  signaling severe peripheral arterial disease.  The findings are suggestive of critical limb ischemia  likely secondary to his long-standing smoking habit and poorly controlled diabetes.
7,2,10,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial10,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Donald  a 68-year-old African-American male  presented to the emergency department complaining of persistent severe pain in his left lower limb  particularly in the calf area. Pain increased over the past two weeks  now disturbing his sleep. Widowed  lives alone  retired engineer  non-smoker  occasional alcohol consumer  denied drug use.  The pain is 8/10 on the numeric rating scale  intermittent in nature  worse at night  and slightly relieved with analgesics. He also noticed a non-healing ulcer on his left foot which appeared three weeks ago. He complains of coldness in his foot and intermittent numbness.   Vital signs at presentation were blood pressure 140/90 mmHg  pulse 80/min  respiratory rate 18/min  temperature 36.7℃  and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On examination  his left foot was noticeably cooler than the right one  with delayed capillary refill. A small ulcer (~1 cm in diameter) was observed on the lateral aspect of the left foot with surrounding erythema.  Past medical history is significant for hypertension  type 2 diabetes managed with Metformin for the past ten years  hyperlipidemia  and previous myocardial infarction two years ago. Medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin. He also reported undergoing angioplasty following the myocardial infarction but has no known allergies. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having passed away from a heart attack and his mother from a stroke.   This clinical scenario with history and examination findings is suggestive of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) of the left lower extremity.
7,2,11,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial11,Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old male patient  Mr. Smith  comes to the clinic. He is a Caucasian man with a history of type-2 diabetes that was diagnosed 10 years ago and has been poorly controlled. He has been a smoker for the past 30 years. His body mass index is 29  indicating obesity. He reports experiencing chronic pain in his left foot  even at rest  over the past few weeks. The pain is severe enough to interrupt his sleep at night. He reports no known allergies.  On physical examination  his left foot is cooler than the right one  with marked pallor  diminished pedal pulses  and slow capillary refill. There are signs of tissue loss with an ulcer on the dorsal aspect and thickened toenails  suggesting a lack of circulation and poor wound healing.   He admits to skipping his diabetes medication regimens at times due to difficulty affording his medication. He is currently on metformin for diabetes  an aspirin a day for heart disease prevention  and a statin for hyperlipidemia. His family history is significant for heart disease  with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction at age 56.   This presentation strongly suggests critical limb ischemia  likely secondary to peripheral arterial disease  compounded by his diabetes and smoking.
7,2,12,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial12,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old African-American male named Mr. Johnson who presents with severe  recurrent pain in his right foot more in the toe regions that is unrelieved at rest. Mr. Johnson reports the pain as sharp and constant  and characterizes it as a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10 which gets more intense during night making him rise from sleep. The pain has been present for the last six months and is progressively getting worse. He also reports non-healing ulcers or sores on the toes of his right foot which showed color changes and atrophy. Upon physical examination  his right foot is cold to touch  with diminished pulses and pale skin.  Mr. Johnson has a history of type 2 diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago and hypertension diagnosed five years ago. He has been adherent to his medications for both conditions. He is a former smoker with a 20 pack-year smoking history  but quit about a year ago. He had a heart attack seven years ago  for which he underwent angioplasty. Mr. Johnson leads a sedentary lifestyle and his diet usually consists of high-carbohydrate  high-fat foods.   Due to his history of diabetes and heart disease with presence of peripheral artery disease symptoms  there is high suspicion that Mr. Johnson could be having critical limb ischemia  warranting immediate investigation and intervention.
7,2,13,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial13,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James  a 75-year-old African-American male  presents to the emergency department with excruciating pain in his left leg  which he notes has been progressively worsening over the last couple of weeks. The pain initially commenced while he was walking but now persists even at rest  primarily at night. He also complains of occasional numbness and cold sensation in his left foot. His sleep is severely disturbed due to the pain.   On physical examination  there are noticeable sores on the left foot which are not healing as expected. Pulses  notably the pedal pulse  are absent in the same extremity. His left leg is paler compared to the right leg.   Relevant past medical history includes hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years  dyslipidemia  and a 40-pack-year history of smoking. He also had a previous myocardial infarction 5 years back which was managed with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. The patient is currently on multiple medications including Metformin  Lisinopril  Atorvastatin  and Aspirin.  He is a retired engineer  living with his wife in their own house. His wife notes that he has been steadily decreasing his activities due to his leg pain. She also shares concern regarding his poor dietary habits and irregular management of his diabetes.
7,2,14,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial14,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented himself to the emergency department with severe pain in his left lower leg. The pain which is especially noticeable at rest  had been ongoing for several weeks and has been progressively worsening. He describes the pain as nagging and constant  which often intensifies at night  disturbing his sleep.   Upon physical examination  his left foot appears slightly pale and cooler compared to the right one. Mr. Johnson also reports having noticed slowly healing sores on the same foot.   His medical history is notable for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years  though he claims reduced frequency now  and life-long sedentary lifestyle. There is also a history of coronary artery disease  for which he underwent angioplasty 5 years ago. Family history reveals both his father and grandfather had peripheral artery disease.   The patient's pertinent medications include oral hypoglycemics for diabetes  anti-hypertensives  statin therapy for hyperlipidemia  and a daily aspirin.   Given the chief complaint of rest pain alongside slowly healing sores and significant past medical history  a high suspicion for critical limb ischemia (CLI) was raised. The patient's long-term smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  and hypertension put him at high risk for developing CLI. Further investigations were subsequently arranged for definitive diagnosis and appropriate management.
7,2,15,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial15,Patient Presentation  Mrs. Gonzalez is a 72-year-old Hispanic female presenting to the outpatient clinic with a 3-week history of worsening right leg pain  which has significantly intensified over the last 2 days. She describes the pain as severe  constant  non-radiating  and is most notable at rest  especially at night. Mrs. Gonzalez reports that the pain is rated as an 8 on a 10-point scale. She reports accompanying numbness and coldness in her right foot  with observable color change to bluish-grey. The patient expresses concern about difficulty in sleeping and walking due to the pain.  She has a long-standing history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She has been a heavy smoker for the past 50 years  averaging about 10-15 cigarettes per day. Her medications include Metformin 1000mg twice daily  Lisinopril 20mg daily  and Simvastatin 40mg at bedtime. Her surgical history is significant for a cholecystectomy 10 years ago. She denies any known drug allergies.   Upon examination  the right lower extremity was noted to be cool to touch with weak peripheral pulses. There are non-healing ulcers on the heel and distal toes of the right foot. Her left lower extremity appears normal.  Given the patient’s symptoms  her prolonged smoking history  and poorly managed diabetes  the current presentation is highly suggestive of critical limb ischemia pending further diagnostics.
7,2,16,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial16,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Franklin is a 72-year-old African-American male patient who presents to the emergency department with severe  unrelenting pain in his left lower extremity extending from his hip to his calf. The pain has been gradual in onset but has become progressively worse over the last two weeks. He states the pain is most intense at night and has been interfering with his sleep.  Mr. Franklin has a 50 pack-year smoking history and has been a chronic alcohol user for several decades. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 8 years ago  which is poorly controlled  with recent Hemoglobin A1c levels around 9.8%. He also has a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnosed 2 years ago  hypertension  and high cholesterol levels  both of which are controlled with medication.  On visual examination  Mr. Franklin's left foot appears pale when elevated and red when hanging down. His left foot is cold upon touch and has a weak dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis artery pulse. He has not noted any recent trauma to the lower extremity. Upon neurological examination  the sensory functions of the foot are diminished.   He experiences pain while walking short distances (less than 100 meters) and has an ulcer on the bunion of his left foot that has not healed despite treatment.  Considering his history of smoking  alcoholism  uncontrolled diabetes  PAD and the physical symptoms  there is a high suspicion of critical limb ischemia. Further diagnostic testing  such as an ankle-brachial index (ABI)  Doppler ultrasound and/or angiogram would be recommended.
7,2,17,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial17,Patient Presentation:  The patient is an 80-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Johnson who resides in a local assisted living community. He presents to the emergency department complaining of increasingly unbearable pain in his right lower leg  which he says began several weeks ago. He initially experienced cramping during physical activity  then it progressed to pain at rest  especially at night. Over the past few days  his foot also started feeling cold  and he noticed a bluish discoloration.  Past Medical History (PMH):  Mr. Johnson has a long-standing history of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which is poorly controlled  complicated by peripheral neuropathy. He reports a smoking history of 40 pack-years but quit ten years ago. His other medical history includes hypertension and previous myocardial infarction. His medications include Metformin for Diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension.  He underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery approximately 5 years ago. His family history is notable for heart disease and stroke. He had no known drug allergies. Physical examination reported reduced distal pulses in his right lower extremity along with bluish discoloration. He has a non-healing ulcer on his right big toe. With this history and physical examination  he is suspected to have critical limb ischemia.
7,2,18,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial18,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 65-year-old African American male  presenting with complaints of non-healing sores on his left foot  particularly the big toe  and severe pain in his left calf when walking for more than five minutes. The pain usually resolves with rest but has become increasingly frequent. This has significantly affected his mobility for the last several weeks.  John is a retired truck driver  lives with his wife  and is a 20-pack-year smoker.  He has a medical history significant for Type-2 diabetes mellitus  managed with Metformin  Hypertension managed with Amlodipine and Lisinopril  and hypercholesterolemia controlled with Atorvastatin.

The skin of the right lower limb is cool to touch  with noticeable hair loss and shiny appearance. On examination  the right foot dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are absent. A non-healing ulcer with evidence of necrosis was noted on the right great toe.
7,2,21,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial21,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 68-year-old African American male presenting to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe rest pain in his left lower extremity. The pain has been persistent for the past 2 weeks  growing increasingly severe  and causing the patient to lose sleep. He also notes a non-healing wound on his left heel that he noticed approximately one month ago. He denies fever  chills  or other systemic symptoms.  Past Medical History:  His medical history is notable for poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 40-pack year smoking history. He had a myocardial infarction requiring stent placement three years ago. Unfortunately  he has not been able to maintain compliance with his medication regimen due to financial issues.  On physical examination  his left foot is cold to touch  with decreased sensation and weak distal pulses. There is a 2 cm ulcer over the left heel with surrounding erythema  but no signs of active infection. The right lower extremity is warm with normal pulses. An Ankle-Brachial index is performed yielding a result of 0.4 on the left  indicative of severe peripheral artery disease.  With these findings  the patient is suspected of having critical limb ischemia and is referred for urgent vascular surgery consultation. Intervention is vital to prevent limb loss.
7,2,22,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial22,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Smith is a 75-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the emergency department with signs indicative of critical limb ischemia in his left lower extremity.   History:   He complains of rest pain in his left leg  especially notable at night  causing him to have disturbed sleep. He states that even when at rest and elevated  the pain doesn't subside and has noticed a steady increase in severity over the past three months. He reports intermittent claudication initially  but it evolved into continuous pain recently. He also reports some non-healing sores on the lower part of his leg.  Past Medical History:  He has a significant medical history of uncontrolled Type II Diabetes Mellitus for around ten years  hypertension for 15 years  and Coronary Artery Disease for which he had a bypass surgery seven years ago. He is on daily oral hypoglycemics  antihypertensive medications  aspirin  and a statin.   His lifestyle history revealed that he is a former smoker who quit smoking five years ago after being diagnosed with emphysema  a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is not an alcohol consumer and denies illicit drug use. He also denies any known allergies to food or drugs.   He is retired and lives with his wife. Family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction in his sixties. The patient is concerned about the increasing pain and the sores not healing despite local care.
7,2,23,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial23,Patient Profile: Ms. Jenkins is a 70-year-old African-American female presenting to the emergency department with severe leg pain at rest  non-healing foot ulcers  and noted discoloration on her lower extremities indicative of critical limb ischemia (CLI).   Complaint: She reports the pain in both legs has been ongoing for approximately two months but has recently increased in severity. The pain increases at night and is mildly relieved when she dangles her feet off the side of her bed. She also reports significant weight loss over the last few months  likely secondary to loss of appetite and general malaise.  Past Medical History: Her past medical history is notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  peripheral artery disease  and hyperlipidemia. She previously smoked a pack of cigarettes a day but quit 5 years ago. She has had no previous surgeries or hospitalizations.  Family History: No family history of similar symptoms have been noted  but her mother had a heart attack at the age of 75.  Current Medications: She is currently on metformin for her diabetes  lisinopril for her hypertension  a statin for her hyperlipidemia and aspirin as prophylaxis for her peripheral artery disease.  Physical Examination: On exam  she appears frail and in distress. She has bilateral foot ulcers with noticeable gangrene on her right foot. There are notable areas of skin discoloration and thinning. Both of her lower limbs are cold to the touch. Her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are both absent bilaterally.  This presentation is representative of a patient experiencing significant complications from multiple modifiable risk factors. Her diagnosis of diabetes and hypertension  along with her history of tobacco use  has likely contributed to the progression of her peripheral artery disease  resulting in critical limb ischemia.
7,2,24,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial24,Patient Information: Mr. Rodriguez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  presenting with severe  unbearable pain in the right lower extremity  at rest  mainly in the foot  for the last four days. The issue started about 6 months ago with initial pain while walking  which resolved with rest (indicating intermittent claudication). However  the pain has now become persistent and is causing sleep disturbances. Reports increased sensitivity to cold and noticed a blueish discoloration of the toes and says the foot feels numb and tingly.  Past Medical History: He has a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years and hypertension for 10 years. Records show suboptimal control of both conditions over the last 5 years. There's also a recent diagnosis (1 year ago) of peripheral arterial disease  with non-compliance to prescribed medications.  Social History: He is a retired accountant  lives with his wife  and has a 40-pack yearly smoking history. He stopped drinking alcohol two years ago. His diet mainly consists of fried foods and meat with moderate physical activity.  Family History: A strong family history of cardiac diseases  his father died of a heart attack and his older brother has undergone a coronary angioplasty. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus.   Clinical Examination: The right foot shows a cold touch with dry  scaly skin. There are a few non-healing ulcers present on toes and the heel with diminished pedal pulses. Doppler examination revealed significantly reduced ankle-brachial index. Absence of hair growth was noted along with bluish hue to the right foot. The left foot has normal perfusion and sensation.  The patient exhibits signs of anxiety and distress  secondary to the chronic intense pain. He is also concerned about the possibility of losing his leg. These symptoms are consistent with a presentation of critical limb ischemia.
7,2,25,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial25,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnathon Wilson is a 74-year-old African American male  presenting with complaints of severe rest pain in his left lower limb  primarily located in the foot. He reports that the pain intensifies at night and sometimes eases when he lets his foot hang off the bed. A nearby family member also informed of the existence of non-healing ulcers on his left foot toes.  Mr. Wilson has a past medical history notable for chronic hypertension for the past two decades and diabetes mellitus diagnosed 12 years ago  for both of which he has been on medication. The patient also has been a heavy smoker (1 pack per day) for the past 50 years. He has undergone treatment for a myocardial infarction (MI) 3 years ago. Examination of his left lower limb revealed pallor  cooler to touch with feeble pulses  and non-healing ulcers. Previous ankle-brachial index (ABI) of the affected limb has been reported as less than 0.4  indicating severe limb ischemia.   In the current presentation  his pain has not subsided despite maximum dosage of pain-relievers. Given his clinical picture  there is a suspicion of critical limb ischemia  impending risk of limb loss  and needs immediate attention.
7,2,26,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial26,Patient Presentation:  A 67-year-old African American male patient  retired truck driver  presents to the clinic with severe pain in his right lower leg that has worsened within the last few weeks. He describes a burning pain that is persistent even at rest. The patient reveals that he had to start sleeping with his leg hanging over the side of the bed as this position somewhat alleviates the pain. He also mentions having noticed a non-healing wound on his right foot. It first appeared as a minor cut after accidentally hitting his foot on a kitchen table three weeks ago but has since increased in size despite using over-the-counter medication.   Past Medical History:  He is a former smoker  quitting five years ago but had a forty year pack history prior to quitting. He has a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past ten years  which he monitors with Metformin but admits to poor dietary compliance. He also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with lisinopril and atorvastatin  respectively. His father suffered a heart attack at the age of 64.   The patient denies any chest pain  palpitations  dizziness  dyspnea or cough. On physical examination  the right lower limb is colder compared to the left which is normal  with delayed capillary refill. The pulses are weak on the right side compared to the left side. Motor and sensory functions are intact in both limbs. Overall  the patient’s presentation is highly suggestive of critical limb ischemia with possible underlying peripheral artery disease (PAD).
7,2,27,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial27,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Antonio Hernandez  a 72-year-old Hispanic male  presents to the clinic today with painful blue-black discoloration of his right foot which has been progressive over the past 8-10 days. He also reports intermittent claudication on walking more than 50 yards. Mr. Hernandez also has a history of numbness and rest pain in the same foot at bedtime for more than two months.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Hernandez was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus 25 years ago and had been managing it with metformin  intermittent insulin use  and dietary measures. He also has a history of persistent smoking (30-pack-year history). He has been hypertensive for more than 10 years and takes Losartan for it. His last recorded blood pressure in the clinic was 150/95 mm Hg. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and isophane insulin. Around six years ago  he was diagnosed with Stable Angina and was managed conservatively with medications. His family history is noteworthy- his father died of myocardial infarction and his mother had a cerebrovascular accident.  Surgical History:  Mr. Hernandez underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twelve years ago  and cholecystectomy due to gallstone disease around ten years ago. He had poor wound healing after CABG with a prolonged recovery period.   Summary:  Given the history of intermittent claudication  rest pain  and progressive changes in skin color  along with substantial history of diabetes  hypertension and hyperlipidemia  and smoking  the likely diagnosis is critical limb ischemia  potentially resulting from peripheral arterial disease.
7,2,28,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial28,Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old Caucasian male patient  Mr. Johnson  came to the emergency department complaining of severe  persistent pain in the right lower leg  which intensifies at night or when the leg is elevated. Pain has been present for the last 15-16 days and is unresponsive to over-the-counter analgesics. His right foot is noticeably colder than the left one  with delayed capillary refill and a faint pulse. He also noticed a small non-healing ulcer on the dorsal aspect of his right foot.  The patient is a long-standing hypertensive with poor adherence to medication for the past 30 years  and a history of 20 pack-years of smoking but quit five years ago. He had also been diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus ten years ago which is on oral hypoglycemic agents. He is not aware of any history of cardiovascular or any other chronic diseases in his family but his father  2 brothers  and 1 sister were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. The patient is a retired engineer  lives with his wife  and occasionally consumes alcohol.  Physical examination reveals that both his feet are pale  the right foot being more so. His blood pressure is 190/110 mmHg. His pulses were diminished in the right femoral  popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial arteries.  From his medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  long-standing smoking habit  poorly controlled diabetes  and the resultant peripheral arterial disease  the patient may be presenting with critical limb ischemia. He needs immediate intervention to save his limb and reduce his risk of significant morbidity and mortality.
7,2,29,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial29,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department reporting severe pain in his left lower leg. He describes the pain as continuous and unrelenting  even when he rests. He states the pain has increased over the last two weeks. Additionally  he reports noticing that his foot is a darker color than it used to be and his toes look bluish.  He is a non-smoker and abstains from alcohol but has a significant medical history of type 2 diabetes which he has had for the last 15 years  poorly controlled hypertension  and high cholesterol. In addition  there was an incident 3 years ago where he underwent angioplasty for a heart attack. Mr. Smith states that he is on metformin for his diabetes  a statin for his cholesterol  and an ACE inhibitor for his hypertension.  Furthermore  he reports that he has had difficulty with walking because of leg pain for the past few years  but it has never been as intense as the current pain. He has also observed that he has lost weight over the last few weeks due to decreased appetite. His family history is also significant for cardiovascular diseases with his father having passed away from a stroke.  Upon physical examination  his left foot is cold compared to the right foot  the peripheral pulses of the left foot are weak and there are non-healing ulcers on the distal aspect of his foot. No signs of infection are present in the area. Data from an Ankle-brachial index (ABI) indicates significantly reduced blood flow to his left lower extremity.  Based on this information  Mr. Smith is suspected of having critical limb ischemia  specifically in his left lower limb. A recommendation is made for an urgent angiogram to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the possibility of surgical revascularization or angioplasty. He is educated about the importance of tight glucose and blood pressure control and is made to understand that failure to treat could result in possible amputation of his limb.
7,2,30,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial30,Patient Presentation: Mr. Williams is a 66-year-old Caucasian male  known to have a 15-year history of uncontrolled type-2 diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). He also has a history of cardiovascular disease with myocardial infarction three years ago. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years. He comes in today complaining of increasing pain in his left lower limb over the past six weeks. He describes the pain as severe  burning  and constant  even during rest  especially at night. He also states that he had noticed a non-healing ulcer on the dorsum of his left foot and discoloration of his toes. On further probing  he reports he has suffered from intermittent claudication for several years  with walking distance becoming shorter of late. He denies any fever or chills  but does confirm a significant loss of weight and appetite. He lives alone  is retired  and is not very active  using a cane to move around his home due to his significant leg pain. He admits adherence to medication  including aspirin and statins  has been suboptimal. On examination  the left foot is found to be cooler than the right  with a non-healing ulcer on the dorsum and mottled discoloration of the toes. There are absent pulses distal to the femoral artery on the left side. His right lower limb shows adequate perfusion and intact pulses.
7,2,31,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial31,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith is a 68-year-old African American male who presents to the vascular outpatient clinic with non-healing ulcers on his left foot for the past 6 weeks. In addition to the ulcers  he reports resting pain in the lower portion of his leg  usually at night. The pain often interrupts his sleep compelling him to hang the leg over the edge of the bed to attain relief.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a long-standing history of poorly controlled diabetes for 30 years and hypertension for 25 years. He also has a 45 pack-year history of smoking but quit 2 years ago. He had a previous myocardial infarction 4 years ago and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention at that time. Stents were placed in the left anterior descending artery. Mr. Smith also had a stroke approximately one year ago with minor residual right-sided weakness.   Currently  he is on metformin  lisinopril  amlodipine  aspirin  and atorvastatin. He has noticed significant weight loss in the past couple of months  although unintentional.  Family History:  His father had peripheral artery disease and underwent amputation. His mother died at a young age due to a stroke. He also had a brother who had a heart attack and died at the age of 52.  Social History:  Mr. Smith is a retired Truck Driver  lives alone and is able to perform his activities of daily living independently. He is a widower with 3 grown-up children who live out of state. He denies any alcohol use but admits to a strong smoking history.  On physical examination:  Significant findings include delayed capillary refill time  atrophic skin changes  weak or non-palpable pulses  presence of ulcers and significant hair loss on the lower extremities. There are no signs of acute inflammation  and the ulcers are clean with no signs of infection. The remainder of the physical examination is basically unremarkable. He appears older than his stated age and seems markedly cachexic. He uses a cane for walking due to right-sided weakness post-stroke. He has no other complaints.
7,2,32,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial32,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Riley  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with severe pain in his left lower extremity. He reported a three-week history of progressive  excruciating  rest pain in the foot that worsens at night. He also noted the presence of non-healing ulcers on his left heel and great toe.   Mr. Riley is a long-term smoker  averaging about one pack a day for 50 years. He reports a previous history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was previously diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease two years ago but has not been regular with his medications or follow-up visits. He has no known allergies. His father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 70  and his mother had a stroke at the age of 75.  On physical examination  the left foot was pale with a noticeable temperature difference compared to the right foot. The foot pulses were not palpable  and the ankle-brachial index on the left was 0.39. Non-invasive vascular labs confirmed the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.   Mr. Riley reports being adherent with his antihypertensive medication but irregular with medication for diabetes and peripheral arterial disease. He admits to a poor diet and lack of exercise due to chronic leg pain and shortness of breath due to smoking.   The patient's economic status is low  with limited access to health resources as he lives in a rural area. He has a high school education and worked as a mechanic before retirement. He lives alone since his wife died five years ago.  Social support is minimal due to estrangement from his two adult sons.   Given the findings of risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  hyperglycemia  and a previous perivascular disease  Mr. Riley's condition is alarmingly consistent with late-stage critical limb ischemia.
7,2,33,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial33,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Roberts  a 72-year-old African American male  presents with chronic foot pain at rest that has progressively worsened over the last month. He says his feet often feel cold and numb  and he's noticed that a sore on his right foot isn't healing. He describes an intermittent claudication  stating that he is unable to walk more than 50 yards without experiencing severe leg cramps. He admits to feeling weak and notes unexplained weight loss.  Relevant Past Medical History:  Mr. Roberts has a long-standing history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which is poorly controlled despite being on Metformin. He is also a former smoker with a 50-pack year history  and continues tobacco use in the form of smokeless tobacco. He has Hypertension  for which he takes Lisinopril  and Hyperlipidemia  which is managed by Atorvastatin.

He also suffered from a myocardial infarction 10 years prior for which he underwent CABG. The patient also reports a history of hyperlipidemia.   His lifestyle includes a sedentary routine with little physical activity  and a diet high in fats. He has been advised to quit smoking and take up exercise several times but acknowledges non-compliance  stating that he has not been able to make these lifestyle modifications. His BMI indicates that he also suffers from obesity.   Family history is significant for diabetes in his mother and coronary artery disease in his father. The patient is a widower and lives alone. He is retired from a desk job and is financially stable.
7,2,37,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial37,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Clarke  a 75-year-old Hispanic male from Miami  Florida  presents to the emergency department with a complaint of severe pain in his left leg  which he's been experiencing for the last four weeks. The pain has gradually become so intense that it now disturbs his sleep and has led to a progressive loss of colour in the foot. Mr. Clarke also reports the presence of a non-healing ulcer on his left heel and difficulty walking due to pain.  John is retired and lives with his wife. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history  has been treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past ten years  and has a history of type 2 diabetes managed with oral medications. He was also diagnosed with peripheral artery disease five years ago. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  including his father  who died due to a heart attack at the age of 68.  On examination  his left foot appears to be pale and cool to touch  with absent pulses below the knee. The mentioned ulcer is about 2 cm in diameter  with necrotic tissue at its center. His right leg appears to be normal  with palpable pulses and no skin changes. Remainder of his examination is largely unremarkable.  Based on his history  clinical presentation and physical examination  a preliminary diagnosis of critical limb ischemia in his left leg is made. 
7,2,38,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial38,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Anderson is a 68-year-old Caucasian male presenting with severe rest pain in his left lower extremity. The pain  concentrated in his calf and foot  is consistently present but intensifies when he lays down. He mentions it often wakes him at night if his foot is not hanging from the side of the bed. Mr. Anderson reports a significant history of a 25-year  pack-a-day smoking habit  which he quit 5 years ago.   Additionally  Mr. Anderson has a notable history of uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension  for which he is currently taking prescribed medications. His peripheral pulses are weak in comparison with his right leg  and he has visible trophic changes in his left foot  such as hair loss and shiny skin. There is also a non-healing ulcer on the heel.   He has no known family history of peripheral artery disease but has a father and brother with heart diseases. Referring to his occupation  Mr. Anderson used to work as a plumber but has been retired for about 4 years now.  On reviewing his previous medical reports  Mr. Anderson was hospitalized for a myocardial infarction around 3 years ago. He hasn't undergone any surgeries in the past. There's no history of allergy to any drugs or foods. However  he is potentially non-compliant with his diabetic medications. His BMI is 32  indicating obesity.  Clinically  these symptoms seem indicative of critical limb ischemia on the left side  likely due to his uncontrolled diabetes and history of smoking. Further diagnostic investigation is required to confirm.
7,2,39,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial39,Patient Information:   A 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired Army officer  presenting to the Emergency Department. He resides in an assisted living facility.  Chief Complaint:   Severe pain in the right lower limb for the past 3 days  not improving with over-the-counter painkillers.  History of Present Illness:   The patient describes the pain as a constant  burning sensation that stands at an intensity of 8/10. The pain is worst in the foot but diffuses up to the calf. He mentions that the pain sometimes lessens with limb elevation but amplifies during walks or other forms of exertion. He also reports that the foot appears paler than the left one and feels cold to touch.  Past Medical History:   He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (on insulin) for the past 20 years  hypertension for the last 30 years  and an ischemic heart disease with an episode of myocardial infarction 10 years ago. He was a two-pack-per-day smoker for 50+ years but quit 5 years ago.  Drug History:   The patient is currently on regular treatment with Insulin  Metoprolol  Clopidogrel  and Lisinopril.  Review of Systems:  Distinctive symptoms of rest pain  non-healing sores  and coldness of the lower limb.  Physical Examination:   On examination  the patient's right foot shows pallor and mottling. A non-healing  shallow ulcer is seen on the tip of the right big toe with slight gangrene. Distal pulses (Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial) are markedly weakened on the right side.  These clinical presentations hint towards critical limb ischemia in the patient  and proper diagnostic and management procedures need to be initiated at the earliest to prevent further complications.
7,2,40,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial40,Patient Presentation:  A 70-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with severe pain in his left lower extremity  which had been escalating in intensity over the past 48 hours. He also reported progressive numbness and discoloration of his left foot  along with an open  non-healing wound on his left big toe.  The patient’s past medical history is significant for a 30-year history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus  as well as hyperlipidemia and a 50-pack year smoking history. He had a prior toe amputation on the right foot approximately 2 years ago due to a similar  non-healing wound.   On physical examination  there was notable pallor  decreased temperature  and absence of pulsation on the dorsalis pedis and the posterior tibial arteries of the left foot. Sensation was significantly diminished in the left foot compared to the right. The open toe wound was noted to be blackened at the edges  with necrotic tissue visible and no signs of active bleeding.  The patient was immediately referred to vascular surgery due to concerns about possible critical limb ischemia.
7,2,41,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial41,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 68-year-old African-American male  presents to the outpatient department with a chief complaint of excruciating pain in his lower left leg that has been intensifying over the last few months. The pain now interferes with his daily activities and often wakes him up at night. He also reports a non-healing wound on his left foot that has been present for a couple of weeks. On further questioning  the patient admits to occasional swelling of the lower limb and a subtle change in the color of his left foot. He denies any recent trauma or injury to both his legs.  Past Medical History:  He is a known case of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 15 years with poor glycaemic control. He also has a long history of hypertension and is being treated with antihypertensive medication. The patient is a long-term smoker  with a history of more than 30 years of tobacco use. The patient also has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) a year ago but has been non-compliant with his medication and follow-up visits. Mr. Johnson also has a relevant familial history  as his father had a history of coronary artery disease and stroke.  Social History:  He lives alone as a retiree  is a widower with no children. He has been reliant on his daily stipend for food and medication  which might have contributed to poor medication compliance. He admits to consuming alcohol moderately. He does not engage in physical exercise frequently due to chronic pain.
7,2,42,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial42,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Gonzalez is a 75-year-old Latina woman known to have a 20+ year history of poorly controlled type II diabetes and peripheral vascular disease. She has had no previous surgeries or interventions. Ms. Gonzalez has not seen a physician in several years due to financial constraints and has been managing her sugar levels and overall health as best as she can on her own.  Ms. Gonzalez presents today with a complaint of severe pain in her right lower leg  which she reports has been steadily worsening over the past three months. The pain is constantly present  even at rest  and most intense in her foot and calf. She has noticed some color changes to her lower leg particularly turning dark purple when it is in a dependent position. She reports trouble sleeping due to the pain and has noted an open sore on her foot that has not been healing. She also has difficulty walking more than a few steps without pain which she describes as crippling.  Smoking history: Former smoker  quit 15 years ago.  Alcohol use: None.  Illicit drug use: None.  Family history: Father and older brother both had 'poor blood flow' in their legs leading to amputations in the late stages of their lives.  She lives alone but has supportive neighbors who have been encouraging her to seek medical help. She is retired and reports financial troubles  which have resulted in her not seeking care earlier.  Findings on physical examination: 1) Lower extremity exam reveals slightly decreased temperature to palpation of the right foot compared to the left. 2) There are diminished pulses in the right lower extremity and an ulcer on the plantar surface of her foot. 3) Moderate to severe pain on even slight movement of her right toes. 4) Muscle wasting in her right calf and thigh is evident  with slightly reduced strength.   Her symptoms and past medical history are concerning for progressing critical limb ischemia. Immediate attention is warranted due to the potential risk of limb loss with delayed treatment.
7,2,43,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial43,Patient Information: Mr. John Smith  a 75-year-old African American male  comes into the office for consultation regarding left leg pain.  Chief Complaint: Severe pain in the left lower extremity for last two weeks  at its worst at rest and during the night.   History of Present Illness: The patient details a gradual onset of pain in the left leg over the past six months  though the pain worsened considerably in the past two weeks. Describes it as severe  burning pain primarily in his foot and calf. Symptoms associated with non-healing wounds on his foot. He also complaints of having trouble walking due to pain.  Past Medical History: Patient has a history of smoking for 40 years  hypertension  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 10 years  and peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnosed 5 years prior.   Social History: The patient is a retired warehouse employee living with his wife. He admits to a smoking habit of a pack of cigarettes a day for the past 40 years. Drinks alcohol socially. He has no known drug allergies.  Review of Systems: All other systems were reviewed and were negative.  Physical Examination: Physical examination revealed an extremely pale left foot with poor capillary refill. Diminished pulses were noted in the left dorsal pedis and posterior tibial arteries. Non-healing ulcers observed on the dorsum of the foot.  Based on the patient’s presentation - severe rest pain  non-healing wounds  and significant smoking and PAD history - this appears to be a case of critical limb ischemia. Further diagnostic evaluation and management would be necessary.
7,2,44,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial44,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Stevens  a 72-year-old African American male  former smoker with a 30-pack-year history and a sedentary lifestyle  was brought to the emergency department by his wife complaining of severe and persistent pain in his left leg at rest for the last 72 hours. The pain has been constant  8/10  and hasn't responded to over-the-counter pain relievers. His wife added that recently he had been complaining of coldness in the foot and occasional numbness. Over the past week  he stood up with difficulty and reported having severe pain even while sleeping.  His past medical history is significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  coupled with poor glycemic control  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and he had a myocardial infarction about 3 years ago but did not require any intervention. He has a 10-year history of intermittent claudication symptoms managed conservatively. He also reported erectile dysfunction developing over the past year. His medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin.  Physical examination revealed a thin  anxious elderly man in severe distress  with a BMI of 22. Both feet were cold to the touch  but the left was colder. There were absent pulses below the knee in the left leg  especially dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery. The left foot appeared slightly pale compared to the right foot. There were ulcers on the heel and dorsal aspect of the left foot  with signs of necrosis but no signs of infection. The capillary refill time of the left toe was more than 5 seconds.  His severe unilateral limb pain at rest  physical examination findings  coupled with pulse abnormalities  and non-healing ulcers and tissue loss are indicative of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Urgent consultation with vascular surgery and cardiovascular medicine was sought.
7,2,45,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial45,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 67-year-old African-American male presenting with severe rest pain on his left lower limb for the past several weeks. His pain has worsened over time and is now unbearable  particularly during the night.  He reports to have noticed a non-healing ulcer on his left foot. On physical examination  it reveals a 2cm ulcer on the medial aspect of the left foot with surrounding erythema and slight temperature elevation.  On further inquiry  Mr. Johnson reports to have been a smoker for 30 years  but quit smoking 10 years ago. He has a known history of uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 15 years and has been on oral anti-diabetic medications. He mentions having taken treatment for Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) diagnosed 5 years ago.  Mr. Johnson also has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and was treated for a myocardial infarction 8 years ago. He's currently taking antihypertensives and cholesterol-lowering drugs. His personal history shows a sedentary lifestyle.  No known drug allergies and not currently on anticoagulant. His BMI is 31  pointing out to being obese. Additionally  his family history is significant for stroke and coronary artery disease in a sibling and parent  respectively.  The bluish discoloration of the toes  weak distal pulses  and coldness of the left foot accompanied by the rest pain and ulcer suggests a likely diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. 
7,2,46,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial46,Patient Presentation:  A 69-year-old African American male presents with severe rest pain in his right lower extremity that has been ongoing for the past three weeks. The patient describes his pain as a burning sensation around the calf and foot regions. The pain tends to get worse during the night and sometimes awakens him from sleep.  In addition to the pain  he has been experiencing some skin discoloration and temperature changes in his right leg. He has also noticed sores on his toes that do not seem to be healing. He denies any recent trauma to the area. He also denies experiencing any chest pain or shortness of breath.  His vital signs upon initial presentation are as follows: Blood pressure 135/85 mmHg; Heart rate: 80 bpm; Respiratory rate: 16/min; Temperature: 98.6°F; Pulse oximetry: 98% on room air. On physical examination  the right leg appears pale compared to the left. Pulse is weakly palpable in the right femoral  popliteal  and dorsalis pedis arteries. The patient's right foot is cool to the touch with poor capillary refill (>3 seconds).  The patient's past medical history is significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension  and a 45-pack-year smoking history. He was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease two years ago  but he did not follow-up regularly with his primary care physician or adhere to prescribed medications due to lack of health insurance. He does not have any known drug allergies.   Family history is relevant for a father who died from an acute myocardial infarction at the age of 67 and a mother with a history of stroke. The patient is retired and lives alone. He quit smoking a year ago but still consumes alcohol socially. He does not engage in any exercise due to his severe leg pain. He is currently not on any medication.

7,2,48,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial48,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John is a 68-year-old African-American male who presents to the clinic with complaints of severe and continuous pain in his right lower leg and foot  present even at rest. He reports that the pain is often worsened at night and he has even noticed ulcers developing on his foot that don't seem to be healing. Furthermore  he reports his foot often feels cold to the touch and is a noticeably deathly pale color.   Upon questioning  the patient notes he has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  Type 2 diabetes mellitus and a 50-year history of smoking one pack per day  although he quit five years ago. He takes medications for his hypertension and diabetes and follows his prescribed diet and physical exercise. He denies any known allergies to food or drugs.  He has experienced intermittent claudication in the past–pain while walking that subsides with rest–but has never had these continuous  severe symptoms. He reports that these symptoms have been present for about four weeks now  progressively worsening over that time.   Family history is significant with paternal grandparents both having had peripheral artery disease  and a father who died of a myocardial infarction at a young age. The patient is retired  lives with his wife  and denies drinking and drug use. He is worried about the possibility of losing his foot due to the symptoms.
7,2,49,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial49,Patient Presentation:  An 85-year-old African American male presents at the clinic today with prime complaints of severe and persistent pain in his left lower leg  which has been bothering him for the last 2 months. The patient has a chronic history of diabetes mellitus (Type-2) for the past 10 years and hypertension for 7 years  both of which are reasonably managed with medications. He denies any smoking or alcohol abuse in the past or present and maintains a balanced diet. The patient has a family history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) with his elder brother suffering from the same.

7,2,55,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial55,Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Doe  a 72-year-old male Caucasian patient  presents stating that he has been experiencing a severe increase in pain in his left lower leg and foot over the past 5 weeks. Mr. Doe describes the pain as constant and increasing with any movement  but also present at rest. It is severe enough to prevent him from sleeping well and interrupting his daily activities. He also reports a noticeable loss of hair on the leg  a visible ulcer on his left foot that has not improved despite prescribed antibiotic treatment  and chronic fatigue. He has a long-standing history of Type II Diabetes and Hyperlipidemia  having been diagnosed approximately 20 years ago. His medications include Metformin and Atorvastatin. He has a positive family history for peripheral arterial disease. He also admits to heavier alcohol and tobacco consumption of approximately 40 years.  On examination  there is a palpable chill in his left foot and ankle  the skin is pale and shiny with a ulcer about 1.5cm diameter on the plantar aspect of foot. No distal pulses could be palpated in the left foot and weak in the left popliteal area but stronger in the right lower limb. Foot blanches with elevation and gets reddish when placed down. His ankle-brachial index (ABI) is significantly reduced and below 0.4.   Diagnosis:  These symptoms and clinical findings are very suggestive of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  possibly due to peripheral arterial disease secondary to his diabetes. A Doppler ultrasound or angiogram diagnostic test will be necessary to confirm.
7,2,56,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial56,Patient Profile: John Doe  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  presents with significant rest pain in the right lower extremity.  Presenting Symptoms: Patient complains of persistent pain in the lower extremity  particularly when he is at rest or during the night. He describes a continual burning sensation in his toes and the soles of his feet that is not alleviated by elevating the limb. There are also non-healing ulcers noted on his right foot.

The left foot remained pink with strong pulses and no ulcerations.  Given his presentation and past medical history  the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia is considered  and he is managed accordingly with immediate attention to pain control and optimizing blood flow to the limb.
7,2,58,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial58,Patient Presentation:  Ms. M is a 67-year-old African American woman who presents to the clinic with severe pain in her right leg  which she notices  is particularly worse following physical activity but is also present at rest. She states that the pain makes it difficult for her to sleep at night. Ms. M mentions the pain is concentrated below the knee  primarily in her calf.  She has been experiencing discoloration and ulcerations in the lower part of her right leg. The ulcer on her big toe has been worsening  with limited healing over the past weeks  raising concerns. She does not experience any chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations. She has some difficulty in walking long distances  which she attributes to the leg pain.  Past Medical History:  She has a significant history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  all of which are treated with medication but she admits to frequently forgetting her doses. She has a 40 pack-year smoking history but has not been successful in quitting despite multiple attempts. She experienced a transient ischemic attack 2 years ago but has since been stable on aspirin. She has no known allergies to medications.  Family history includes a father who died from myocardial infarction and a brother with peripheral artery disease. She is currently living alone since her husband passed away five years ago  and she has three grown children living out of state. She retired from her secretarial job two years ago.
7,2,59,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial59,"Patient Presentation:  A 64-year-old African-American male presented to the emergency department with severe pain  pallor  and coldness in his left lower extremity that started six hours prior to arrival. The pain  which he described as a sharp  """"10-out-of-10"""" discomfort  did not respond to over-the-counter pain medication.  The patient displayed signs of rest pain  especially at night when lying flat  and said that he had to hang his leg over the bed's edge to find some relief. He also noted that sores and ulcers on his lower leg and foot had been stubbornly slow healing  with some ulcerations showing no signs of healing at all. Upon examination  the patient’s left lower extremity was cold to touch without palpable pulse  and visible skin discoloration was observed.  His past medical history was significant for Type II diabetes mellitus for which he was on Metformin  hypertension managed by Lisinopril  and a 30-year history of smoking  approximately one pack a day. He also reported that he had been diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) two years ago but did not follow up on medical treatment as recommended.   No known allergies were identified and family history revealed that his father had had a below-the-knee amputation due to PAD complications. The patient denied any alcohol or illicit drug use.   This male patient’s demographic details and extensive past medical history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and PAD increase his risk for critical limb ischemia. His race  being African-American  also places him at a higher risk. His PAD's mismanagement amplifies these risks  demonstrating the necessity of appropriate long-term management with patients suffering from PAD to avoid progression to critical limb ischemia."
7,2,60,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial60,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson  a 68-year-old African-American male  presents to the Emergency Department  escorted by his son. He complains of sharp  intense pain in his right lower leg  which he describes as being continuous  even at rest  and escalating over the past two months. He rates it as an 8 on a pain scale of 0 to 10. The pain is so severe it usually wakes him from sleep. Over the counter analgesics do not alleviate the pain. Additionally  he mentioned that his right foot is unusually cold to touch and has noticed a color change to slightly blue.  Relevant Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson is a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 15 years ago  along with hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed by medication. He was a one-pack a day smoker for 40 years  but he claims to have quit approximately five years ago. He also briefly mentions a history of occasional intermittent claudication over the past few years.
7,2,61,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial61,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe is a 65-year-old male with a significant history of 20 years of poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus and a deep venous thrombosis 6 years ago. He has a smoking history of 20 packs per year. His BMI is 29 indicative of overweight. He is currently taking Metformin and Warfarin.   Over the last one week  Mr. Doe is experiencing a severe pain in his left lower extremity even while at rest. He initially ignored thinking it as a regular pain associated with ageing  but it started increasing in intensity over time  disturbing his sleep.   Along with increasing pain in the leg  he noticed that his foot started to appear darker than usual with a bluish-black discoloration. The discomfort aggravated with physical exertions like walking (claudication) and lessened upon elevating the limb. He also reported an open sore (ulcer) on his big toe that has not healed for the past 3 weeks.  On initial physical examination  the left leg appears pale and cold to touch when compared to the right. The left foot shows a painful non-healing ulcer over his big toe showing signs of necrosis. The distal pulses in the left leg (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial) are not palpable. No audible bruits present on auscultation of the femoral region.  On this presentation  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia is highly suspected.
7,2,62,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial62,Patient Information: Mr. Robert Sanchez  65-year-old Hispanic male  retired  married.  Chief Complaint: Severe pain in the right leg that has lasted for the past four days.  History of Present Illness: Patient reports intermittent claudication over the past six months  progressively worsening to constant pain even in rest over the last 4 days. The pain is significantly severe  limiting his daily activity. The right foot has developed a pale coloration and feels cold to touch. Patient also noted a sore on the foot that is not healing.  Past Medical History: Patient has history of long-term smoking (around 40 pack years)  uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus for 10 years  Hypertension for 15 years  and high cholesterol levels. Patient had a myocardial infarction five years ago and was treated with balloon angioplasty and a stent. He does not have any known allergies.   Family History: Father died from a myocardial infarction at 67  mother died from a stroke at 72  one brother has diabetes and hypertension.  Social History: Patient is a retired mechanic  lives with his wife. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years with an average of 20 cigarettes per day. Drinks alcohol occasionally. Maintains a diet high in fat and carbohydrate.  Medications: Metformin  Lisinopril  Simvastatin  baby Aspirin all taken regularly.  Review of Systems: Decreased appetite but no weight loss. No fever or chills. Patient seems to experience fatigue and shortness of breath sooner than usual.  Physical Examination: Vital signs stable. Pale right foot compared to left  diminished to absent right pedal pulses  a small ulcer on the right big toe  capillary refill was delayed on right foot. There were no signs of infection. Cardiac and lung exams were within the normal limits.  Based on the aforementioned details  he likely has critical limb ischemia secondary to peripheral artery disease  further complicated by his diabetes  and smoking history. An urgent vascular surgery consult has been advised.
7,2,63,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial63,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Sanchez is a 68-year-old male of Hispanic descent presenting with rest pain in his left lower leg that has been increasing for the past two months. He reports that the pain worsening  especially during the night making it difficult to sleep. The pain is alleviated when he dangles his leg over the side of his bed. In addition  he has noticed that his toes have a bluish discoloration and are chronically cold. He is worried because an ulcer has developed along his lateral malleolus that was initially small but has enlarged over time.   Past Medical History: Mr. Sanchez is a former smoker with a 40-pack-year smoking history. He quit 10 years ago. He has a past medical history significant for poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 20 years. He also suffers from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with a previous MI (Myocardial Infarction) 6 years ago. He has hyperlipidemia and hypertension managed with statins and ACE inhibitors. His family history is significant for peripheral artery disease; his father developed gangrene in his foot in his later years.
7,2,64,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial64,Patient Information: A 67-year-old African American male presents to the outpatient clinic.  Chief Complaint: Severe pain in the right lower limb  which increases at rest and is often unbearable during night-time. He also complains of a non-healing ulcer on his right foot.  History of Present Illness: He says the pain started gradually  increasing over the last couple of months. The patient noticed a small wound on his foot about 2 weeks ago  which has now become bigger with blackening in some areas. He has noticed some loss of hair on his lower limb. He has not had any trauma to the foot. He denies fever  chills  or any other systemic symptoms.  Past Medical History: He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Hypertension (HTN) 3 years back  for which he is on Metformin and Ramipril. His DM and HTN have been poorly controlled. He is a smoker with approximately 30 pack-years history.  Family History: His father died of a heart attack at the age of 70. His mother had DM and HTN and died due to renal failure at 76.  Review of Systems (ROS): General: Weight loss of approximately 5 pounds in the last month Cardiovascular: No chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath Gastrointestinal: No abdominal pain  nausea or vomiting  Physical Examination: Vital Signs: BP: 150/92  Pulse: 100/min  Temp: 98.6°F  Respiratory Rate: 18/min  Cardiovascular: S1 & S2 present  no added sounds Abdomen: Soft  non-tender Lower Extremity: Amputation of all toes except for the big toe on the right foot; area surrounding the wound is blackish and cold; diminished right femoral  popliteal  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses compared to the contralateral limb. Hair loss present.  Based on the history and the findings on examination  the patient is likely to have developed critical limb ischemia in the setting of peripheral artery disease.
7,2,65,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial65,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Johnson  a 63-year-old African American male  presents in the emergency department complaining of acute  severe pain in his left lower leg which has been escalating over the last few weeks. He describes the pain as constant and not mitigated by rest. He also mentions intermittent claudication during minor physical activity such as walking short distances.   Upon examination  there is an ulcer on the anterior aspect of his left foot and a color change  appearing pale and cooler to touch as compared to the right foot. He also reports decreased sensation in his left foot  and he has noted some hair loss on his left leg. Distal pulses are irregular and weak in his left foot.   His vital signs are stable - BP: 145/90 mmHg  pulse: 86 bpm  respiration: 18 bpm  and body temperature: 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit.   Past medical history is significant for Type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he takes Metformin  and hypertension  controlled with Lisinopril. He is a former smoker  with a 30 pack-year history  but quit 10 years earlier. His BMI is calculated to be 28  qualifying as overweight. His lifestyle is rather sedentary as he is retired and spends most of his time at home. His dietary history includes a preference for processed foods and fast food  with minimal fruits and vegetables.  In view of these findings  the patient is suspected to have critical limb ischemia (CLI)  probably due to peripheral artery disease (PAD). 
7,2,66,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial66,Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Doe  a 68-year-old non-Hispanic white male  currently living alone and working as a retired engineer  presented to the clinic with a complaint of rest pain in his right foot persisting over the past week. He stated that the pain was severe enough to wake him from sleep and was accompanied by numbness and occasional tingling. He also reported that the color of his foot had darkened and has noticed a decrease in temperature to touch. He denies any history of trauma or recent injury.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Doe has a documented history of hypertension  diagnosed at age 50  which is under control with Lisinopril. He has an uncontrolled type-2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at 55 years old  currently on Metformin. His most recent HbA1C reading  taken six months ago  was 8.9%. He has a 30-year history of smoking one packet of cigarettes per day but quit 5 years ago. The patient also suffered a mild stroke two years ago with a full recovery. No allergies have been documented in his medical record. His family history showed his father had a myocardial infarction at age 70 and died at 75 due to stroke. His mother was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes. He is currently not on any blood thinners or anti-platelet medication.   Physical Examination:   On physical exam  his foot appeared discolored and cold to touch. Palpation of the right foot revealed absent right posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses.   Diagnostic Evaluation:  Based on the physical examination  rest pain  discoloration  and history of uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and previous stroke  a presumptive diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was made. Mr. Doe has been advised for further diagnostic testing to confirm the diagnosis.
7,2,67,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial67,Patient Presentation:  A 72-year-old African American male is brought into the clinic today with a chief complaint of severe rest pain in his right lower extremity. The pain is often accompanied by numbness  extreme coldness  and changes in skin color. The patient also mentions an unhealing wound on his right heel that has been present for approximately two weeks.   He reports a past medical history significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed 10 years ago) with poor blood sugar control (last HbA1c was 8.5%)  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and he is a two-pack-a-day smoker with a 40-year smoking history. He has a history of peripheral arterial disease diagnosed 5 years back with no history of angioplasty or bypass surgery and admits to non-compliance with prescribed medications (antiplatelets and statins) and lifestyle modifications due to lack of comprehensive health literacy.  His family history is significant with his father and two uncles who were diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). His social history includes alcohol usage limited to occasional drinks and he lives with his wife as the primary caregiver.  On physical examination  there is noticeable pallor when the right foot is elevated and dusky redness when it is dependent. The right foot is cooler compared to the left foot. Palpation reveals absent pulses on the affected extremity (right femoral  popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial). There is a visible ulceration on his right heel with dry gangrene of the adjacent toes.  Based on the medical history and physical findings  the patient is believed to be presenting with the severe stage of peripheral artery disease known as critical limb ischemia.
7,2,68,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial68,Patient Presentation  Mr. Jones is a 70-year-old Caucasian male referred to the peripheral vascular clinic presenting with severe rest pain in his right lower leg. He reports the pain has been worsening over the past five months  and is now intolerable. The pain particularly intensifies when his leg is elevated  especially at night. He suffers from intermittent claudication walking close to half a block  leading to a significant decrease in his activity level. On further exploration  he reports an approximate of 22-pound unintentional weight loss over the past four months  due to loss of appetite and occasional nausea.  His medical history is significant for a 40-pack year history of smoking (only quit five years ago)  Type 2 diabetes mellitus under poor control (HbA1c at 9.6%)  hypertension  and a myocardial infarction eight years ago. He has been compliant with his medications  which include metformin  lisinopril and aspirin.  Upon physical examination  his right foot was markedly colder than the left  with mottled skin and decreased hair growth. Pedal pulses (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial) were not palpable in the right foot. Distinctive signs of muscle atrophy and shiny skin were also evident on the right lower limb.  Given the severity of the rest pain  the chronicity of symptoms  and his risk factors of diabetes and smoking  Mr. Jones was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia  the most severe form of peripheral artery disease. Prompt diagnostic tests including Ankle-Brachial Index and angiogram were ordered for further evaluation.
7,2,69,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial69,Patient Information: 66-year-old Caucasian male   Chief Complaint: Severe rest pain in the right foot for three weeks  increasing progressively despite medication for pain.  History of Present Illness: The patient reports he was previously able to walk a few blocks without experiencing any pain in his right foot  but that changed three weeks ago when he began to experience severe pain  which he describes as aching and throbbing. This pain now occurs both at rest and with minor exertion. He also complains of a nonhealing ulcer on his right big toe that started 2 weeks ago. He denies any history of fever  excessive weight loss or chest discomfort.  Past Medical History: The patient has a long history of uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes for the past 12 years and hypertension for 10 years. He smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 30 years  but stopped smoking five years ago when diagnosed with COPD.  Review of System: Denies any signs of chest pain  palpitations  dyspnea  gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms  or changes in bowel or bladder habits.   Family History: His father had peripheral artery disease and underwent a bypass surgery in his late sixties.  Physical Examination: A painful  nonhealing 2 cm ulcer noted on his right big toe. Pulses are absent in the right leg.   Social History: The patient lives with his wife in a suburban home. He is a retired mechanic. He does not consume alcohol. He is currently on various medications for his diabetes  hypertension and COPD.  This presentation is consistent with a case of critical limb ischemia  particularly concerning due to the potential risk of amputation if not managed immediately. The patient's uncontrolled diabetes and extensive history of smoking are likely major contributing factors  with his family history suggesting a potential genetic predisposition.
7,2,70,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial70,Patient Information: 68-year-old African American male.  Chief Complaint: Experiencing severe pain in the lower left leg that is not alleviated with rest. Pain seems worse at night and often interferes with his sleep. Reports of non-healing sores on the same foot  which developed about two weeks ago.  History of Present Illness: Patient first noticed mild pain in his leg about four months ago after walking short distances  typically relieved with rest. The pain progressively increased over the course of the past month and is now constant and severe. Recently  he also found ulcerations near the toe region which are not healing. He denies any history of trauma. He reports experiencing symptoms of intermittent claudication previously.  Past Medical History: Patient has a documented history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 12 years. He also maintains a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is a former smoker with a 25 pack-year history who quit 6 years ago.  Medications: Metformin  Lisinopril  Simvastatin  daily aspirin.  Physical Examination: Significant for pallor and coolness of the left leg with decreased pulses compared to the contralateral side. Noticed two open sores on the foot  one on the toe and one on the heel with mild erythema and no apparent signs of infection. Distal hair loss and thickened nails were observed.  These symptoms collectively suggest that the patient may be suffering from critical limb ischemia  a severe manifestation of peripheral arterial disease. By history  physical examination and risk factors like advanced age  diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and a significant smoking history  the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia is considered. Further diagnostic tests and vascular consultation would be necessary for the definitive diagnosis and management plan.
7,2,71,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial71,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James is a 71-year-old African-American male with a long history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He has been a smoker for over 40 years  and his lifestyle is largely sedentary. He also has a history of high cholesterol levels and has been on medication for the same.   He presents today with complaints of severe  constant pain in his lower left leg  especially the foot  even during rest. He reports intermittent claudication  with the pain increasing significantly in the last two weeks. Mr. James also indicates that he has noticed some sores on his toes that do not seem to heal. He has been unable to sleep due to the pain and often has to dangle his leg over the side of the bed to relieve it.   Examining his leg shows an absence of pulses both dorsally and posteriorly. His left foot appears pale and slightly discolored  and is cold to touch in comparison with his right foot. Two ulcers are noted on his left toes  surrounded by discoloration and hard tissue. Distally  there is noticeable hair loss and shiny skin. Capillary refill time is delayed significantly. The patient exhibits no signs of systemic infection but is clearly distressed by pain.   The patient continues to live with his wife and is fairly independent with the activities of daily living  but has been restricted recently due to the pain in the leg. He is compliant with his medications but admits to not managing his diet and exercise for his diabetes as well as he should.
7,2,72,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial72,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Smith is a 75-year-old African American male who presents with excruciating pain in his right lower leg at rest  which has been ongoing for the past 3 weeks.   History of Present Illness:   Aside from the pain  Mr. Smith explains that he has noticed poor healing of a minor wound on his right foot. His symptoms have been getting progressively worse  with the excruciating pain disturbing his sleep at night. He reports a significant decrease in his physical activity due to the pain and discomfort.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith has a known 15-year history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. He has no known drug allergies but takes Metformin and Atenolol for his diabetes and hypertension  respectively. He underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for chronic total occlusion of his right popliteal artery four years ago. His family history consists of cardiovascular diseases  including his father who had a fatal heart attack at the age of 65.  Vital Signs & Physical Exam:   Vital signs are within normal limits. A physical exam of the lower extremities reveals cold right foot with non-palpable distal pulses  shiny skin  absent hair growth on the right leg  and a purple hue to the right foot and lower leg suggesting poor oxygen supply to his limb.   The provided information is suggestive of critical limb ischemia with possible concomitant peripheral artery disease due to significant cardiovascular risk factors with a history of prior peripheral intervention.
7,2,73,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial73,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 75-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the clinic with complaints of worsening bilateral leg pain  particularly in his right calf  over the last six months which has progressed to rest pain and non-healing ulcers on his right foot for the past three weeks. He reports that the pain is severe and disrupts his sleep. Mr. Johnson also mentions that he experiences relief after placing his legs in a dependent position. He has had a significant loss of body weight due to loss of appetite.  Mr. Johnson has a 40-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day and moderate alcohol use. He has had Type 2 Diabetes for the past 10 years and has a history of hypertension which has been managed with medication for the past 15 years. He also had a myocardial infarction approximately five years ago. There is no known family history of peripheral arterial disease.   On examination  both his feet are cold to touch with decreased capillary refill time (>3 seconds). His right foot exhibits dry gangrene with two ulcers on the dorsal aspect  each measuring 2-3 cm in diameter with necrotic bases. His popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial pulses are not palpable on the right and are diminished on the left. Lower extremity oedema was also noted. His body mass index is 21.  Mr. Johnson's lifestyle  coupled with his medical history suggests an advanced peripheral artery disease which has likely progressed to critical limb ischemia. 
7,2,74,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial74,Patient Presentation: Mr. John Doe  a 68-year-old African American male  presented to the clinic with bilateral lower extremity pain and non-healing sores on his right foot. The pain  described as a constant  burning sensation  is particularly severe when he's laying down and slightly mitigates when he hangs his feet over the side of his bed. He also reports experiencing fatigue and weakness in both legs  which has inhibited his ability to walk long distances without rest. Furthermore  he mentioned that his right foot feels cool to touch and appears pale. His pain level is recorded as 7/10.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a significant medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is poorly controlled  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He's also a former smoker  having quit 5 years ago but had a 40-pack year history. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 8 years ago after having a myocardial infarction. Records also reveal that he had a transient ischemic attack 2 years back  from which he fully recovered. He is currently on metformin  lisinopril  atorvastatin  and aspirin.  Demographics: Mr. Doe is a retired school bus driver  living with his wife in a suburban neighborhood. They have two adult children who live out of state. He is financially secure  with health insurance coverage. He denies alcohol use but has a history of heavy tobacco use. He is not actively engaging in regular physical activities  has poor dietary habits  and is obese with a BMI of 32.   Given his symptoms and history  the clinical suspicion of critical limb ischemia is high  necessitating further investigation and intervention. His uncontrolled diabetes and long history of smoking add significant risks too.
7,2,75,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial75,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 78-year-old Caucasian male presenting with severe  unrelenting pain in his left lower leg  which he rates as a 9 on a 10-point pain scale. The pain  characterized as aching and burning  is most severe in the foot and has persisted for 6 months. Over the last month  it has become constant  even at rest  and has significantly interfered with his sleep and daily activities  especially walking.  Mr. J reports that his left foot often feels cold and has a bluish discoloration. He also reveals recurrent heel ulcers over the past 5 months  which he believes are taking longer to heal than previously. The patient denies any recent trauma or injury to the leg. His symptoms have mildly responded to over-the-counter pain medication.  He has an extensive past medical history of atherosclerosis  type 2 diabetes mellitus for 18 years  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 50-pack-year history of smoking  though he quit 5 years ago. He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery about 12 years back. He has no known allergies.  On a physical exam  the left leg is noticeably colder compared to the right. Pulses in the left leg are weak and barely palpable  while the right leg pulses are within a typical range. There is a noticeable loss of hair on the left leg and foot. An ulcer  approximately 2.5 cm in diameter  with minimal drainage and signs of infection  is observed on the left heel. The foot appears to be cyanotic and dystrophic nails are noticed.  This clinical scenario suggests critical limb ischemia  primarily resulting from peripheral arterial disease exacerbated by long-standing diabetes  atherosclerosis  and a history of tobacco use.
7,2,76,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial76,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Philip Anderson  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presents with a persistent  severe and unrelenting pain in his right lower limb. He describes the pain as dull and aching  occurring even at rest  with escalating intensity over the past two weeks. Mr. Anderson also mentions persistent coldness of the leg  pallor  and numbness.  The patient is a former construction worker who recently retired after 40 years in the trade. He has a 35-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day but quit approximately two months ago. He has a medical history of obesity  hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). His last lower extremity angiogram was performed five years ago  which confirmed the diagnosis of PAD.   Mr. Anderson's medication regimen includes amlodipine 10mg for hypertension  metformin 500mg for diabetes  and low-dose aspirin. He admits to being non-compliant with his medications over the past month due to financial constraints. He also admits to inadequate management of his diabetes and hypertension.   Furthermore  he discloses that he has unexplained weight loss  loss of appetite  and has been unable to walk short distances due to pain  which indicates possible advanced disease. He has no known allergies and his family history includes a father with coronary artery disease and a mother with stroke. He lives alone  and his daughter helps with groceries and weekly house cleaning.
7,2,77,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial77,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jones is a 78-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a one-month history of worsening right lower extremity pain. He describes the pain as constant  sharp  and located primarily in his right foot and calf. His pain significantly increases with walking and sometimes occurs at rest. He also reports an ulcer on his right big toe that has been present for a few weeks  which is not healing.  He has a past medical history significant for Type 2 Diabetes mellitus that has been poorly controlled over the years  peripheral artery disease diagnosed 2 years ago  hypertension  and a 50-pack year smoking history  although he quit 10 years earlier.  He had applied a local ointment for the ulcer  but it did not improve. He reports no fevers  chills  or other systemic symptoms.  On physical examination  his right lower extremity is noted to be cooler compared to the left. Peripheral pulses are diminished in his right foot. He has a 2x2 cm ulcer with black eschar on his right great toe with minimal serous drainage.  This presentation is concerning for critical limb ischemia  a severe stage of peripheral artery disease  typically associated with rest pain  non-healing wounds  and risk for limb amputation if not promptly treated. His risk factors include his age  diabetes  history of smoking  and existing diagnosis of peripheral artery disease.
7,2,78,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial78,Patient Presentation:  Ms. M is a 75-year-old African-American female presenting to the ER with complaints of rest pain in her right lower extremity which she states has been worsening over the past several weeks. The pain is localized to her foot and is described as burning and cramping. The pain is severe enough that it leads to awakenings in the night. She also mentions existence of non-healing sores on her right foot. Ms. M reports a history of claudication in the same extremity  but the pain which was previously relieved with rest has now become constant. She denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or dizziness.  Upon examination  the lower extremity is cool to touch  with diminished pulses and sensory loss. There is a noticeable pallor when the leg is elevated and dependent rubor on lowering. The non-healing ulcers are noted on the foot  with a few areas showing signs of infection.  Past Medical History: Ms. M has a successful history of managing hypertension and type 2 diabetes for the past 15 years and was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) three years ago. She is also a long-term smoker and confesses to have struggled with quitting smoking in the past. She underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting five years ago following a diagnosis of coronary artery disease.  This woman's past medical history and examination findings point towards critical limb ischemia  necessitating further urgent investigation to confirm the diagnosis and consideration of revascularization options.

Previous smoker  quit 5 years ago but smoked 1 pack a day for 30 years. 5. Family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of a heart attack at 70 years.  Clinical examination reveals a cold right foot with absent distal pulses. A deep ulcer measuring approx 5cm in diameter is present on the medial aspect of the right lower leg  exhibiting necrotic tissue in its bed and surrounding erythema. No signs of infection are detected. The patient reports that the lesion started as a small wound around 6 weeks ago that has progressively worsened.  Further diagnostic work-up and consultation with a vascular surgeon is ordered to confirm diagnosis of suspected critical limb ischemia (CLI). The patient's upper limb blood pressure is normal  but his ankle-brachial index (ABI) scores are less than 0.4  indicative of severe limb ischemia. Angiography displays a severe blockage in both the arteries supplying his right lower limb. His glycemic status  lipid profile and renal functions are out of normal range. The patient is indicated for urgent angioplasty with the possibility of bypass surgery. Advice for better glycemic control  lipid-lowering medications  and wound care are also given.
7,2,81,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial81,Patient Presentation  Mr. John Smith  a 68-year-old male  presents to the emergency department with severe rest pain in his left lower extremity persisting for the last 2 weeks. Patient describes the pain as burning and continuous  rating it 8/10 on the pain scale. The pain is worse at night and he's often awakened by it.   Past medical history is significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years. He is also a two-pack-per-day smoker  accumulating a 35 pack-year smoking history. He has a history of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) about 5 years ago; however  the patient states no known history of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction.   The patient reports that his symptoms have progressed over the past month  from intermittent claudication to this severe rest pain which is not relieved by analgesics. He also mentions a non-healing ulcer on his left toe  and he has noticed that his foot feels cold to touch. His symptoms have led to difficulty in walking and impairment in his daily activities.   Patient's current medications include metformin for diabetes  lisinopril for hypertension  and simvastatin for hyperlipidemia.
7,2,82,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial82,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith  a 72-year-old African American male presents to his primary care clinic with chief complaints of rest pain especially at night in his right lower extremity  and a non-healing wound on his right foot for the past few weeks. The pain  palpable around the calf region  is described as severe  burning  and is present even without any physical activity or exertion. The pain worsens when his foot is elevated and slightly alleviates when it is dependent.   Past Medical History: The patient's medical record indicates an extensive past medical history that includes uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  peripheral arterial disease and a 40-year history of smoking two packs per day  which he stopped around 4 years back.  He reported a history of endovascular surgery for left lower extremity two years ago. He has been non-compliant with his medications  has a poor diet  and lacks a regular exercise regimen despite previous counseling and education. Family history indicates both his father and elder brother also suffered from peripheral arterial disease and coronary artery disease. Mr. Smith retired 10 years ago from a high-stressed job and lives with his wife and has limited social connection. His activities of daily living have been impaired due to pain-induced sleep disruption and the fear of losing his foot or probably his life.
7,2,83,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial83,Patient Presentation:  We have a 68-year-old African-American male patient presenting with severe pain in his right lower leg  particularly when walking  which could indicate the onset of critical limb ischemia. The pain has persisted for the past few weeks and is accompanied by chronic fatigue and shortness of breath. He has also observed discoloration and non-healing ulceration in the lower leg.  Patient Demographics:  Name: Mr. Samuel Jackson Age: 68 years Sex: Male Race: African-American Residential Address: Florida  United States Employment: Retired school teacher Marital Status: Widower  Relevant Past Medical History:  Mr. Jackson is diagnosed with Type II diabetes  which has been managed with oral medications for the past 10 years. He also had a history of hypertension  which has been controlled with medication since the diagnosis 12 years ago. He was a heavy smoker throughout his life  though he quit five years ago. Mr. Jackson's father had needed a heart bypass operation in his sixties  indicating a family history of cardiovascular diseases. Lately  his leg pain has been so severe that it disrupts sleep  and he has been often found positioning his leg over the edge of the bed. He also confirmed a significant weight loss over the past few months due to loss of appetite. Interestingly  his last lower limb pulses assessment  conducted a year ago  was normal.
7,2,84,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial84,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Jane Jones is a 67-year-old African American female presenting to the emergency department today with the chief complaint of severe  worsening pain in her left lower leg.   She states the pain has been ongoing for about six weeks but has increased significantly in intensity over the past two weeks. In addition  she mentions experiencing rest pain  particularly at night  with the pain temporarily relieved upon dangling the leg over the bedside. She also describes non-healing ulcers over the distal portion of the left foot.  She has a 35-year history of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus which has been poorly controlled due to noncompliance. She is also a smoker  averaging half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years  and has been diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore  she has a history of coronary artery disease and suffered a non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) two years ago.  On examination  the left lower extremity is colder compared to the right  with diminished distal pulses. The skin shows signs of atrophy  hair loss and there are multiple ulcers with foul-smelling discharge.  Imaging studies and formal vascular studies would be necessary to further evaluate the severity of her condition and to validate the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia. Her high risk factors including diabetes  smoking history  long-standing hyperlipidemia and hypertension  indicative symptoms and signs  point towards an urgent need to address her deteriorating peripheral arterial disease.
7,2,85,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial85,Patient Presentation:  Patient: John Peterson is a 70-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a three-week history of severe pain in the left lower limb  particularly when walking or lying flat. He describes it as a continuous  burning pain that does not improve with over-the-counter pain relievers. He also notes that his left foot has developed a persistent  non-healing sore and there is noticeable blackening of some toes.  Demographics: He is a retired truck driver  lives with his wife of 45 years  and is currently a regular smoker with a 50-pack year smoking history.  Medical History: Mr. Peterson has a 10-year history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He reports that he is non-compliant with his prescribed anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive medications due to financial constraints.  Family History: Both of his parents had cardiovascular disease  his father dying from a heart attack at the age of 65  and his mother suffering multiple strokes prior to death.  Surgical History: He has had no surgeries in the past.   Social History: He denies alcohol or illicit drug use. He admits to a diet high in processed and fast foods.  Physical Examination: On examination  the left lower limb is significantly colder than the right. Pulses in the left foot are not palpable. There are ulcers seen on the left foot along with gangrenous changes on several toes. Capillary refilling time on the left foot is markedly prolonged. No edema noted.   These findings  together with the patient’s history  are highly suggestive of critical limb ischemia.
7,2,86,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial86,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Patricia Harrison is a 78-year-old African-American female who presents to the office with a 2-week history of debilitating pain in her right lower leg and foot. The pain is severe  continuous and tends to increase at night  mostly described as dull and aching. Recently  she’s also noticed a non-healing ulcer on her right foot that has progressively worsened over the past week.  Patricia has a significant history of smoking  consuming 1 pack/day for the past 60 years but quit 5 years ago due to a diagnosis of COPD. She has a past medical history significant for hypertension for which she takes amlodipine  type 2 diabetes managed by metformin and insulin  and hyperlipidemia controlled by statins. She also has a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosed approximately 10 years ago.  She’s also experienced episodes of claudication when walking moderate distances but managed to control the intermittency of these episodes by moderating her activity level and daily walks.  She resides in a nursing home and has limited mobility. There’s no known history of drug allergies. However  she has no reported right lower extremity trauma or preceding infection. Her family history includes a father who had an amputation procedure due to peripheral artery disease. 
7,2,87,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial87,Patient Profile: Mr. James Harmon  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the vascular clinic accompanied by his son.  Chief Complaint:  He complains of intense pain in his left lower limb  even while resting. He rates his pain as a 9 on a scale of 10. It particularly disturbs him at night. He also observed a discoloration of his left foot  which now feels cold to touch. He mentions there is a non-healing wound on his left toe.  Relevant Past Medical History:  Mr. Harmon is a known case of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus since the last 15 years  and Moderate Hypertension since the past 10 years. He also reveals a history of a heart attack 5 years ago  post which he was on aspirin and statins. He confessed that he is a heavy smoker  with a 40-pack-year history.  Review of Systems: Mr. Harmon has lost 15 pounds of weight over the past two months and feels tired after minimal activity. His appetite has also decreased. His son reports that Mr. Harmon is increasingly becoming forgetful.  Physical Examination: On examination  there was a clear pulse deficit in the left foot compared to the right with diminished peripheral sensations. The small  non-healing ulcer was present on his left toe. The temperature of the left foot was comparatively lower  and it had a bluish discoloration suggesting cyanosis. However  no signs of deep vein thrombosis were noted.  Plan:  Start the patient on opioid analgesics until his pain subsides and admit him for further diagnostic investigations  including peripheral angiography  and possible vascular surgical consult. Control his diabetes and hypertension optimally. Provide him education and support to quit smoking. Also  refer him for a cardiology check-up and neurology referral for his memory issues.
7,2,88,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial88,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith is a 75-year-old Caucasian male with a significant history of smoking (1 pack/day for 40 years)  uncontrolled hypertension  and longstanding Type 2 diabetes mellitus presenting with worsening pain in his left lower extremity for the last two months. He reports constant  severe ache in his calf even at rest  which intensifies at night. The pain often wakes him up from sleep. He needs 2-3 pillows to elevate his leg in order to fall asleep. Moreover  he notes the onset of a non-healing ulcer on his left big toe that's been there for several weeks.   Upon examination  the left foot has a temperature cooler than the right one  absent pulses in left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis. There's an ulcer measuring 1cm in diameter with black eschar at the base on the tip of the left big toe. The left calf is relatively atrophic when compared to the right calf.  He recalls being diagnosed with peripheral artery disease approximately 5 years ago but was not compliant with medications and lifestyle modification  due to disregard for the potential complications associated with his condition.   In sum  the patient's critical risk factors include his advanced age  smoking history  poorly controlled hypertension  diabetic status  non-compliance with prescribed medications  and the presence of peripheral artery disease. These factors suggest a significant likelihood of his current symptoms being due to critical limb ischemia. 
7,2,89,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial89,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 70-year-old African American male from rural South Carolina who presents to the vascular clinic with a complaint of increasing right lower extremity pain over the last three months. The pain is significantly worse when he walks even short distances but also present at rest  particularly at night. He describes the pain as “burning” in nature that does not radiate. He also references a mild intermittent paralysis in the foot.   He has observed that his right foot appears paler and cooler to touch compared to his left foot. Lately  he has also noticed a ulcer on the heel of his right foot that he first noticed two weeks ago. He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or dizziness. He has never had a similar episode in the past.  His past medical history includes hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  for which he takes amlodipine and metformin  respectively. He also has a 40-pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He does not engage in regular physical activity due to arthritis. His diet is predominantly Southern-style cuisine with a high intake of fried foods and processed meats. He is noncompliant with his diabetic diet. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 76. He has been using over-the-counter wound ointments for the ulcer but with minimal improvement.  Physical examination revealed an underweight man in obvious distress due to right lower limb pain. Right foot was noted to be cold  and pale  particularly when elevated. Phone-brachial index was significantly reduced on the right side (0.4). A non-healing  painful ulcer was noted on the heel of the right foot. Rest of the systemic examination was normal.   On discussing the history and physical findings  Mr. Johnson was informed that his symptoms were consistent with critical limb ischemia and will require further investigation and prompt management to prevent progression.
7,2,90,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial90,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 65 years Sex: Male Occupation: Retired carpenter Ethnicity: Caucasian  Chief Complaint:   John presents with severe pain in his right lower leg both at rest and during activities  affecting his mobility and sleep quality.

Social History:  John lives alone since his wife passed away 2 years ago. He has 2 children who stay in another city and visit him occasionally. He has a 40-pack-year smoking history and used to consume alcohol socially but quit after his cardiac surgery. He does not exercise regularly.  Review of systems:   John has been experiencing fatigue and decreased appetite. No recent weight loss  fever  cough  shortness of breath  heart palpitations  or gastrointestinal symptoms.  Physical examination:  Upon inspection  John's right lower leg and foot appear pale and shiny with visible hair loss. There are two ulcerated areas on his toes  poorly healing with sluggish capillary refill. Pedal pulses are absent on palpation.
7,2,91,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial91,Patient Information: 75-year-old African American male   Chief Complaint: Severe  constant pain in the right lower leg  even while at rest.   History of Present Illness: The patient has been experiencing dull  cramping pain in his right calf for the past six months  which has progressively worsened over time and now occurs even during rest. The pain is relieved moderately with elevation and worsens with ambulation. The patient reports non-healing ulcers on the right foot. There is a decreased sensation in the foot. The patient also notes the foot is noticeably cooler than the left foot.  Past Medical History: He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled type II diabetes and hypertension. He is also a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history but quit 10 years ago. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 5 years ago for severe coronary artery disease. There is a history of high cholesterol levels but no other significant medical or surgical history.  Allergies: None known  Current Medications: Metformin  Lisinopril  Clopidogrel  and Statin  Social History: He lives with his wife and is retired. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.  Family History: His father had coronary artery disease and died from a stroke. His mother had diabetes.   Physical Examination: Blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg in right arm and 145/85 mm Hg in left arm. The heart has regular rhythm; no murmurs heard. Lung fields are clear. The abdomen is soft and non-tender. Right lower extremity reveals a cold foot  delayed capillary refill  non-healing ulcers  and absence of distal pulses. Left lower extremity findings are within normal limits.  This presentation is consistent with a case of critical limb ischemia in the right lower extremity  likely secondary to peripheral artery disease  requiring urgent evaluation and treatment.
7,2,92,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial92,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old African American male  presents with severe  unrelenting pain in his right foot which started 2 weeks ago. The pain often intensifies at night  disturbing his sleep. He states that the pain somewhat improves when he lets his leg hang over the side of his bed. He also mentions a non-healing ulcer on his right foot  which has been present for 4 weeks  gradually increasing in size. Upon screening  he reports a 30-year history of heavy smoking; about twenty cigarettes per day but quit 3 years ago. His past medical history includes a 10-year history of uncontrolled Type II Diabetes Mellitus  and medication-controlled Hypertension. The patient also has a history of peripheral artery disease and had undergone left leg angioplasty 5 years ago.  There’s no past history of any major surgeries  allergy  or other significant medical conditions. He is unmarried and lives alone  and is a retired carpenter by profession. He is currently on Metformin  Lisinopril  and Aspirin. There’s no history of any illicit drug use  excessive alcohol intake  or sexually transmitted diseases. His family history is significant for early onset coronary artery disease and stroke. His mother passed away at the age of 60 due to a heart attack.  The patient appears moderately distressed due to pain. His right foot appears pale with a noticeable ulcer on the plantar surface. The skin is cool to touch. Popliteal  posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses are notably weaker in the affected leg as compared to the left leg. Further  he has loss of hair on the affected leg and shiny skin. Preliminary conclusion suggests possible Critical Limb Ischemia. Urgent vascular consultation and diagnostic angiography are recommended.
7,2,93,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial93,Patient Presentation:   Ms. Susan Williams is a 65-year-old African American female who resides in an assisted living facility. She comes in today  accompanied by her son  complaining of severe rest pain in her left leg that she describes as “a constant  sharp pain” that gets worse at night. Her son also reports that he has noticed a non-healing ulcer on the left foot toe which was previously just a blister from her new shoes last month. Ms. Williams also mentions intermittent claudication (she experiences severe pain in her left calf even after a short distance of walking). Her pain is reported to be worse when her leg is elevated  primarily at rest and is relieved when dangled.   Past Medical History:  Ms. Williams reports that she is a two pack/day smoker for the past 15 years. She admits to ALD (Alcohol Liver Disease) and has been a chronic alcohol consumer for the past 20 years; she also mentions diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension. On further inquiry  Ms. Williams also admits to past episodes of TIA's (Transient Ischemic Attacks). She denies any known allergies to medications.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  the left lower extremity is cold to touch  with significantly reduced capillary refill time compared to the right leg. There is noticeable loss of hair on the leg  shiny atrophic skin and the toenails appear thickened. The non-healing ulcer on the left toe is about 3x3 cm with depth reaching the subcutaneous tissue and scanty purulent discharge. Her peripheral pulses (Dorsalis Pedis and Posterior Tibial) are not palpable on the left side whereas they are normal on the right side. The ankle brachial index (ABI) is 0.3  suggesting severe peripheral artery disease.  The rest of the complete physical examination  including cardio-respiratory and neurological examination  is essentially within normal limits.   Based on the patient’s clinical history  physical examination and risk factors (diabetes  smoking  and hyperlipidemia)  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia is fairly suggestive. Further diagnostic tests including angiography are planned for confirmation of the diagnosis. Ms. Williams is immediately advised for smoking cessation and management for the risk factors has been refined.      Ms. Williams has been informed about the gravity of her disease  the necessity of its urgent management and possibility of limb amputation if not managed promptly. She seems to understand and agrees to abide by the medical advice.
7,2,94,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial94,Patient Presentation:  A 69-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with a 3-week history of progressive right lower extremity pain. Initially  the patient was able to walk short distances  but the pain has now become so severe that it torments him even at rest  described as a constant  throbbing ache localized mainly to his right calf and ankle.   The pain escalates at night  necessitating him to dangle his leg over the bedside for temporary relief. He also noticed a dark  non-healing ulcer on the medial aspect of his right ankle 2 weeks ago  which concerns him  plus the recent onset of coolness to touch and pallor on his right foot.   As for past medical history  he is a former smoker with a 50-pack year history and quit smoking 2 years ago. He also has a 15-year history of uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with a recent HbA1c of 9.3%  hypertension diagnosed 8 years ago  currently on treatment  and was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease 3 years ago. No known family history of aneurysm or claudication. No known allergies reported.   The patient admitted to poor diet control despite his diabetes and hypertension and hardly exercises due to chronic lower limb discomfort.   Given the ongoing pain  unhealing ulcer  and poor circulation symptoms  a preliminary diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia is suspected. 
7,2,95,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial95,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mr. John Anderson Age: 72 years Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired construction worker  Chief Complaint:   Mr. Anderson presents at the clinic today with a 2-week history of worsening pain in both lower extremities  particularly at night  causing him numerous sleep disturbances.   History of Present Illness:  He explains that the pain mostly affects his calves and becomes more severe when walking but eases when he rests. He also reports experiencing extreme coldness in both legs  with his left foot occasionally turning a pale color. He noticed a few open sores on his feet that have not healed. He adds that he's lost a significant amount of weight over the past few weeks unknowingly.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Anderson has been a smoker for the past 50 years  with a 40 pack-year history. He has a history of type 2 diabetes for 15 years and hypertension for 20 years. He had a myocardial infarction five years ago and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. He briefly mentions that his mobility had been steadily declining over the past two years due to chronic arthritis.   Family History:  His father died of a stroke in his 80s  and his mother passed away from complications of diabetes. He has an elder brother who survived a myocardial infarction and is currently managing hypertension and diabetes.  Social History:  He is a widower who lives alone but with weekly visits from his daughter. He doesn't consume alcohol and quit smoking after his cardiac surgery. He does not engage in regular physical activity.  Review of Systems:  He denies experiencing chest pain  shortness of breath  cough  abdominal pain  or any changes in bowel or bladder function.   Physical Exam:  On examination  both legs appear pale  with cold temperature to touch especially in his left foot. Peripheral pulses are reduced in both legs. Multiple non-healing ulcers are noted on both feet  more prominent on the left foot.  Based on these findings  the working diagnosis for the patient is critical limb ischemia  and he is advised to get further diagnostic tests such as Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  Doppler ultrasound scan  angiography  and blood tests.
7,2,96,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial96,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 72-year-old African American male who presents to the clinic with complaints of extreme pain in his right lower extremity  rest pain and minor ulcers that have been persisting for the past three weeks. His pain is primarily persistent at rest and intensifies upon elevation of the limb. He also reports that the leg feels cold to touch compared to his left extremity.   He is a former smoker with a smoking history of 35 packs/year but quit 10 years ago. He has a known history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus and has been taking anti-hypertensives and oral hypoglycemic agents regularly. His family history reveals his father had peripheral artery disease and his elder brother underwent a below-knee amputation due to severe peripheral arterial disease.   He is retired and lives with his wife. He reports having trouble with mobility and his sleep is interrupted due to pain and occasional numbness. His wounds are slowly healing despite timely local care which is causing great discomfort to him.  On physical examination  he has a diminished pulse in the right lower extremity  decreased sensation along with pallor  and an ulcer on the right great toe. There are also patches of dry skin and hair loss noted on that leg. His vitals are stable and other systemic examinations are normal.
7,2,97,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial97,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Rosa Martinez is a 70-year-old Hispanic female  comes into the clinic complaining of ongoing severe and worsening pain in her right lower leg for the last 6 weeks. Ms. Martinez states she experiences this pain even while at rest and notes that her leg often feels cold to touch. The pain has been disrupting her sleep at night and has made it increasingly difficult for her to walk or participate in daily activities. She also reports noticing a non-healing wound on her right foot.  In her past medical history  Ms. Martinez has diagnosed and treatment-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. For years  she was a two pack-a-day smoker but quit ten years ago after being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore  she reveals she was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) around five years ago.   Her father had a history of heart disease and her mother was diabetic. Her family history also reveals several members with various vascular diseases.  Currently  she lives alone and is retired. She states her diet is predominantly homemade Hispanic cuisine. All these factors make her situation worth investigating for critical limb ischemia. 
7,2,98,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial98,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Smith is a 73-year-old African American male presenting with complaints of severe pain in his left lower leg and foot. The pain has been worsening over the past month and now it is bothering him even at rest at night. He mentions he's been waking up because of the pain and would have to dangle his feet over the bed to get any relief. Additionally  he's noticed that his left foot looks discolored  slightly bluish and cold. He also reports the non-healing nature of a small wound on the left big toe.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith has been a chronic smoker since his twenties and also has a known case of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 10 years  Hypertension for 18 years  and Hyperlipidemia for 15 years. He previously was diagnosed with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) 5 years earlier. He has a history of stroke with no residual deficits five years ago and coronary artery disease  with a stent placement to his left anterior descending artery three years ago.   Family History:   There is a family history of heart diseases with his father dying in his 50s from a myocardial infarction. His older brother also underwent bypass surgery at the age of 60.   Social History:   He's been retired for the past 8 years  lives with his wife  and is considerably active in the local community. Despite repeated advice  he didn't quit smoking and consumes alcohol socially. He admits to not monitoring his diet strictly and being fairly sedentary. He does not do any illicit drugs.   Current Medication:  He's been managed on Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes  Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension  and Atorvastatin 40mg daily for high cholesterol. Clopidogrel has been prescribed since his stent placement.
7,2,99,diagnosis7-prompt2-trial99,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 72-year-old African-American male named Mr. Johnson. He presents with complaints of rest pain in his left lower leg that's been worsening over the past few months. The pain is primarily in his calf and toes and it prevents him from getting sleep at night. He reports a sensation of numbness and coldness in the foot and also noticed a slowly healing non-traumatic ulcer on his big toe.  His past medical history is significant. He has severe obesity  poorly controlled type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy  and a 40-year history of heavy smoking. He also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and was diagnosed with non-obstructive coronary artery disease three years ago. Mr. Johnson has shown non-compliance with his medication regimen  largely due to financial constraints. He is not under any major psychiatric treatment but has had depressive episodes in the past.  He is retired  lives with his wife and their pet dog  and his two children live nearby. His wife mentions that the patient has limited mobility due to severe pain  and his activity is much decreased since his leg pain started. Currently  Mr. Johnson uses a walking cane but struggles with distance and stairs due to the pain.  In terms of family history  both of Mr. Johnson's parents had diabetes and his father had a history of stroke. His older sister underwent a below-knee amputation due to complications of peripheral artery disease.  This information is suggestive of a patient with critical limb ischemia  which is likely due to his peripheral artery disease  exacerbated by nicotine abuse  diabetes  and non-compliance to medication.

7,3,31,diagnosis7-prompt3-trial31,Title: A Case Study – Critical Limb Ischemia  Slide 1: Patient Introduction  Our case subject for today is Mr. X  a 68-year-old Caucasian male. He's a retired factory worker and has a past medical history of smoking  hypertension  elevated cholesterol levels  type 2 diabetes  and peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Slide 2: Initial Presentation  Mr. X first presented with severe pain in his right foot. The pain had been escalating over the past six weeks and was increasingly noticeable even when at rest or during the night. He mentioned it was effectively disturbing his sleep. He also reported noticing a wound on his right foot that has been slow in healing than normal.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mr. X has been a smoker for 40 years and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension 15 years ago  conditions for which he has been undergoing irregular treatment. He was diagnosed with Peripheral Artery Disease 3 years ago with symptoms primarily manifesting as intermittent claudication.  Slide 4: Clinical Examination & Diagnosis  Upon examination  his right foot was colder compared to the other & showed color changes. There was a noticeable absence of pulse and the presence of a non-healing ulcer on the foot. An Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) test along with Doppler ultrasonography confirmed the poor vascular circulation & reduced blood flow to the limb. Angiography further corroborated the diagnosis  highlighting significant blockages in the arterial supply to his right lower limb. This led to the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Slide 5: Treatment & Management  The severity of his CLI necessitated a two-pronged approach: handling the present severe symptoms and managing the underlying disease processes. Initially  Mr. X underwent a successful angioplasty  which was aimed at re-establishing the blood flow. Post-procedure  he was prescribed anti-platelets and statins to further combat the PAD. Pain management was done with analgesics and efficiently controlled. Apart from this  his hypertension and diabetes were managed more stringently  and he was also put on a smoking cessation program.  Slide 6: Current Status and Prognosis  Three months post-treatment  Mr. X reports a significant reduction in pain and a healed foot ulcer. He’s managed to control his diabetes and hypertension more effectively and has made strides towards smoking cessation. The long-term prognosis is a function of the management of underlying health conditions.   Slide 7: Conclusion   This case illustrates the complex interplay between multiple comorbidities resulting in critical limb ischemia. Early identification  aggressive management of the causative factors  and timely intervention can drastically improve the outcomes and quality of life in individuals affected by CLI.

He was also diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 3 years ago. He has been on regular medication for all these conditions but admits inconsistency in medication adherence and lifestyle modifications.  Slide 4: Current Medical Issue The patient presented with severe rest pain in his right lower limb which had intensified over a week  along with skin discoloration and the development of non-healing ulcer over his right foot.   Slide 5: Diagnosis  Given the patient's history and presenting complaints  a working diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia was considered. This was later confirmed through an examination and diagnostic tests  including an Ankle-brachial Index (ABI) and Doppler ultrasound showing severely reduced blood flow.  Slide 6: Treatment Plan Immediately upon diagnosis  aggressive management was initiated to control pain and any concomitant infection present due to the non-healing ulcer. Long term management involves cessation of smoking  intensive lifestyle modifications  optimal control of diabetes and hypertension. Medical treatment includes anti-platelet drugs  Statins and Cilostazol. Revascularisation by endovascular intervention or bypass surgery is also considered to restore blood flow to the limb and prevent amputation.

7,3,63,diagnosis7-prompt3-trial63,Title: A Case Study on Critical Limb Ischemia  Slide 1: Introduction This presentation outlines a case involving a 68-year-old African-American female in the context of critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Slide 2: Patient Background The patient is a retired school teacher. She is obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 34 kg/m2 and is a smoker with a 30-pack-year smoking history. She was previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and controlled hypertension. In addition  the patient has a family history of peripheral artery disease.  Slide 3: Present Illness The patient presented with a six-month history of worsening leg pain in her right lower extremity while walking which typically subsides with rest. Over the past month  she has been experiencing rest pain  particularly at night  and has noticed a non-healing ulcer on her right great toe.   Slide 4: Physical Examination Physical examination revealed a shallow  painful ulcer with dry gangrene on distal phalanx of the right great toe. Pulses in the right foot were diminished  and foot temperature was reduced compared to the contralateral limb.   Slide 5: Investigations & Diagnosis An Ankle-brachial index (ABI) showed readings of 0.5 on the right and 1.1 on the left. A Doppler ultrasound confirmed severe stenosis in the right femoral and popliteal arteries. These findings are consistent with critical limb ischemia  Rutherford Classification category 4.  Slide 6: Management The patient consented to revascularization therapy. A successful right femoropopliteal bypass was performed. In addition to this  she was prescribed antiplatelets  statin therapy  and pain relief was managed using opioids. Patient was also advised for lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation  weight loss  and diabetes management.  Slide 7: Follow-Up Post procedure  the patient showed significant improvement in symptoms. At a 3-month follow-up visit  her ulcer had healed  her rest pain had resolved  and her right foot pulses were palpable.   Slide 8: Conclusion Timely identification and intervention can significantly improve outcomes in patients with CLI. Comprehensive management consists of revascularization  cardiovascular risk factor modification  and symptomatic treatment. The benefit of these measures is seen with the patient's improved symptoms at follow-up.

7,3,74,diagnosis7-prompt3-trial74,Title: A Case Study on Critical Limb Ischemia  Slide 1: Introduction A review of a case involving a 65-year-old African-American male patient who presented with critical limb ischemia.   Slide 2: Demographic Information The patient is a retired factory worker  aged 65  living in an urban area. He is a non-drinker and non-smoker. He has a family history of diabetes and hypertension.  Slide 3: Medical Background The patient has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension  both diagnosed 10 years ago. He has been managing his diabetes with oral medications and diet modifications. Hypertension was controlled by ACE inhibitors.   Slide 4: Current Medical Issue  The patient was admitted due to worsening pain in his right lower extremity which had been ongoing for the past three months. Despite analgesics  the pain intensified making it hard for him to perform daily tasks. Pain was notably more severe at rest and at night.   Slide 5: Examination and Diagnosis Upon physical examination  the right foot was pale  cold to the touch with diminished pulses. Wounds were evident in the distal part of the same limb. An arterial Doppler study confirmed decrease in ankle-brachial index. Diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was confirmed based on history  clinical findings and investigations.  Slide 6: Treatment Plan Due to the severity of ischemia  patient was referred for revascularization procedures - angioplasty with stent implantation. Post intervention  patient received antiplatelets  anticoagulants and statins therapy. Further wound care  glycemic control  and blood pressure management were also addressed.   Slide 7: Prognosis and Follow-up CLI is a severe condition with significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly identified and treated. The goal of the treatment is not only limb salvage  but also pain relief and improved quality of life. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor the healing process and to ensure medical management for his comorbid conditions are optimal.

Slide 2: Demographic Information Mrs. Wilson is a retired school teacher living with her husband in a suburban neighborhood. She has a 45-pack-year smoking history and an overall sedentary lifestyle. She does not consume alcohol or use illicit substances.   Slide 3: Past Medical History Mrs. Wilson has a significant medical history: diagnosed with Type II Diabetes 8 years ago  currently uncontrolled; Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia  both managed with medication; and a history of transient ischemic attacks. No known drug allergies.   Slide 4: Previous Surgical History She underwent total knee replacement surgery on her right knee 4 years ago  followed by physiotherapy and rehabilitation. No other significant surgical history is present.  Slide 5: Recent Symptomatology Recently  Mrs. Wilson noticed unbearable pain in her right leg  particularly at rest  and a wound on her foot that refuses to heal. Pain is exacerbated by short-distance walks  and relieved only by hanging her leg at the bedside.  Slide 6: Physical Examination On examination  her right foot appeared pale and cold with an ulcerated wound at the plantar aspect of her forefoot. Lower limb pulses were weak  and distal sensation was reduced.   Slide 7: Investigations Vascular studies including Duplex ultrasound and angiography confirm the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. Laboratory tests highlight uncontrolled blood glucose levels and increased blood pressure.  Slide 8: Diagnosis The clinical context  along with investigative reports  confirmed Mrs. Wilson's condition as Critical Limb Ischemia  secondary to atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease  significantly influenced by her uncontrolled diabetes  smoking  and sedentary lifestyle.  Slide 9: Treatment Plan Given her age and comorbidities  revascularization through endovascular procedures will be considered initially  aimed at pain relief and prevention of limb amputation. Concurrently  aggressive risk factor modification will be employed  which includes optimizing glucose control  antihypertensive therapy  lipid-lowering agents  cessation of smoking  and guideline-directed antiplatelet therapy.  Slide 10: Conclusion This case illustrates the complexities of diagnosing and managing vascular complications in geriatric diabetic patients. Proper risk stratification  aggressive management of modifiable risk factors  and appropriate therapeutic intervention can notably improve quality of life in such patients.

He had a myocardial infarction 7 years ago and had a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) to manage his ischemic heart disease. He has been experiencing symptoms of intermittent claudication for the past year.  Slide 4: Presenting Complaints The patient arrived at the clinic with excruciating pain in his left foot which had been worsening over several weeks  disturbing his sleep even at rest. He revealed a non-healing wound on his left great toe which he had noticed around four months ago.  Slide 5: Examination Findings Clinically  his lower left leg was found to be cold with weak or absent peripheral pulses. The skin of his foot showed signs of mottling and the toe wound showed tissue necrosis indicative of gangrene.  Slide 6: Diagnosis  Diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was confirmed with abdominal ultrasound  ankle-brachial index  and CT angiography showing multi-level peripheral arterial disease with infra-popliteal disease being predominant.  Slide 7: Treatment & Prognosis Treatment includes aggressive management of modifiable risk factors  pain management  wound care  revascularization procedures  or in severe cases  amputation. Early intervention and aggressive treatment can improve prognosis and limb salvage.  Slide 8: Conclusion  Our patient's past history of smoking  diabetes  heart disease  and his advanced age put him at a higher risk of developing CLI. This case highlights the importance of comprehensive management of CLI that involves risk factor modification  timely diagnosis  and appropriate intervention.  Slide 9: Questions? Inviting any questions/comments from the audience.
7,3,82,diagnosis7-prompt3-trial82,Slide 1: Introduction Today's case study covers a patient suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which drastically reduces blood flow to the extremities  primarily the legs and feet  and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 78-year-old African American male  retired construction worker  living in an urban residential setting. He is a nonsmoker and refrains from alcohol. His Body Mass Index (BMI) is 29  classifying him as borderline obese.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a significant past medical history - he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) twenty years ago. He was also diagnosed with hypertension fifteen years ago  and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) ten years ago. Despite consistent efforts to manage these conditions  his health has been progressively deteriorating.   Slide 4: Medications  The patient is currently on Metformin to control T2DM  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Aspirin daily as prescribed by the cardiologist due to his PAD. Medication compliance is generally good  as confirmed by his primary care physician.   Slide 5: Recent Symptoms The patient reported experiencing severe pain at rest in his right lower limb for the past three weeks. He also pointed out a non-healing ulcer on the big toe of his right foot  which appeared about three months ago. As these symptoms are consistent with late-stage PAD or Critical Limb Ischemia  he was referred for vascular consultation.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Procedures Initial evaluation through palpation revealed absent pedal (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial) pulses in his right foot. A diagnostic duplex ultrasound was done  demonstrating significant stenosis in the distal right superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery  supporting the diagnosis of CLI.   Slide 7: Conclusion The important lesson from this case is the significance of long-term management and follow-up in patients suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension  as neglected PAD has led to critical limb ischemia in this patient. A multidisciplinary approach including aggressive risk factor modifications  revascularization  and wound care management will be crucial in the proposed treatment plan to prevent limb loss.  Slide 8: Future Considerations There is a need for increased focus on public health intervention  patient education  and periodic surveillance to reduce the burden of CLI. This includes promoting healthy lifestyles  early diagnosis of PAD in high-risk individuals  and the optimal use of current treatment options.

7,3,95,diagnosis7-prompt3-trial95,Slide 1: Introduction Good day everyone. Today  we will be discussing a case involving a patient suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of blood flow in the arteries of lower extremities which could potentially lead to amputation if not managed properly.  Slide 2: Demographics & Presentation Our patient is Mr. J. Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian male who came to us with severe and consistent leg pain  which gets worse when lying down but improves when hanging the leg off the edge of the bed. He also reported a non-healing sore on his left foot.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Smith is a retired mechanic who admits to smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years prior and hypertensive for 15 years but has been inconsistent with his medication regimen. He also had bypass surgery for coronary artery disease 5 years ago.  Slide 4: Examination Upon physical examination  the skin of Mr. Smith’s left foot appears pale and cold with a noticeable lack of pulse. There is a noticeable gangrenous wound on the sole and his foot is noted to have intermittent claudication.  Slide 5: Diagnosis These signs and symptoms spot the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia. To confirm  we proceeded to a vascular ultrasound  which reveals severely reduced blood flow to the lower left extremity.  Slide 6: Intervention  Considering Mr. Smith's history and the severity of CLI  a thorough discussion was made regarding the choices of management- Lifestyle modifications  endovascular intervention or bypass surgery. He was given smoking cessation counseling and consistent medication compliance was emphasized to stabilize his diabetes and hypertension.  Slide 7: Conclusion Mr. Smith's case demonstrates the importance of holistic patient management  encompassing not only medical and surgical treatment but also lifestyle modification. Early detection and treatment of CLI can significantly increase the patient's quality of life and decrease the risk of amputation. 
7,3,96,diagnosis7-prompt3-trial96,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia: A Case Discussion  Slide 1: Introduction to Critical Limic Ischemia Critical limb ischemia is a severe obstruction of the arteries which considerably reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of causing severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our case involves a 72-year-old Hispanic male who is a retired truck driver. He has resided in Chicago  Illinois  for the past five decades.   Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a significant past medical history that includes type 2 diabetes Mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He was a heavy smoker but quit smoking 10 years ago.  Slide 4: Presenting Symptoms His primary complaints are progressive claudication  pain in his lower left leg  and non-healing ulcers on the left foot. He reports worsening pain  especially during the night  which affects his sleep.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Investigations  Angiography shows significant atherosclerotic disease in the left tibial and peroneal arteries. He has an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.4 on the left and 1.0 on the right. There is evidence of multiple small non-healing ulcers on his left foot and left lower leg on physical examination.  Slide 6: Diagnosis  Given the patient's severe symptoms  history of poor risk factor control  notable differences between the right and left ABI  and results of angiography  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia is established.  Slide 7: Management Plan  The management plan proposed includes medical therapies and surgical interventions. Antiplatelet and statin therapies are indicated to prevent thrombosis and lower cholesterol levels. Referral to a vascular surgeon for consideration of revascularization for limb salvage has been made. Glycemic control and further smoking cessation intervention should also be addressed.  Slide 8: Conclusion  This case underlines the importance of early diagnosis and comprehensive management in patients with peripheral artery disease  especially in those at high risk of progression to critical limb ischemia. Optimizing management of modifiable risk factors is key to improving patient prognosis.

Slide 3: Presenting Complaints The patient reported progressive pain in his lower limbs  especially right leg  particularly at night and while walking minimal distances. Resting leg pain has been present for the past three weeks.  Slide 4: Symptoms The patient complains of color changes in leg  significant hair loss  ulcers  and sores on his right foot that doesn’t heal  severe weight loss.   Slide 5: Previous Interventions The patient was initially treated with oral medications for peripheral artery disease and pain  with unsatisfactory results.    Slide 6: Physical Examination Upon examination  the right foot was noticeably cooler to touch than left  bulging veins were observed. Pulse in right leg was weak compared to left.   Slide 7: Diagnostic Assessments Performed tests: Ankle-brachial index  Doppler ultrasound  Angiogram. Test results showed greatly reduced blood flow in the right leg  associated with atherosclerotic blockages.  Slide 8: Clinical Diagnosis Based on symptoms  physical examination findings  and diagnostic tests  the patient was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe form of peripheral arterial disease.  Slide 9: Treatment Plan The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for further management. Surgical interventions such as angioplasty  bypass surgery  and thrombolysis were considered according to current guidelines. Amputation may be considered as a last resort.  Slide 10: Conclusion This case exemplifies the importance of early detection of peripheral arterial disease and the necessity for aggressive treatment in preventing progression to CLI  reducing morbidity and mortality.

He also confirms experiencing occasional palpitations. There is a 30-pack year history of smoking. The patient denies drug use. He is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife who is his primary caregiver. His father passed away due to myocardial infarction and his mother was diabetic. On examination  left lower limb pulses  including dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis are not palpable. There is mottling and coldness observed on the distal left lower leg and foot with an approximately 3 cm ulcer showing signs of infection and necrosis on the dorsal aspect of the left foot. Rest of the physical and neurological examination is normal. Initial investigations reveal elevated HbA1c and mildly elevated white cell count. The patient's problem represents critical limb ischemia  likely secondary to peripheral arterial disease with a possible superimposed infection.
7,5,26,diagnosis7-prompt5-trial26,A 70-year-old male patient  with a known medical history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2)  hyperlipidemia  and chronic heavy tobacco use  presents with a 2-week story of pain in his left lower leg at rest. The pain worsens at night causing sleep disturbances and is associated with discoloration (pale when elevated and purple-red upon dependency)  coolness of the foot  and non-healing ulcers on the toes. On physical examination  there were absent pulses in the left foot and diminished popliteal pulses on the same side. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is less than 0.5 on the left lower extremity  confirming reduced blood flow. This symptom complex suggests the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.
7,5,27,diagnosis7-prompt5-trial27,An 80-year-old female with a history of uncontrolled Type II diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial disease  now presenting with intense rest pain in her left lower extremity. She describes the pain as continuous and more severe at night. Her pain has been escalating over the past week. Physical examination reveals an absence of dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses in the affected limb and dry gangrene on the left foot. The limb is cold to touch  and she also reports that she is unable to lift her left foot at the ankle suggesting possible peripheral neuropathy. The patient has intermittent claudication (pain while walking) over the past three months  suggesting the presence of long standing arterial insufficiency. She also has episodes of non-healing ulcers over the past two months. Her other significant medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
7,5,28,diagnosis7-prompt5-trial28,Patient is a 69-year-old Hispanic male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  and smoking  presents with non-healing ulcers on the dorsum of his left foot for approximately 3 weeks. The patient experiences pronounced rest pain  particularly at night. The pain is described as a continuous  severe burning sensation that extends from the heel to the toes that gets slightly relieved on dangling his foot. On physical examination  there is noticeable hair loss on the distal portion of the leg and the dorsum of the foot. The foot feels cold to touch and peripheries are cyanotic with absent pedal pulses. The wound on the dorsum appears full-thickness with a necrotic base  surrounding epidermal detachment  and foul-smelling discharge suggestive of potential infection. He has been experiencing intermittent claudication over the last year during moderate to high-intensity walking activities that subsided at rest. There is a major concern for critical limb ischemia.
7,5,29,diagnosis7-prompt5-trial29,A 68-year-old Caucasian male with a medical history significant for type 2 diabetes and hypertension presents with persistent pain in the right lower leg. The patient notes the pain has been becoming gradually worse over the last 3 weeks and is now associated with rest pain  particularly at night  and non-healing ulcers on his right foot. On further inquiry  he admits to being a former smoker with 30 pack years history  who quit 5 years back. Physical exam reveals a cold right lower leg with diminished peripheral pulses and cyanosis. The right foot shows a black discoloration in the toe regions. Both the ABI and Doppler ultrasound support a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.
7,5,30,diagnosis7-prompt5-trial30,A 67-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for smoking  uncontrolled hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with severe resting pain in his right foot for the past 1 week. The patient also reports rapid progression of tissue loss on his foot over the last 4 days characterized by dry gangrene on the right hallux. He also describes intermittent claudication occurring at less than half a block  which has led to significant difficulty in walking. He denies any chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  but admits to poor glycemic control and adhering poorly to his antihypertensive medication. His family history is significant for peripheral artery disease (PAD) in a brother. On physical exam  the right lower extremity is cold to touch from mid-calf down  pulses are non-palpable in the right foot  and there is a black discoloration of the right hallux. This presentation is consistent with right lower extremity critical limb ischemia  possibly secondary to severe peripheral artery disease.
7,5,31,diagnosis7-prompt5-trial31,A 67-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  peripheral artery disease (PAD)  and 40-pack year smoking history  presents with severe rest pain in the right lower extremity that has progressively worsened over the past two weeks.

He states that the pain is primarily located in his foot and becomes worse at night  making sleep challenging. Upon further investigation  the patient also reports ulceration on his right toe  which has shown no healing progress within their period of appearance. He experiences a loss of sensation and a marked decrease in the temperature of the right foot compared to the left. He denies episodes of fever  chills or any systemic symptoms. On physical examination  there's a notable absence of the right pedal pulse. Previous management of his ailments includes daily oral antidiabetic and antihypertensive medication  along with prescribed statins for high cholesterol and attempts at smoking cessation. The patient's uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension  along with his history of hyperlipidemia and significant smoking history  make him a high-risk candidate for peripheral artery disease with current critical limb ischemia.
7,5,36,diagnosis7-prompt5-trial36,A 72-year-old African American male with a past medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Peripheral Arterial Disease  previous tobacco use  and Hypertension  presents with severe rest pain in his right foot and two non-healing ulcers  one on his right foot and the other at the lateral surface of the right lower leg. He reports a progressive worsening of the pain  especially at night. He also notes an intermittent claudication distance of less than 100 meters and persistent coldness of the right lower extremity with associated numbness and paresthesia.

The pain  initially only present during periods of physical activity  has become consistent even at rest. The patient has also expressed concern over the noticeable paleness and coldness of the affected limb.   Medical History:  Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has a 10 year history of type II diabetes that he manages through a combination of diet  physical activity and oral medication. His recent HbA1c was 7.5%.  Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): Diagnosed 5 years ago  it has been managed with lifestyle changes and medication.  Hyperlipidemia: Patient has a history of high cholesterol levels managed through diet and medication.  Smoking: Patient is a former smoker. He quit 6 years ago but has a 30-pack year history of smoking.   Family history: There is a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 72 and his brother has angina pectoris.  Previous Surgeries: Patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) about 8 years ago.  Risk Factors: The patient's type II diabetes  history of PAD  hyperlipidemia and personal and family history of heart disease put him at a higher risk for conditions like critical limb ischemia.  Allergies: The patient has no known drug allergies.  Current Medications: He is currently taking Metformin for diabetes  Atorvastatin for cholesterol and Aspirin for his PAD.  Review of Systems: General - significant weight loss over last 6 months  Cardiovascular - intermittent claudication  Respiratory - No issues  GI - no issues  Musculoskeletal - pain in lower extremities  Integumentary - paleness and coldness of lower right extremity  Neurological - no issues.  Physical Examination: BP- 140/85mmHg  PR-80/mt  SPO2- 96%. Cold and pale right lower limb  delayed capillary refilling time in right foot and diminished sensation. Pulses in right leg reduced.  Impression: Based on the symptoms  clinical findings  and history  the patient is highly suspected for critical limb ischemia. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) test  ultrasound and angiogram are recommended for definitive diagnosis.
7,6,7,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial7,Problem Representation:  Patient Presentation:  A 72-year-old Caucasian male patient presents with a chief complaint of severe pain and numbness in his right lower extremity for the past two weeks. The pain intensifies upon elevation and at rest. He has visible non-healing ulceration on his right foot. He also reports that his right foot becomes particularly pale when he elevates his leg and adopts a dusky hue when his leg is in a dependent position. He mentions that he has lost some weight and his appetite in the last month.  Demographic Information:  - Age: 72 years - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian  - Occupation: Retired salesman  Past Medical History:  - Diabetes mellitus type II diagnosed 18 years ago - Hypertension diagnosed six years ago - Hyperlipidemia diagnosed five years ago - 40 pack-year smoking history - History of peripheral arterial disease diagnosed around three years ago  for which he underwent angioplasty in the right leg.  - He is currently on metformin  lisinopril and atorvastatin.  The above-mentioned representation is a typical example of a patient with critical limb ischemia (CLI). CLI is a severe form of peripheral arterial disease  and it occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked. This condition is associated with various risks including non-healing sores or gangrene  which may eventually lead to amputation. It's notable that this patient has several risk factors for CLI e.g. age  gender  race  diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking.

Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed at the age of 50 years. Patient has been on oral hypoglycemic agents. His glycemic control has been suboptimal. 3. Dyslipidemia: Diagnosed at the age of 54 years. Patient is on statins for the control of cholesterol. 4. Coronary Heart Disease: The patient had an apparent ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) at age 57  for which he underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. 5. Tobacco Use: The patient has been a chronic smoker for the past 40 years  averaging about 10-15 cigarettes a day. 6. Family History: Patient’s father died due to a heart attack. His mother had type II diabetes and hypertension.  Presenting Symptoms:   1. Critical Limb Ischemia: In the past few weeks  John has been experiencing severe pain in his right lower limb  particularly in the foot (rest pain). The pain is worse at night and eases slightly when he dangles the leg off the side of his bed. 2. Distal Ulcerations: He noticed the development of non-healing ulcers  particularly on the tips of his right foot and calf. 3. The right lower limb is cold compared to the left. He has also noticed changes in the color of his foot  sometimes appearing bluish (cyanosis). 4. There is absence of pedal pulse on the right foot. 5. Other Symptoms: John has also experienced episodes of unexplained tiredness  mild chest pain during exertion and occasional blurring of vision.  This patient has a significant history of cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension  diabetes  dyslipidemia  coronary artery disease and chronic tobacco use which predispose him to Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) leading to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). His symptoms of rest pain  distal ulcerations and absence of pulse are characteristic of CLI. His current condition may require aggressive treatment  such as surgical intervention  to establish revascularization and avoid potential limb loss.
7,6,9,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial9,Problem Representation:  Patient Description:  A 67-year-old African American male  former 30-pack year smoker  with a known medical history significant for Type II diabetes mellitus and severe peripheral artery disease presents with severe rest pain  non-healing wounds on the left lower extremity.  Symptoms:   The patient reports a dull ache and burning sensation in his left calf and foot for the past month  which becomes especially intense during hours of sleep. He also mentions a non-healing ulcer on the left heel and dark discoloration of the toes associated with weight loss and muscle wasting.   Medical History:   He has a past medical history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus poorly controlled with Metformin and diet  non-compliance with medication due to financial constraints  Severe Peripheral Artery Disease treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty 7 years ago. Additionally  he has a long history of tobacco use and sedentary lifestyle but reports quitting smoking 3 years ago.  Medications:   Metformin  Aspirin  Multivitamin supplements.   Family History:   His mother deceased due to a heart attack at mid-sixties and father from cerebral stroke at early seventies. He also mentions a brother who recently underwent a limb amputation for a similar reason.   Social History:   He lives alone in an urban area and worked as a truck driver before retiring. He has one son and one daughter  both live separately. He denies alcohol/drug use.  Physical Examination:   On examination  he has a thin body habitus  is not in acute distress. The left lower extremity is cold to touch  and there are decreased pulses in the left popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial arteries. A non-healing ulcer with a necrotic base is noted on the left heel and gangrenous changes were observed on the left toes. The rest of the physical examination is normal.   This patient's problem of non-healing wounds and severe pain at rest in the left lower limb  in the presence of peripheral artery disease and diabetes Mellitus  can be represented as Critical Limb Ischemia.
7,6,10,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial10,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 67 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired military officer Marital Status: Married Address: 7246 Brush Boulevard  New York  NY Insurance: Medicare  Presenting Problem: John presents with severe and recurrent pain in his right lower limb. This has been ongoing for about two months and he initially assumed it was related to gout for which he has a history. However  the pain has drastically increased over the last two weeks  mainly at rest and during the night. The pain has been impairing his capacity to carry out daily activities and sleep properly.  Relevant Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension - diagnosed fifteen years ago  currently controlled on medication. 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - diagnosed seven years ago. 3. Gout - diagnosed ten years ago  experiences occasional flares. 4. Smoker  about a pack/day  for the past forty years. 5. History of high cholesterol and triglycerides. 6. Myocardial infarction experienced five years ago. 7. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery following the heart attack.  Family History:  1. Father had a history of heart disease and diabetes. 2. Mother passed away due to stroke  also had a history of diabetes. 3. Older brother had peripheral artery disease.  In summary  John is a 67-year-old male with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease  including a personal medical history of Type 2 Diabetes  hypertension  gout  high cholesterol  smoking  and a previous myocardial infarction with follow-up surgery. He also has a family history of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Symptoms of critical limb ischemia can't be overlooked in this case.
7,6,11,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial11,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 69-year-old African American male presents with progressive pain in both legs at rest and non-healing ulcers on the distal aspect of the left foot for the last five months.  Demographic Details: The patient is a smoker with a 40-pack year history and has been a chronic alcoholic for more than 15 years. He is retired and has led a sedentary lifestyle for over two decades. He lives alone in a one-bedroom apartment and is dependent on social services. He has a limited support system with only one daughter who lives in another state. The patient's nutritional status is poor.  Relevant Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type II about ten years ago and hypertension five years ago. He has a history of chronic kidney disease (stage III) recognized two years back. In the last five years  he has developed signs of peripheral arterial disease  which remained untreated due to the patient's socioeconomic conditions and lack of awareness. He was on oral hypoglycemic agents  antihypertensives  lipid-lowering medications  and has been regular on his dialysis sessions.  From a cardiovascular perspective  he had a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) three years ago  managed conservatively due to his high risk for intervention. He has been in NYHA functional class II congestive heart failure (CHF) since his NSTEMI. There is a known history of mild intermittent claudication over the last two years.  Examination:  Physical examination reveals weak peripheral pulses in both lower limbs  more so in the left  and a non-healing ulcer with signs of infection on the left foot. Dry scaly skin with hair loss on both lower limbs is noted. Cardiac auscultation reveals a systolic murmur. There are no notable findings on the chest and abdominal examination.  Problem Statement:  The patient's presenting complaint  progressive rest pain in both legs  non-healing ulcers  physical findings  and background medical conditions indicate a case of Critical Limb Ischemia likely due to advanced Peripheral Arterial Disease exacerbated by poorly controlled diabetes  hypertension  smoking  and chronic kidney disease. His overall prognosis is poor due to his advanced age  severe comorbidities  socio-economic struggles  and lifestyle choices. Personalized management strategies  considering all these challenges  needs to be implemented.
7,6,12,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial12,Problem Representation:  A 68-year-old African-American male with a long history of smoking  dyslipidemia  hypertension  and poorly controlled diabetes  presents with complaints of severe pain in the lower right limb. The pain aggravates with physical activity and occasionally disturbs his sleep.  On further inquiry  he mentions experiencing intermittent claudication  progression to resting pain and persistent wounds on the foot that haven't healed for several months.   On physical examination  there is a notable absence of pulses in the right lower limb  hair loss  patchy areas of skin discoloration  and presence of non-healing ulcers on the foot.   The above symptoms suggest a diagnosis consistent with critical limb ischemia. The patient's potential risk factors include his race  age  smoking history  dyslipidemia  hypertension  and uncontrolled diabetes. His clinical signs such as intermittent claudication progressing to rest pain  non-healing wounds  and absence of pulses further support the diagnosis. The next step would be to conduct appropriate tests and radiological imaging  such as arterial Doppler ultrasound  to confirm the preliminary diagnosis and severity of the condition.   In the patient's past medical history  it is vital to note any history of peripheral artery disease  cerebrovascular disease  coronary artery disease or any prior surgical revascularization or angioplasty procedures  as these could influence disease management and prognosis.
7,6,13,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial13,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 67  Gender: Male  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Postman Lifestyle: Smoker (40 pack years)  sedentary  Address: New York  USA Contact: (555)-123-4567 Referrer: Local Physician  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Patient has been suffering from hypertension for the past 10 years  controlled with antihypertensive medication.  2. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Patient has a 15 years history of diabetes. It is moderately controlled with oral hypoglycemics.  3. Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD): Diagnosed with PAD 5 years ago  has been on conservative management since.  4. Previous myocardial infarction: Patient had a heart attack 7 years ago. Post MI  he has been on antiplatelet drugs.  5. High cholesterol: The patient has had elevated cholesterol for around 10 years  managed with statins.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient reports a 6 months history of severe  constant pain in his right lower leg  especially in the foot  even while resting. He also complains of non-healing ulcers on his right foot and discoloration of the toes. The symptoms have been progressively worsening over time. He reports the pain is occasionally intense enough to wake him from sleep at night.  Possible Diagnosis:  Considering the medical history and current symptoms  John Doe seems to have critical limb ischemia. An arterial Doppler ultrasound and angiogram may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and decide on the best course of treatment.  Plan:  John's case needs urgent attention as Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) can lead to limb amputation if not treated promptly. He should refrain from smoking and improve his physical activity level (as tolerable)  which could help in improving his condition. Furthermore  his blood pressure  diabetes and cholesterol should be managed more aggressively. A surgical consultation for possible angioplasty or bypass surgery should be arranged based on the assessment of his angiogram.

Investigations indicate poor blood flow in the right lower extremity (Ankle Brachial Index: 0.4  Normal >0.9)  Diagnosis: Based on the above information  patient is diagnosed with critical limb ischemia of the right leg  secondary to severely blocked arteries and poor blood flow  exacerbated by underlying diabetes  hypertension  and smoking history.   Treatment Plan: Conservative management including optimization of cardiovascular risk factors (blood sugar control  blood pressure management  lipid modification  smoking cessation).   Consideration for aggressive treatment strategies such as endovascular revascularization or surgical bypass if symptoms do not improve or progress.   It is important that the patient understands the gravity of the situation and the need for compliance with medication and lifestyle changes.
7,6,24,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial24,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Demographic Information: A 68-year-old Caucasian male patient. - Occupation: A retired construction worker. - Lifestyle: History of heavy smoking for the last 40 years and excessive alcohol consumption. Living a sedentary lifestyle with poor dietary habits. - Family History: Significant for heart disease and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in immediate family members.  Presenting Problem:  The patient is chiefly complaining of severe pain in the right lower leg that has progressively worsened over the last few weeks. The pain typically increases when he is lying down and somewhat relieved when he hangs his leg over the side of the bed. He also reports non-healing ulcer on the right foot and intermittent claudication. There has been a change in color of the limb and the patient has been noticing his right leg becoming colder in comparison to the left one.  Medical History:  1. Chronic Diseases: Long-standing hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Additionally  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease 2 years ago. 2. Surgical History: Underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 5 years ago after being diagnosed with severe coronary artery disease. 3. Medication: Taking metformin for diabetes  atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia  and aspirin for preventing heart attack. 4. Allergies: No known drug allergies.  From this information  it can be inferred that this patient is suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which prominently reduces blood flow to the extremities (arms  feet  or legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and even skin ulcers or sores. This is most likely due to his peripheral artery disease which could have been further exacerbated by his diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and lifestyle factors.

7,6,26,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial26,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents to the hospital.  Presenting Disease:  The patient reports experiencing intermittent claudication  characterized by pain in his right leg when walking that subsides when at rest. He describes the pain as aching  cramping  or a sense of fatigue in his muscles. Over the last few weeks  he has noticed a progressive non-healing wound on his right foot and increased pain even at rest. The pain is severe enough to prevent him from sleeping. He also reports noticeable weight loss. Given these symptoms  a primary clinical concern is critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Relevant Past Medical History: Patient has a 20-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure. He was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) five years ago  and has been on aspirin and statin therapy since then. Despite these interventions  his condition has progressively worsened. He has been a heavy smoker for the past 50 years. There is no known family history of cardiovascular diseases  strokes  or peripheral artery disease.   Patient's history of diabetes  hypertensions  smoking  and his advanced age places him at increased risk for developing critical limb ischemia resulting from progression of peripheral arterial disease. His condition points to the need for urgent intervention to restore blood supply and avoid possible amputation.

7,6,29,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial29,Patient Information: - Name: John Doe - Age: 68 years - Gender: Male - Race: African American - Occupation: Retired truck driver - Marital Status: Married  - Residence: Urban  living alone  Medical History: - Smoking history: 30 pack-years - Alcohol consumption: Occasional drinker - No known drug allergies - Chronic conditions: Diabetes mellitus (type 2  diagnosed 15 years ago)  Hypertension (diagnosed 20 years ago) - Previous surgeries: Cholecystectomy (gall bladder removal  10 years ago)  Current Medications: - Metformin: 500 mg twice daily for diabetes - Lisinopril: 10mg daily for hypertension  Family History: - Paternal: Died of myocardial infarction  aged 65 - Maternal: Hypertension  - Siblings: One brother with coronary artery disease  Presenting Complaint: Patient is presenting with a 3-month history of pain in lower left limb  especially when walking  indicating intermittent claudication. He reports non-healing wounds on his foot and decreased temperature of the affected limb compared to the other limb. His condition has progressively worsened over the past 2 weeks with severe pain even at rest  suggesting the development of critical limb ischemia (CLI). There are no signs of fever or systemic illness  and peripheral pulses are not palpable in the affected limb.  Conclusion: Considering the patient's demographic information  medical history  and presenting complaint  an assessment for peripheral arterial disease and critical limb ischemia is warranted. Diabetes and smoking are significant risk factors  and he has symptoms suggestive of severe  progressive ischemia in the affected limb. These symptoms warrant immediate intervention to alleviate pain  heal the wounds  and prevent further limb loss and potential cardiovascular complications. The patient should be referred urgently to a vascular specialist for further evaluation and proposed vascular intervention. Management should also involve aggressive risk factor control  including smoking cessation and strict glycemic control. His family doctor should be informed and involved in managing his chronic medical conditions.
7,6,30,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial30,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Gender: Male Age: 65 years old Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Retired construction worker Body Mass Index: 30 kg/m² (obese) Living Status: Lives with aged wife in urban setting  Medical History: Smoking: Chronic heavy smoker for 40 years (2 packs per day) Alcohol: Moderate drinker (2-3 drinks per week) Drugs: None  Past Medical History (PMH) 1) Hypertension (HTN): Diagnosed at the age of 50  on antihypertensive drugs. 2) Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Diagnosed at the age of 55  irregular blood sugar control. 3) Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed at the age of 58  on statins. 4) Coronary artery disease (CAD): Diagnosed at age 60  managed with medication and dietary changes.  Surgical History: 1) Appendectomy at the age of 30.  Family History: 1) Father had peripheral artery disease. 2) Mother died from Acute Myocardial Infarction. 3) Two brothers  one with diabetes and another with HTN.  Presenting Problem: The patient has been experiencing severe pain in his right leg  even when resting  for the past two weeks. Pain is so severe that it's affecting his sleep and daily routine. There are non-healing ulcers on his right foot  and the foot often feels cold.  Investigations: The ankle-brachial index  an objective physical examination done to diagnose the patient  was very low (less than 0.4)  confirming severe limb ischemia. Ultrasound showed markedly reduced blood flow in the right leg.  Diagnosis: Critical limb ischemia.  Plan: Given the severity of the limb ischemia  emergent vascular consultation and potential intervention will be sought  with ongoing monitoring and symptomatic relief with pain management. Continuation of medications for associated conditions including hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes. It's essential to discuss smoking cessation  healthy diet and other lifestyle modifications.
7,6,31,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial31,Patient Information:   - Age: 62 years - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: African American  - Occupation: Retired electrician - Residence: Urban   Presenting Problem:   The patient has come in complaining of severe pain in his left lower limb which is present even during rest. He has also noticed a slowing healing sore on his left foot.  Past Medical History:   1. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient has been living with diabetes for 20 years with sub-optimal glycemic control  and is currently on metformin and insulin therapy.  2. Hypertension: Diagnosed 15 years ago  taking Lisinopril daily.  3. Hyperlipidemia: Patient is taking Atorvastatin daily since 10 years back.  4. Ischemic Heart Disease: The patient had a myocardial infarction 8 years ago.  5. Smoking: Heavy smoker for 40 years but quit 5 years ago after heart attack.  6. Chronic Kidney Disease: Moderate severity due to long-standing diabetes and hypertension.  7. Peripheral Arterial Disease: Diagnosed three years ago  managed through lifestyle modifications and antiplatelet therapy (low-dose aspirin).  Current Medication:   - Metformin  - Insulin - Lisinopril - Atorvastatin - Aspirin  Social and Lifestyle:   The patient is a widower and lives with his adult daughter. He leads a sedentary lifestyle and follows a diet high in carbohydrates and fats. Quit smoking 5 years ago but has a history of heavy smoking.   Assessment: Probable case of critical limb ischemia – the patient is presenting with the classic symptoms of rest pain and a non-healing wound. His medical history is significant for Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension  Hyperlipidemia  Ischemic Heart Disease  Peripheral Arterial Disease – all of which are risk factors for developing critical limb ischemia. His long history of smoking is also a significant contributor. In his case  the most probable underlying cause is poorly managed diabetes and its resultant microvascular complications.
7,6,32,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial32,Problem Representation:  A 68-year-old Caucasian male with a significant past medical history of tobacco use (smoked 1 pack/day for 40 years  quit 8 years ago)  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with severe  persistent pain in his right lower leg and foot for the past four weeks. His pain is worse at rest and especially disturbs his sleep. He also reports difficulty walking short distances due to this pain. On a recent physician examination  it was noted that his right foot was cool to touch with diminished pulse. His capillary refill was delayed and his foot was discolored  indicative of poor perfusion. Further investigation through Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) showed results below the normal range. His medical history also included mild peripheral neuropathy diagnosed a year ago  and a myocardial infarction 7 years ago for which he was treated with a drug-eluting stent and optimal medical therapy.  He currently takes aspirin  a beta-blocker  an ACE inhibitor  and a potent statin  supplemented by insulin and metformin. The patient has been on these medications for several years and has been generally adherent  however  glycosylated Hb levels have been erratically controlled  hovering around 8-9% on his last few clinic visits. He has been counseled multiple times about strict glycemic control  dietary measures  and regular exercise. Despite mitigating his tobacco use 8 years ago  he's been struggling to control his diabetes and maintain a steady exercise regimen due to his worsening limb symptoms and ischemia.  The combination of distressing rest pain  evident signs of impaired tissue perfusion  and significant risk factors suggest this patient is suffering from critical limb ischemia. The severity of symptoms and uncontrolled diabetes implies a poor prognosis and highlights the need for intervention.
7,6,33,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial33,Demographic Characterization: Patient's name: Mr. Davis Age: 68 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher Living condition: Lives with his wife in a suburban area Smoking status: Former smoker  quit 15 years ago Alcohol consumption: Moderate drinker Physical activity: Moderate  exercises once to twice a week  Past Medical History: The presentation of this patient includes a history of several medical conditions.  1. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Mr. Davis has been struggling with diabetes for the past 25 years. He is on a regimen of oral hypoglycemic medications and manages his diet accordingly. 2. Hypertension: He was diagnosed with hypertension 20 years ago. The condition is reasonably well-controlled through medication.  3. Chronic Kidney Disease: His kidney function has continuously deteriorated due to diabetes. He is in early stage 3 CKD. 4. Peripheral Arterial Disease: Mr. Davis was informed about this condition 5 years ago after suffering from claudication. 5. Hyperlipidemia: He has been diagnosed with high cholesterol  currently managed with statin treatment. 6. History of coronary artery disease: Mr. Davis suffered a mild heart attack 7 years ago from which he made a full recovery. He continues to take low-dose aspirin and a beta-blocker for heart protection.  Recent Complaints:  Mr. Davis came in for an evaluation due to consistent pain in his right lower leg that doesn't go away with rest and has been interfering with his sleep. He also noticed a non-healing wound on his right foot. Upon physical examination  his right lower limb was colder compared to the left  and pulses were absent in the right leg. A proposed diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was made based on his complaints and symptoms.
7,6,34,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial34,Patient Profile:  - **Name:** John Doe - **Gender:** Male - **Age:** 72 years old - **Occupation:** Retired teacher - **Marital Status:** Widowed - **Location:** Suburban setting in NY - **Ethnicity:** Caucasian  Health Insights:  - John has a long-standing history of smoking approximately 2 packs per day for around 30 years  but he quit 10 years ago. - He is overweight with a BMI of 28.5 kg/m2. - High blood pressure diagnosed 8 years ago  on medication (Lisinopril 20mg daily). - John was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 15 years ago. Now  his diabetes is poorly controlled with a recent HbA1c of 8%. - He also suffers from high cholesterol  which is controlled with statin therapy (simvastatin 40 mg daily). - History of a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) with full recovery about 5 years ago.  Presenting complaint:  - John now presents with severe pain in his right foot  especially at night and at rest. - He reports the foot feels cold and is paler in comparison to the other. - Ulcer has developed on the toe that is not healing and causing intense pain. - He has also complained of decreased mobility due to pain and this was affecting his quality of life.  Diagnosis & Problems:  - Main problem: Having these signs and symptoms  John is highly suspected to have Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). - CLI is a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores. Risk factors like smoking  diabetes  high blood pressure  high cholesterol levels  and being overweight come into play in John's case. If not treated in a timely manner  CLI can result in the need for limb amputation. - John's difficulty controlling his blood sugars is a significant risk factor for the development and progression of peripheral arterial disease. - In addition  poorly controlled diabetes can also lead to the development of peripheral neuropathy  contributing to the development of ulcers. - His history of TIA suggests the presence of systemic atherosclerosis  increasing the risk of CLI.  Plan:  - Immediate assessment and complete vascular study needs to be done to confirm the diagnosis. - John may need aggressive treatment including lifestyle modification  medications  or even surgery to alleviate his symptoms and save his limbs. - His diabetes and hypertension management also need to be reassessed.

The pain is typically relieved by dangling his foot off the bed. The patient has also noticed non-healing ulcers on his left foot. He has lost weight and his appetite is decreased.   The above symptoms could be indicative of a condition known as critical limb ischemia which refers to severe blockage in the arteries of the lower extremities  which markedly reduces blood-flow.
7,6,40,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial40,Patient Problem Representation:  Demographics:  - A 72-year-old Caucasian male.   Presenting Complaint:  - The patient reports persistent  severe pain in his right lower leg and foot at rest. The pain increases at night and improves partially when the leg is dangled over the side of the bed.   History of Present Illness:  - The patient states that the pain started two months back and has gradually worsened. He also discloses that he has experienced some weight loss due to decreased appetite  but cannot quantify it.  - He reports noticing a nonhealing wound on his right foot for a month now  which is causing him a distressing degree of pain.   Past Medical History:  - He has a significant history of coronary artery disease (CAD) for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) ten years ago.  - He has been managing type 2 diabetes mellitus with metformin for the past 18 years and reveals inconsistent glycemic control. - The patient is a current smoker for more than 50 years with unsuccessful quit attempts. He drinks alcohol occasionally.   Clinical Findings:  - On examination  the right foot appears pale  cold with diminished dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.  - The foot wound measures 2 cm with a yellowish base and surrounded by hyperpigmented skin.  Based on the history  physical examination  risk factors  and assuming normal blood tests and negative relevant imaging for other issues  the problem likely to be evaluated is critical limb ischemia (CLI). CLI is a severe obstruction of the arteries which drastically reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and even skin ulcers or sores.
7,6,41,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial41,Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male of medium build  presenting with symptoms of chronic limb ischemia.   Presenting Complaint: The patient reports an extended period of severe  unrelenting pain in his right lower limb. This pain is notably exacerbated when the limb is elevated and somewhat relieved when the limb is in a dependent position. The patient has experienced progressive difficulty in walking due to pain (claudication)  and he notes having rest pain in his foot. Visible atrophy of the muscles in the affected leg is noticed  and there are clear symptoms of chronic foot ulcers that are not healing.    Past Medical History: Upon reviewing the patient’s medical history  it was noted that he is a recidivist smoker for the past 45 years  with a pack-a-day habit. He also has a consistent history of uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 15 years ago  but it has not been well-controlled. He is not under regular follow-up for his diabetes  which has potentially contributing to the microvascular and macrovascular complications he is experiencing. No history of any thromboembolic events in the past.   Family History: The patient's father passed away from myocardial infarction at the age of 72.   Social History: He is a retired steelworker who currently lives alone at home.   Current Medications: Metformin  Insulin  Aspirin  Lisinopril and Atorvastatin.   Allergies:  No known drug allergies.   Review of Systems: Significant for uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia.   Physical Examination: Lower extremity examination reveals diminished pulses in the right foot  ABI of 0.4 on right side  dry gangrene of the right big toe  and some trophic skin changes on the leg. Pain upon elevation of leg  relieved by hanging leg off the edge of the bed. No evidences of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular diseases.   Impression: Given the patient’s age  lifestyle and presenting symptoms  differential diagnoses will be focused on Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to peripheral artery disease (PAD) due to long-standing uncontrolled diabetes and smoking habit. This is further complicated by the patient's hypertension  hyperlipidemia and smoking habits.

Review of Systems: Cardiovascular system shows a history of MI. Endocrine system reveals controlled diabetes mellitus Type II.  Given the patient's age  race  history of smoking  hypertension  Type II diabetes  past MI  and current symptoms  the patient may be suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia secondary to Peripheral Artery Disease. This case urges immediate attention and management to preserve the affected limb's functioning.
7,6,43,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial43,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old African-American male  smoker with a history of heavy alcohol consumption  presents with significant pain in his right lower extremity. Always had a sedentary lifestyle with poor dietary habits.  Presenting Complaint: The patient complains of constant  severe pain in his right leg which intensifies when the leg is at rest or during nighttime. The pain  which used to be intermittent  has intensified over the last few days. He has also noticed non-healing wounds on his right foot and significant weight loss over the past month. There is also growing difficulty in walking distances  suggesting claudication  and an overall feeling of weakness.  Past Medical History: The patient has a documented medical history that includes uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (for 15 years)  hypertension (for 10 years)  hypercholesterolemia  and peripheral artery disease. He also suffered a transient ischemic attack five years ago. For all conditions  he has been on pertinent medications but mentions poor medication compliance.   Family History: Immediate family has history of heart disease and diabetes.  Social History: Smoker for 40 years (1 pack/day) and heavy alcohol use for 20 years  but he quit drinking alcohol 5 years ago. He lives alone and has limited social interactions.  This representation aids in highlighting potential risk factors and comorbidities which may explain the onset of critical limb ischemia. The patient's age  race  diabetes  hypertension  peripheral artery disease  smoking  heavy alcohol use  and a sedentary lifestyle all contribute to his increased susceptibility. The non-healing wounds  claudication  and rest pain indicate severe disease progression  while poor medication compliance might explain ineffective condition management. Considering these aspects  the patient likely requires immediate intervention to prevent limb loss.
7,6,44,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial44,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 67-year-old African American male with a history of type 2 diabetes  peripheral artery disease (PAD)  hypertension  and chronic kidney disease  presents with progressively increasing pain in his right calf worsened by walking (claudication) and relieved with rest over the last four months. He smoked heavily in the past and recently quit a year ago. He reports a nonhealing ulcer on his right heel.  Past Medical History (PMH): 1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (on a metformin regimen) - Diagnosed 10 years ago. 2. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) - Diagnosed five years ago. 3. Chronic kidney disease (stage 3) - Diagnosed two months ago. 4. Hypertension - Diagnosed 15 years ago. 5. History of heavy smoking (40 pack-years)  quit last year.  Review of Systems (ROS): Positive for rest pain and nonhealing wounds on the extremities. He denies chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  nausea  vomiting  fever  and weight changes. His pain is 8/10 at rest  worsens with activity  non-radiating and is located in the calf muscle.  Socioeconomic status: Retired construction worker. Lives with his wife. Their only daughter lives out of state.  Representative Problem: The patient represents a typical case of suspected critical limb ischemia (CLI)  clinically manifested with rest pain  nonhealing wounds  and claudication. Given the concrete vascular risk factors present in his profile  including uncontrolled diabetes  PAD  hypertension  CKD  and smoking  a clinical suspicion of CLI becomes highly likely. Hyperlipidemia  a typical risk factor for CLI  is notably absent from this patient's profile  which might warrant consideration in the problem list. The nonhealing ulcer on his leg further raises the suspicion of CLI.  Next Steps: CLI is a severe manifestation of PAD and requires emergent attention due to the risk of limb loss. The next steps should include further diagnostic evaluation beginning with Ankle-Brachial index (ABI) followed by angiography (CTA / MRA or traditional) for definitive diagnosis. Referral for vascular surgical consultation is crucial given the severity of symptoms and presence of nonhealing ulcers. Concurrent wound care management for the heel ulcer and optimization of his risk factors should also be part of his continuing care.

His illnesses are managed with interventions that include oral hypoglycemic agents and antihypertensive medications. His recent cessation of smoking may be exacerbating his peripheral arterial disease and inducing critical limb ischemia. Further investigations and management are necessary.
7,6,54,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial54,Patient Profile:  Name: J.D. Stewart Age: 66 years old Sex: Male Race/ Ethnicity: African-American Occupation: Retired military officer Residence: Urban setting  Presenting Problem: The patient presented with severe pain in his right lower leg  even during rest. Also complains about non-healing ulcers on his right foot. He states that he feels extreme cold in the lower sections of the leg  especially at night and often wakes up due to the pain.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 10 years complicated by peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy. His blood sugar levels have been relatively uncontrolled despite being on an intensive insulin regimen. He has also been treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past 6 years. He was a heavy smoker but quit 5 years ago.  Family History: His father died of a heart attack at 72 and his mother had a stroke at the age of 75. Both parents had diabetes. He has one older brother who also has diabetes and is currently on dialysis.  Social History: The patient lives with his wife. He is a war veteran and retired from the military 10 years ago. He has quit smoking but had a history of smoking two packs a day for about 30 years. He drinks alcohol socially  regretfully admitting to heavy drinking in his younger years.  Allergies: The patient has no known drug allergies.  Medications: The patient is currently on metformin  Lisinopril  Simvastatin  and insulin glargine.   The signs and symptoms suggest that the patient is suffering from critical limb ischemia  likely secondary to his uncontrolled diabetes and history of smoking. Further evaluation and management are necessary for his case. Him being a high-risk patient due to his past medical and family history  lifestyle  and demographic characterization. Critical limb ischemia in this patient might be indicative of more extensive peripheral artery disease  requiring further diagnostic evaluation and treatment.
7,6,55,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial55,Patient Demographic Information:  - Gender: Male - Age: 70 years - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired  previously worked in the construction sector - Lifestyle: Smoker  quit five years ago  Presenting Problem:   The patient has been experiencing severe pain in his right lower leg. The pain has persisted  even when he is at rest or when trying to sleep. He has also observed a noticeable decrease in the leg temperature  demonstrating a color change to pallor or even a bluish tint (cyanosis). He has difficulty walking due to the pain  which he describes as a burning or cramping sensation in calves and thighs.  Past Medical History:  - Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes 20 years ago. His condition is difficult to control  evidenced by HbA1c levels consistently above 7.0%. - Hypertension  diagnosed 15 years ago. Controlled with medication  but the patient admits to missing doses sometimes. - Previous amputation of the left great toe due to gangrene  approximately 2 years ago. This was also linked to poor circulation resulting from his diabetes. - History of coronary artery disease with stent placement 5 years ago. - Quit smoking five years ago  after having been a smoker for 45 years. - Obesity  with a BMI of 30. Attempts at weight loss have been unsuccessful. - Regular alcohol consumption up until 10 years ago.  Family History:  - Paternal Grandfather: Died from a heart attack  age 55. - Father: Diagnosed with peripheral artery disease. Underwent leg amputation due to uncontrolled gangrene  age 62. - Mother: Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes  well-controlled.  This patient’s lifestyle  including previous smoking and alcohol habits  combined with his predisposing conditions such as diabetes  hypertension  obesity  and known atherosclerosis (coronary artery disease)  all contribute to his risk for developing critical limb ischemia. His familial history of peripheral artery disease and amputation further heightens this risk.  The patient’s symptoms of rest pain and color changes in the affected limb are concerning for critical limb ischemia and necessitate prompt evaluation for possible intervention.
7,6,56,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial56,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 65 Sex: Male Race: White Occupation: Retired engineer Insurance: Medicare Residential Status: Living with spouse Presenting Complaint: Pain in the left leg  increasing in severity over the past couple weeks  especially after any physical exertion or even rest. The lower leg and toes often show discoloration  turning pale  blue or darkish.  Demographics:  John is a Caucasian male  retired engineer who is currently 65 years old. His wife reports that he has been a smoker for the past 30 years and normally consumes alcohol moderately. He suffers from occasional insomnia and has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with both his father and older brother passing away from heart related issues. John does not engage in regular physical activities and personally proclaims a moderate-to-low level active lifestyle  mainly involving general house chores and daily brief walks.   Past Medical History:   John has a history of Type 2 diabetes  which has been managed with oral hypoglycemics for the last ten years. He was diagnosed with high blood pressure and has been on medication for the past five years. The patient suffered a mild myocardial infarction 3 years ago  from which he recovered with no complications. He has high cholesterol levels since the last two years  which have been managed with statins  and he also developed peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  established by an Ankle-Brachial Index test two years ago. The patient underwent angioplasty in the right leg last year due to a blocked artery causing serious leg pain.  Personal Habits:  John smokes about a pack of cigarettes a day and has done so for the past 30 years. He also consumes alcohol - about two drinks on most days. His dietary habits are not ideal  typically consisting of high fat  high salt foods.  Clinical Examination:  On general physical examination  John's lower left limb showed signs of atrophic skin changes and cold temperature. Pedal pulses were not palpable in the left foot. A sore  approximately 2 cm in diameter  is visible on his left foot which is slow to heal and mark of his necrotic patch was observed over lateral aspect of his left foot. The left leg and foot shows symptoms of decreased blood flow. There were no signs of infection.   Diagnosis:  Based on these findings  John is suspected to have critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe blockage in the arteries of the lower extremities  which markedly reduces blood-flow.
7,6,57,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial57,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  A 72-year-old  African American man with a known history of smoking two packs a day for over 30 years is brought by his daughter.   Presenting Complaint:  The patient complains of severe  persistent pain in his right foot even while at rest. He reports skin color changes  non-healing wounds  and intermittent claudication. Symptoms seem to worsen during the night.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a significant medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus that has been poorly controlled for over 10 years  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral arterial disease (PAD).   Psycho-social History:  The patient lives with his daughter who serves as the primary caregiver. He has a sedentary lifestyle and a high cholesterol diet. He has been a chronic alcoholic and chain smoker.   Family History:  Likewise  there is a marked family history of coronary artery disease and stroke  with one of his brothers having suffered a heart attack at the age of 56 while his mother had a stroke at age 79.  Medication History:  He is currently on aspirin  a statin  ramipril  gliclazide  and metformin. He has allergies to lisinopril causing angioedema.  This demographic  medical  and lifestyle background suggest that the severe rest pain and skin changes in the right foot can potentially be attributed to critical limb ischemia consequent to atherosclerosis and uncontrolled diabetes. The high cardiovascular risk factors present could also indicate multi-vessel disease. Considering the patient's age  lifestyle  chronic diseases  and poor medication management  early intervention is crucial to prevent limb loss and allied complications.
7,6,58,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial58,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 76-year-old male of African-American descent  retired construction worker.  Demographics: The patient is a long-time smoker with a 35 pack-year history; he gave up smoking two years ago. He lives alone and has a family history of cardiovascular diseases. His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 64  and his elder brother is living with diabetes and peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Presenting Symptoms: The patient complains of severe pain in his right lower limb  which sometimes extends to his hip. The pain is particularly intense when walking and sometimes disturbs his sleep. He reported that he has noticed his right foot appearing bluish  there are ulcers around his toenails  and he often feels cold on that foot as compared to the other foot.   Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 10 years ago and has been on medication. He has been regularly assessed for his blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 7 years back  he was diagnosed with diabetes and has been managing it with medication  diet  and exercise. However  his glucose control has been suboptimal. He has no known allergies.  Review of Systems: The patient denies symptoms of chest pain  palpitations  or shortness of breath. No recent history of fever  weight loss  loss of appetite  or fatigue. The patient also denies any abdominal or back pain.   Physical Examination: Examination of the right foot reveals a lack of pulsation in the foot's dorsal and post-tibial arteries. There is coldness to the touch  with pallor on elevation and dependent rubor  and with noticeable loss of hair on the leg. There are two non-healing ulcers on the big and second toes  with mild discharge but no signs of cellulitis or deep tissue infection. The left foot appears normal.  Investigations: Initial investigations include the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  blood tests for kidney function  and HbA1c levels. Further diagnostics would be guided based on the results of these investigations. Possible follow-up exams could include duplex ultrasound  CT angiography  or angiogram.  Impression: The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a picture consistent with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  possibly due to advanced Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). His age  smoking history  and pre-existing conditions (hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes) increase risk. The patient requires urgent vascular evaluation and management to prevent limb loss and mitigating other potential complications. Differentiating whether the CLI is due to embolic or thrombotic causes might help dictate his medical or surgical management.

7,6,77,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial77,Patient Profile:  Name: John Q. Public Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting Issue: The patient presents with symptomatic critical limb ischemia in his right leg which is characterized by pain in the limb  even during rest  with known evidence of progressive worsening over the last three months. Also  the patient reported having had intermittent claudication for the past 3 years.   Medical History: The patient has a significant past medical history including hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 15 years ago. For these conditions  the patient has been on consistent and regular medication.  He has a smoking history of 30 years but quit smoking about 5 years ago. There has been no known alcohol or substance abuse. A history of peripheral arterial disease diagnosed 5 years ago is noted. He underwent percutaneous angioplasty for his left leg 2 years ago.  No known allergies to medications have been reported. The patient's family history includes a father who died from a heart attack at 70 and a mother with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.  Current Medications: The patient is taking Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Aspirin as a blood thinner.  Physical Examination: On physical exam  there was noted abnormal pulse on his right lower limb. Significant hair loss on the affected limb is noted. The skin of the lower right leg shows trophic changes (pale  thin  shiny skin)  with mild to moderate edema  and an ulcer on the outer side of the right ankle.  Lab Results: The patient's blood lipid profile and blood glucose levels are irregular. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is 0.4  indicating severe blockage and increasing risk of limb-threatening ischemia.  Imaging Findings: Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremity reveals significant stenosis in the right femoral artery. Additional imaging via CT angiography is suggested for more detailed visualization of the disease extent.   Working Diagnosis: The patient is diagnosed with critical limb ischemia of the right lower extremity  potentially secondary to peripheral arterial disease  hypertension  and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.  Plan: The recommended plan is to control the risk factors by optimizing medical therapy. Diabetes and hypertension should be controlled. An urgent vascular surgery consultation is warranted. Depending on the assessment of the vascular surgeon  a vascular intervention like angioplasty or surgical bypass can be considered.
7,6,78,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial78,"Patient Problem Representation:  Demographics: Mr. White  a 72-year-old African American retired construction worker  lives with his wife in their suburban home. He is a lifetime non-smoker but has a history of heavy alcohol intake.  Presenting Problem: The patient presents with a one-month history of progressive dull  cramping  and severe pain in his right lower limb  which is aggravated with activity (exertional pain) and at rest  primarily at night. He also complains of non-healing ulcers on his right foot that have been present for two weeks.  Past Medical History: 1. Cardiovascular system - He has a ten-year history of uncontrolled hypertension and five-year history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (poor metabolic control). 2. Respiratory system - He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to occupational asbestos exposure. 3. Musculoskeletal system - He suffers from arthritis but is unable to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to an established diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease. 4. Other - The patient underwent treatment for alcoholic cirrhosis three years ago. He has tried multiple times to abstain from alcohol but has frequently relapsed.  Family History: The patient has a family history of peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular diseases. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 62.  Review Of Systems: The patient reports no fever  no chest pain or palpitation  no dyspnea  and no abdominal pain. He has noticed a slight intolerance to cold conditions and has lost about 5 pounds over one month due to decreased appetite.  Medication History: He takes amlodipine for his hypertension  metformin  and glimepiride for his diabetes. He also uses an inhaler (budesonide and formoterol) for his COPD.  Psychosocial History: He has been retired for 7 years and mostly stays at home due to his restrictive physical condition. He has infrequent social interactions and identified himself as a """"loner"""". He has a past history of depression and was treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  which he stopped taking a year ago due to financial constraints.  Relevant Clinico-pathological correlation: The presentation of pain on exertion and at rest  non-healing ulcers  and sensation of cold in the limb is suggestive of critical limb ischemia  a severe manifestation of peripheral artery disease. This condition is primarily due to a significant reduction of blood flow in the peripheral arteries  often due to atherosclerosis. The patient's underlying uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension greatly contribute to the risk of atherosclerosis. The weight loss may be attributable to potential underlying malnutrition and poor appetite due to pain and depression."

7,6,81,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial81,Problem Representation:   A 68-year-old African-American male patient presents with a complaint of severe  unrelenting pain in his right leg at rest accompanied by the presence of non-healing ulcers on his right foot. The pain often intensifies during the night and temporary partial relief is achieved by hanging his leg off the side of the bed. Physical examination reveals cooling of the skin in his right foot  absence of pulse in the right foot dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries  and the presence of dark necrotic tissue in the foot’s lateral aspect.  Demographic Characteristics: - Age: 68 years old - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: African-American - Occupation: Retired construction worker  Social History: - Lives alone  has regular visits from his adult children - Smoker (1 pack per day for the last 40 years) - No record of alcohol or illicit drug use  Past Medical History: - History of controlled type-2 diabetes for the past 12 years - Hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago - Diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 5 years ago - Underwent an endarterectomy for left-sided PAD 3 years ago - History of dyslipidemia  Current Medication:  - Metformin for diabetes - Lisinopril for hypertension - Statin for dyslipidemia  Family History: - Father died of myocardial infarction  - Mother had a stroke  The patient's symptoms of severe pain at rest and the presence of non-healing ulcers and necrotic tissue indicate critical limb ischemia  which is a result of severely obstructed arteries and drastically reduced blood flow. The patient's long history of smoking  along with his hypertensive  diabetic  and dyslipidemic status dramatically increases his risk for this condition and might have contributed to the rapid progression of PAD observed in this patient. Immediate attention is required to prevent amputation of the affected limb.
7,6,82,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial82,Problem Representation:  Patient Description: Mr. Jones is a 68-year-old African-American male presenting with excruciating pain in his left foot that started two weeks ago while at rest  causing him many sleepless nights. The pain intensity escalates when his leg is elevated and alleviates somewhat when he drops his leg down. He also complains of non-healing wounds on his toes. He has a long-standing history of uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus (diagnosed for 18 years) and hypertension (diagnosed for 16 years) that require medication. He has been a heavy smoker for the past 35 years and has been consuming alcohol moderately for about 30 years. He hasn't been physically active due to work commitments in the past. He has a family history of peripheral artery disease. For the last couple of years  he has been experiencing progressive fatigue and muscle pain in his left leg while walking that improved with rest (claudication).  Critical information: Diabetes  hypertension  heavy smoker  alcohol consumption  physical inactivity  family history of PAD  symptoms of claudication  Problem Representation: The patient presents with critical limb ischemia  characterized by severe rest pain  non-healing wounds  and history of claudication - a disease manifestation of severe peripheral arterial disease. His diabetes  hypertension  smoking history  and alcohol consumption are significant risk factors for PAD. With concomitant risk factors  his disease is likely to progress further if he doesn't adhere to treatment. His sedentary lifestyle also increases his risk level. The positive family history of PAD raises concerns about a possible genetic predisposition.

Social history: Mr. Doe is a widower with two adult children. He lives alone in an urban area. He is a retired banker. He has been a smoker for about 40 years and indulges in mild alcohol consumption.   Family history: Father died from a heart attack and mother had a stroke. His younger brother is also diabetic and hypertensive.  Review of systems: No fever  no recent weight loss  no chest pain or shortness of breath. He complains of a decrease in appetite.   This patient profile and history suggest Mr. Doe could be suffering from critical limb ischemia  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities and has progressed to the point of severe pain and even skin ulcers or sores.
7,6,85,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial85,Problem Representation:   Patient Profile:  - Age: 76-year-old  - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: African-American  - Occupation: Retired   Presenting Problem:  The patient presents to the clinic with rest pain in his left lower extremity that has been progressively worsening over the past few weeks. The pain increases when the leg is elevated and lessens when the leg is dangled. The patient also reports intermittent claudication while walking short distances. Upon further inspection  the skin on the patient's left foot appears pale and there are signs of non-healing ulcers on his toes.   Relevant Past Medical History:  1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 20 years  poorly controlled 2. Hypertension for the past 15 years  controlled with medication 3. 10 pack-years smoking history  quit 5 years ago 4. History of lower limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 5. 20-year history of hyperlipidemia  Family History: 1. Father died from myocardial infarction at age 69 2. Maternal uncle with a history of stroke  Other Pertinent Information: 1. The patient lives alone and is independent in activities of daily living (ADLs) 2. He follows a diet that is high in carbohydrates and fats 3. He is socially active and enjoys playing chess at the local community center 4. He admits to not managing his diabetes adequately due to the complexity of his medication regimen and difficulty affording medication 5. He denies alcohol use  but admits to a 15-year history of cigarette smoking  although he quit smoking 5 years ago.   Reasons for current presentation:  This patient with a history of PAD  poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes  and hypertension presents with critical limb ischemia characterized by progressive rest pain  intermittent claudication  and non-healing wounds in his left lower extremity. Urgent diagnosis and appropriate treatment are needed to prevent further complications such as tissue loss and possible limb amputation.   Short-term Problem list: 1. Poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes 2. Hypertension 3. Critical limb ischemia 4. Unhealthy diet 5. Non-healing ulcers  Long-term Problem list: 1. High risk for cardiovascular disease 2. Risk for limb loss secondary to critical limb ischemia 3. Need for lifestyle modification including dietary change 4. Proper management of Type 2 diabetes 5. Maintaining cessation of smoking.
7,6,86,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial86,Problem Representation: A 70-year-old African American male  a long-term smoker with a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and hypertension is presenting with symptoms consistent with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The patient is also known to experience dyslipidemia and obesity. He has a history of Transient Ischemic Attacks related to peripheral artery disease.   Given he is a chronic smoker and his past medical history  he is at high risk of CLI. His symptoms have progressed over the past few weeks  they include resting leg pain  non-healing wounds on his left lower extremity  and reduced mobility due to pain. This patient’s worsening symptoms suggest severe blood flow reduction  endangering his lower extremities. His extensive medical past indicates multiple risk factors for the advanced stage of peripheral arterial disease  making CLI a likely diagnosis.   The primary concern is the risk of amputation if circulation to the affected limb does not improve  which may result in an immediate threat to his limb's viability. Additionally  CLI is a signal for advanced systemic atherosclerosis  hence there’s also an increased risk for heart attack and stroke. Due to his age and existing comorbid conditions  the patient may require an aggressive multidisciplinary treatment approach  and lifestyle modifications to manage and mitigate further complications.   Further diagnostic procedures and management plan should be directed by an appropriate specialist  such as a vascular surgeon  to confirm the severity of the disease and guide subsequent treatment options. The approach should focus on relieving symptoms  improving his quality of life  preventing limb loss  and addressing cardiovascular risk factors. 
7,6,87,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial87,Demographic and Medical History Representation:  Patient Profile:  65-year-old African American male.  Household Conditions:  Living with wife  in an urban dwelling; non-smoker; retired military officer.   Social Economic Status:  Belongs to the middle income bracket.   Lifestyle:  Moderate physical activity  primarily walking.  Chief Complaint:  Has been experiencing extreme pain in his right lower leg and foot  even during periods of rest. Reports that his foot often feels cold and occasionally turns a bluish color.  Medical History:   1. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Diagnosed 5 years ago. Poorly managed due to lack of regular follow up.     2. Hypertension: Diagnosed 7 years ago and on medication (Losartan 50mg  once daily).   3. Hyperlipidemia: Diagnosed 6 years ago and on medication (Simvastatin 20mg  once at night).  4. Coronary Artery Disease: Had a myocardial infarction 3 years ago and underwent angioplasty.  5. Obesity: BMI is 30.2. Advised for dietary lifestyle changes.  6. History of stroke: Had a non-disabling stroke 3 years ago.  7. Family History: Father died of myocardial infarction at 72. Elder sister has hypertension and diabetes.  8. Allergies: None.  Recent Evaluations:  The patient's blood glucose levels are uncontrolled  with the latest HbA1c result being 9.5% (should be < 7% for diabetic patients). LDL cholesterol (180 mg/dL) and blood pressure readings (160/90 mmHg) are also significantly above the target range (< 100 mg/dL and 130/80 mmHg  respectively).  Summary:   This 65-year-old patient presents severe peripheral artery disease manifesting as critical limb ischemia in his right leg  a complication of his poorly controlled diabetes and other comorbidities. His past history of coronary artery disease and stroke elevates his risk levels for future cardiovascular events  and his poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia further compromise his cardiovascular health. The uncontrolled nature of his multiple chronic conditions indicates a possible need for stricter management of his ongoing care regimen.
7,6,88,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial88,Problem representation:  A 68-year-old African-American male with a known history of type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension presents with severe  unrelenting pain in his left leg  described as a continuous  heavy sensation that significantly increases when he is not in an upright position. He describes the pain as 9 out of 10 in severity scale. It started roughly three days ago  associated with a non-healing ulcer on the same leg. His leg is noticeably paler compared to the contralateral limb. The patient also admits to occasional sensation of numbness and cold in the affected limb. He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking and has minimal alcohol consumption.   In his medical history  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease 2 years ago but was not compliant with prescribed medication. He had a myocardial infarction five years ago  which required coronary artery bypass graft. Furthermore  he was diagnosed with renal insufficiency constant to his diabetes three years ago  requiring hemodialysis. He is currently taking insulin  metformin  aspirin  and a statin. Despite aggressive management of his diabetes  his last HgA1c was 8.4  indicating poor glucose control.   His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease with his father dying of a stroke at the age of 62 and his mother diagnosed with congestive heart failure. His brother and sister both have type II diabetes.  This patient's clinical picture and medical history are suggestive of Critical Limb Ischemia in the setting of advanced peripheral arterial disease  likely exacerbated by his non-compliance to medications  poorly-controlled diabetes  smoking habits  and his history of renal insufficiency requiring hemodialysis.
7,6,89,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial89,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. John Grey  who currently presents with critical limb ischemia in the right lower limb. He is a retired mechanic and a current smoker with a 40 pack-year smoking history. He is a known hypertensive for 10 years and also has a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient lives alone  is independent with all of his activities of daily living  and does not have any known drug allergies.   Presenting Problem: The patient reports a two-month history of progressively worsening pain in his right calf  particularly while walking (""""claudication"""") and  now  at rest. This is associated with decreased temperature and pallor of the right foot  and mild foot drop. He also reports ulcers on his toes that are not healing despite regular dressing and antibiotic therapy for the past 2 weeks.   Past Medical History: Mr. Grey was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago  which is currently controlled with Losartan. He was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 5 years ago and is being managed with Metformin. There is no known history of coronary artery disease or stroke  although he has not undergone any specific cardiac evaluation. His sister died of myocardial infarction at the age of 67. There is no other relevant surgical or family history.   Clinical Encounter: Upon examination  there is pallor and decreased sensory and motor function in the right foot. The right femoral pulse is feeble  and the popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial pulses are absent. There is a non-healing ulcer present on the great toe. Blood investigations show a HbA1c level of 7.2.  This case represents a typical presentation of a patient with critical limb ischemia with background risk factors of smoking  hypertension  and diabetes."
7,6,90,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial90,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  - Gender: Male - Age: 68 Years Old - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired Factory Worker - Marital Status: Married - Body Mass Index: 32 (Overweight) - Smoking Status: Former smoker  quit ten years ago but smoked a pack a day for 30 years  Past Medical History:  - Previous lower extremity revascularization six months ago. - Type II diabetes mellitus diagnosed 15 years ago  moderately controlled with metformin. - Hypertension for ten years  controlled with lisinopril. - Dyslipidemia managed with atorvastatin. - History of coronary artery disease; underwent coronary artery bypass grafting five years ago.   Presenting Problem:  - The patient reports rest pain in his right leg worsening over the past two weeks. - The pain increases with walking and improves with rest; however  in the past three days  pain has become persistent  even at rest.  - He also reports that his toes on the same leg have become progressively black over the past week.  - Further examination reveals absent popliteal  dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses on the right side. The left leg pulses are weak but palpable.  - There's notable temperature difference between both legs- the right leg feels cold to touch compared to the left one.  - An ulcer is present on the dorsum of the right foot with darkened toes suggestive of gangrene.  This demographic and clinical presentation suggests a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  most likely due to peripheral arterial disease worsened by his history of diabetes and smoking.
7,6,91,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial91,Problem Representation:  A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents with complaints of excruciating pain in his right lower leg  especially during movements  nocturnal leg cramps  and wounds on his foot that does not seem to heal. The patient belongs to a low socio-economic status and resides in a semi-rural area.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus which was diagnosed 10 years ago  and he's on oral hypoglycemics. He has been a smoker for thirty years and consumes alcohol socially. The patient also has a history of hypertension  managed with ACE inhibitors. There is also a record of dyslipidemia  treated with statins. His father died of myocardial infarction at an early age  suggesting a possible history of familial cardiovascular diseases.  These factors suggest a high risk for peripheral arterial diseases and put the patient in a category of probable critical limb ischemia. This collection of symptoms and medical background shows a critical condition of reduced blood flow to the limbs  which can lead to pain  wounds  and in severe cases  the requirement of limb amputation. There seems a need for prompt diagnosis and aggressive management strategy to prevent further progression of the disease and improve quality of life.                                           
7,6,92,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial92,Problem Representation: A 67-year-old  Caucasian male of average weight and height  non-smoker  and diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes is presenting symptoms of critical limb ischemia. The patient has a 10-year history of uncontrolled diabetes  dyslipidemia  hypertension  and atherosclerosis. He also had peripheral artery disease and underwent a below-knee amputation 2 years ago. There have been consecutive episodes of intermittent claudication mostly affecting the right leg  which is not completely relieved by rest. The patient is compliant with antihypertensive and glucose-lowering drugs but has severe pain at rest  non-healing ulcers  and gangrene in the right leg. Current medication includes metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin. The patient's mother had a history of peripheral artery disease which leads to a familial predisposition. The patient lives a sedentary lifestyle  consumes a diet high in saturated fat. He denies alcohol or substance abuse but has been under chronic stress due to the deterioration of his health condition. Up to date  his immunizations are complete. Routine lab test results indicate high fasting blood sugar levels  high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels  and high blood pressure.
7,6,93,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial93,Problem Representation:  Patient Information:  A 67-year-old Caucasian male with a body mass index (BMI) of 29.5 kg/m^2  currently a smoker with a history of 40 pack-years.  Presenting Complaint: The patient claims persistent and severe rest pain in his right foot for the last month  characterized by a crampy and dull sensation. He describes consistent numbness and coldness in the same limb  worsening during the night while resting and slightly resolved when hanging the foot over the bed.  Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension for the last 10 years under medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily)  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (managed with metformin 500mg twice daily)  and hyperlipidemia (controlled with atorvastatin 20mg daily). The patient had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago  treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)  and has been on Aspirin 75mg and Clopidogrel 75mg since then.   Social History:  Retired insurance agent  lives with his wife in an urban town. He admits to smoking (1 pack/day for 40 years) and occasional alcohol use.  Family History:  Father had stroke at 67  mother had breast cancer diagnosed at 61  one brother with coronary artery disease  one sister with no significant diseases.  Physical Exam: Pale  cool  and pulseless right foot with blackish discoloration in the toes (indicative of tissue necrosis). Auscultation of the heart and lungs are normal  and the abdomen is soft and non-tender.   Diagnostic evaluation:  The ankle-brachial index (ABI) demonstrates values of 0.3 on the right side and 0.9 on the left side. ABI < 0.4 is indicative of severe peripheral artery disease.   Plan: Considering the critical limb ischemia diagnosis  urgent peripheral angiography and possible revascularization procedure are planned. The need for escalation of antiplatelet therapy and smoking cessation are emphasized. Antidiabetic therapy might require optimization for better sugar control. Diet  exercise  and other lifestyle modifications will be discussed with the patient and his family to combat obesity and promote health.
7,6,94,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial94,Patient Profile Summary:  Demographics: Patient's Name: [John Doe] Age: 68 years old Gender: Male Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Accountant Living Situation: Lives alone in a two-story home Insurance: Medicare  Presenting Problem: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). These symptoms consist of painful cramping in the lower extremities after certain activities like walking for a prolonged period  rest pain typically in the feet  non-healing foot ulcers  and noticeable coldness in the lower leg.  Relevant Past Medical History: 1. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient has a history of Hypertension (high blood pressure) and Hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol). Both conditions were well-managed on medication. 2. Diabetes: The patient was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus 12 years ago and is on medication (Metformin). His glucose control has been suboptimal with recent HbA1C recorded at 7.8%. 3. Peripheral Vascular Disease: Diagnosed 5 years ago. Managed conservatively due to the mild nature of his symptoms at diagnosis. 4. Smoker: The patient has a 40 pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. 5. Routine blood works: Last check showed reduced kidney function and slight anemia.  Family History: Father deceased at 76 from Myocardial Infarction (heart attack). Mother deceased at 82 from Stroke and had a history of diabetes and hypertension. One brother  alive and well  living with diabetes and hypertension.  Psychosocial History: Non-drinker  quit smoking 10 years ago due to health reasons. The patient lives alone but has a supportive network of friends and family living nearby.  Prescriptions: - Aspirin 81 mg daily - Lisinopril 10 mg daily - Amlodipine 5mg daily - Metformin: 500 mg twice daily - Atorvastatin: 20 mg daily   Assessment: Given the patient's advanced age  history of Diabetes  Hypertension  high cholesterol  smoking  and Peripheral Vascular Disease  it seems he is at a higher risk for Critical Limb Ischemia.   He confirms symptoms of lower extremity pain with exertion  rest pain  and existing foot ulcers. The rest pain and wounds suggest severe arterial insufficiency and are indicative of Critical Limb Ischemia under the Rutherford classification. This will require further diagnostic examination and aggressive treatment to manage symptoms  prevent the progression of disease  and avoid possible amputation.

7,6,96,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial96,Problem Representation:   Patient Description:  A 72-year-old African-American male patient presents with recurrent  severe pain in his right foot that persists at rest and often disturbs his sleep. The pain is located in the lateral aspect of the right foot and is associated with non-healing ulcers in the toe. He mentions experiencing increasing difficulty in walking and can only walk short distances before being forced to stop due to pain.   Medical History:  The patient has a significant past medical history of: 1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed 10 years ago) 2. Hyperlipidemia  3. Hypertension  4. Coronary Artery Disease (has undergone Percutaneous Coronary Intervention 5 years ago) 5. History of tobacco use (quit 2 years ago after 40 years of heavy smoking)  Family History:  1. Father and older brother both diagnosed with Peripheral Arterial Disease and have undergone interventions  Social History:  1. Retired construction worker  married  and lives with his spouse.  2. No alcohol or illicit drug use.  This patient's demographic and clinical presentation and medical history strongly suggest critical limb ischemia.
7,6,97,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial97,Problem Representation:   Patient Profile:  A 68-year-old African-American male is presenting with symptoms associated with critical limb ischemia. His body mass index is 29.6  just within the obesity range. He is a smoker with a history of 20-pack years and admits to drinking socially. His diet consists of high-fat foods  and he has a minimal routine of physical activity. He lives in a rural area and has a history of delay in health care due to limited accessibility to medical services and knows the importance of seeking immediate medical care but often ignores it.  Medical History:  He has a past medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with suboptimal glycemic control  indicating poor compliance with his diabetic medication regimen. His latest HbA1c level was 9.0%  which is well above his target range. The patient also has a history of uncontrolled hypertension (recent readings consistently >140/90mmHg) and hypercholesterolemia.   One year ago  he experienced a myocardial infarction  had two coronary artery stents placed  and was placed on Aspirin and Atorvastatin afterward. He was also diagnosed with peripheral artery disease  which was managed conservatively. His medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  Aspirin  and Atorvastatin. However  compliance is sporadic due to forgetfulness and financial constraints.   Presenting Complaint:  The patient presents with increasing pain in his left lower limb at rest  which is severe enough to disturb his sleep. The patient also complains of non-healing ulcers on the same limb. On examination  the limb is pale and cool to touch with weakened distal pulses. On Doppler examination  there is significant reduction in ankle brachial pressure index  suggestive of severe peripheral arterial disease.   Family history:  His father had a history of coronary artery disease and his mother had a stroke  both suggesting inherited predisposition to cardiovascular diseases.  Social History:  The patient is retired  lives with his wife and is financially dependent on his state pension and insurance cover  which sometimes causes a delay in his ability to pay for his medications. He does not engage in regular physical activity and has limited access to nutritious food options in his rural settings.   Alerts:  The patient's current clinical presentation  combined with his past medical history  suggests that he may require surgical intervention for his ischemic lower limb  possibly up to the level of amputation if his condition does not improve with conservative management. Early referral to vascular services is paramount to prevent worsening of his condition.
7,6,98,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial98,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: James Smith  a 65-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department with severe pain in his left lower extremity. He is a known smoker with a 40-pack year history and works in a construction company. A resident of New York City but originally hailing from Alabama  he lives with his wife and reports a family history of heart disease.  Key Symptoms: Patient reports of persistent resting pain for the past 2 weeks being predominantly in the foot  specifically heel and forefoot that increases in severity upon elevation. He explained the pain is unlike anything he has experienced before  rating it 9 on a scale of 1-10. He also noticed ulcerations on his big toe that have not improved with over-the-counter remedies  and slower healing bruise on his leg. He has described having claudication symptoms for the past few months but has not sought any treatment.  Past Medical History: The patient has hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus that are well-controlled on medication. He also has dyslipidemia as a comorbidity. He was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease 1 year ago. No history of previous surgeries.   Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  his left lower extremity is noticeably cooler than the other and the skin is paler and shiny. An ulcer is visible on the great toe and has a pulse rate that is weaker in comparison to the right lower extremity.  Investigations: The ankle-brachial index (ABI) recorded was 0.3. Duplex ultrasound showed severe stenosis in the left superficial femoral artery. Complete blood count  renal function  and serum lipid profile are under process.   Clinical Impression: Considering the above information  the patient has presented with symptoms concerning for Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  with the most probable cause being his pre-existing peripheral artery disease  exacerbated by his lifestyle and other comorbidities. Immediate and appropriate treatment needs to be planned to alleviate the pain and to save the limb  which at this moment is at high risk for amputation.

Family history of Heart disease: Father died of a heart attack at an early age 8. Coronary artery disease: Has history of myocardial infarction 7 years ago  managed with coronary artery bypass grafting   Clinical Presentations and Relevant Details:   Presently  the patient complains of severe pain over his right lower limb which has been gradually worsening over the past few weeks. The pain intensifies after walking for a short distance making him stop and rest. Additionally  he reports that he frequently experiences numbness  tingling and his foot often feels cold. Also  he notices a non-healing ulcer on the right big toe. He has lost appetite and has unintentionally lost approximately 15 pounds in the past 3 months.   This clinical presentation suggests the possibility of critical limb ischemia  a severe stage of peripheral arterial disease where there is significant blockage in the arteries of the lower extremities causing severe pain  even at rest  and non-healing ulcer or gangrenes. This warrants urgent evaluation and possible intervention to restore blood supply and prevent limb loss. Further investigation would be necessary to confirm diagnosis.
7,6,100,diagnosis7-prompt6-trial100,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information:  Patient: Mr. Johnson  a 70-year-old White male  Past medical history:  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (poorly controlled) - Current smoker (40-pack-year smoking history) - Hypertension (on medication) - History of peripheral artery disease - Previous cardiac bypass surgery  - Dyslipidemia - A family history of heart disease   Presenting symptoms: - Recurrent and uncontrolled rest pain in the right lower limb noticeable for the past three weeks  especially distally (below the knee region) - Pain even while resting and worsens during the night - Non-healing wound on the right foot and noticeable skin discoloration - Reduced mobility  affecting quality of life  Physical examination: - Absent peripheral pulses in right lower limb - Pale and cold right foot with noticeable muscle atrophy - Presence of necrotic tissue around plantar ulcers - Signs of impaired sensory and motor function  Given the patient's clinical history  demographic factors  and physical findings  all signs point towards Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  which is the advanced stage of peripheral artery disease.  Supporting lab/Imaging findings (hypothetical): - Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI): <0.4 in right leg  indicating severe disease - Doppler ultrasound: Reduced blood flow in right leg arteries - Angiogram: Significant blockages in lower extremity arteries - Blood work: Uncontrolled blood glucose levels; Abnormal lipid profile  Plan: Immediate vascular consultation is recommended for possible intervention given the severity of symptoms and to prevent limb loss. This could include angioplasty or surgical bypass. He will continue hypertension and dyslipidemia management with medication adjustment as needed. It is highly advised that Mr. Johnson's type 2 diabetes be better managed to support wound healing. He will also be advised cessation of smoking  started on a graded exercise therapy  and provided diet modifications. He might also benefit from consultation with a podiatrist for wound care.   This problem representation is constructed to provide an overview of Mr. Johnson's case  summarize his condition  support a potential diagnosis  and guide treatment plans effectively. However  the information should be construed as hypothetical and not medically diagnostic in any manner.
7,7,1,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial1,Patient Information:  Mr. C  an 82-year-old African-American male  presented to the emergency department complaining of severe pain in his left leg  which had intensified over the week. The patient resides in a living care facility in the city and has a history of smoking a pack of cigarettes per day for over 60 years  having quit 4 years ago.  Past Medical History:  Mr. C has a significant medical history including poorly-controlled Type II Diabetes Mellitus for over 15 years  hypertension  coronary artery disease- status post coronary artery bypass surgery six years prior  chronic kidney disease stage III  and a confirmed 10-year history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affecting both lower limbs  primarily the left leg.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  Mr. C’s left foot was found to be cold to the touch  barely grasping any detectable pulse. There were visible signs of gangrene on the lateral aspect of the foot and the leg showed signs of reduction in hair growth  both indicative of poor blood supply to the area. He had a loss of protective sensation as confirmed by the inability to sense monofilament touch on most parts of the foot. His blood pressure was slightly elevated  and blood glucose was poorly controlled.  Diagnosis:  Following a series of diagnostic measures  including Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  Doppler ultrasound imaging and Computer Tomographic Angiography (CTA)  a clinical diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) was confirmed. The ABI was less than 0.40  and the Doppler showed diminished bi-directional flow pattern in the lower extremity arteries  while the CTA revealed multiple arterial lesions and a significant blockage in the distal left superficial femoral artery.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Given his age  multiple co-morbidities  and the extent of the disease  it was concluded that Mr. C was not a suitable candidate for revascularization. He was instead managed with aggressive risk factor control measures. His analgesic regimen was optimized for pain management  and he was given intravenous antibiotics following the diagnosis of wet gangrene. Measures were initiated towards optimizing his blood glucose control and improving his overall cardiovascular health.  Outcome and Follow-up:  The patient's foot pain showed moderate improvement with the new pain management regimen. Despite difficulties  the patient’s blood sugar levels were better controlled with an altered antidiabetic regimen. He was referred to a nutritionist to help manage his dietary intake and improve his control of diabetes. Palliative care services were also provided to the patient to manage the disease progression psychologically. The patient was scheduled for weekly follow-ups.  Given the severity of the disease progression and patient's overall health status  a multi-disciplinary team involving vascular surgery  endocrinology  cardiology  dietetics  and palliative care was formed for his future course of treatment. The option of amputation was discussed  but the patient was initially hesitant. Therapeutic decision-making was challenging considering the patient’s co-morbidities  however it was decided that this would be kept as a last resort  following determination of his potential for healing post-amputation and his overall risk from surgery.   In conclusion  this was a case of advanced critical limb ischemia emphasizing the need for early detection and rigorous disease management in patients with a high-risk profile  such as longstanding smokers  diabetics  and hypertensive individuals  to prevent potentially debilitating outcomes.
7,7,2,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial2,Title: Severe Critical Limb Ischemia in a Diabetic Patient with Hypertension  Patient Detail: Mr. M  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  presented with severe pain in his left leg  rest pain  and non-healing ulcers in the foot. He reports the pain to be persistent  unrelieved with rest  and increasingly disruptive to his sleep. The patient is a retired mechanic  a smoker for 40 years with a moderate alcohol intake  and has a sedentary lifestyle.  Past Medical History: The patient has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 15 years  that is managed with Insulin and Metformin. He has also been treated for Hypertension for 8 years with Ramipril. He neither had a history of peripheral arterial disease nor any arterial interventions.  Clinical Findings: On inspection  Mr. M's left foot exhibited non-healing ulcers on the big toe and heel with discoloration of the surrounding skin. There was an absence of pulse palpation in the left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. The Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was evaluated at 0.4 on the left side  confirming severe ischemia. Pain-free walking distance was significantly reduced (<50 meters). Mr. M also reported intermittent claudication of his right leg.  Investigative Studies: An angiogram showed severe occlusions of the left superficial femoral artery  and less severe stenosis of the right femoral and popliteal arteries. The left infrapopliteal arteries were also occluded.  Treatment & Prognosis: Revascularization was proposed as the preferred treatment strategy considering the severity of symptoms and findings. Endovascular therapy couldn't be done due to the severity and location of the blockage  leading to a decision for bypass surgery. After proper risk assessment and necessary preparation  a femorotibial bypass using a vein graft was performed. The patient was also prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy and a statin  with optimization of his diabetes and hypertension management.  The postoperative period was uneventful and follow-up at 1 month demonstrated improved ischemic symptoms and start of ulcer healing. The patient was enrolled in a structured exercise program and advised on lifestyle modification including dietary changes  smoking cessation  and regular foot care.  In conclusion  this report emphasizes the association between diabetic angiopathy  sedentary lifestyle  and smoking in the severe progression of critical limb ischemia. Early detection and aggressive multidisciplinary management can yield suitable outcomes  however  the importance of primary prevention should be underscored to all patients  particularly those with multiple predisposing factors.

7,7,3,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial3,Patient Information  Patient: 64-year-old Caucasian male Home Town: New York City  Presenting Condition  The patient presented with a three-month history of incipient left foot pain  which was progressive and primarily noticed at rest. It was accompanied by paresthesia and numbness  primarily at night. Additionally  the patient reported a loss of appetite  weight  and intermittent episodes of fever.  Medical  Personal  and Family History  The patient has a history of cigarette smoking (30-pack year history)  controlled hypertension  and type 2 diabetes  which was diagnosed 8 years prior and has been controlled with metformin. He reported no history of heart disease  pulmonary disease  or renal disease in himself or his immediate family. His family history does report numerous cases of type II diabetes and different types of cancer (lung  colon).  Physical Examination and Clinical Test Results  On examination  the patient’s vital signs were generally stable: pulse 80 beats per minute  blood pressure 140/80 mm Hg  temperature 37.8°C  and respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute. His left foot was cold with diminished sensation and poor distal pulsation. Digital gangrene was evident on the distal phalanx of the left big toe. Distal pulses in the left lower limb were absent  and dusky discoloration was present below the mid-shin level. The right lower extremity was normal with palpable pulses. Blood tests showed increased WBCs  and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Peripheral angiography was performed which showed multi-level peripheral artery disease with a complete blockage of blood flow in the left limb from the mid-popliteal artery to the foot.  Diagnosis  Considering the clinical manifestation  examination findings and angiography results  the patient was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI) in the left limb.  Treatment and Follow-Up   The patient was immediately started on an intravenous antibiotic regimen for infection management along with low molecular weight heparin for anticoagulation. He underwent successful infrainguinal bypass surgery to restore the blood supply. After the operation  he was monitored in the hospital for a couple of weeks  and his pain noticeably improved as his foot warmed up. The patient was subsequently discharged with instructions for continual foot care  blood sugar management  and a strict cessation of smoking. Regular follow-up assessments for limb examination  wound care  and re-vascularization patency have been arranged.  The patient’s history of smoking and type II diabetes  both risk factors for CLI  highlights the importance of further research and awareness of the preventive measures in such high-risk individuals.
7,7,4,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial4,Patient Information  A 75-year-old African American male presents to the outpatient clinic with complaints of rest pain and non-healing ulcers on his left foot. His weight is 89 kg and he is 5’7” tall. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history. He also has a past medical history significant for type II diabetes mellitus.  Clinical Findings  On physical examination  the patient appears uncomfortable and in distress. His vital signs are stable. Lower-extremity examination reveals a temperature difference between the right and left foot. The patient’s left foot is cool to touch with prolonged capillary refill  and non-palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are observed. The foot has multiple necrotic ulcers covering the plantar surface and lateral malleolus with no signs of infection surrounding the ulcers. There are no palpable femoral pulses. Sensation is intact but decreased to both pressure and temperature. Peripheral neuropathy is observed on monofilament exam.  Diagnostic Assessment  A series of diagnostic studies were conducted on the patient. Non-invasive studies include an Ankle Brachial Index (ABI)  which resulted in a low ABI of 0.4 on the left while a normal ABI of 1.2 on the right. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the lower extremities depicted severe atherosclerotic disease of the left common iliac artery with multiple blockages in the popliteal and anterior tibial arteries. Bypass grafting deemed impossible due to multiple blockages. The nature and extent of the disease confirmed the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI).   Therapeutic Intervention  Following diagnosis  a below-knee amputation was suggested as the viably best option. Patient and family were reluctant to proceed with this plan initially but agreed after counselling about the risks and consequences of a non-operative approach. During the postsurgical period  the patient received intense rehabilitation care and continued to take aspirin  high-intensity statin and his diabetes medication.  Follow-up and Outcomes  At the two months follow-up  the patient’s stumps had completely healed without signs of infection. He has also started using prosthetics under the supervision of a rehabilitation specialist. His pain has disappeared and the HbA1C level is 7.2%. The patient is now ambulating with the use of a wheelchair and is in the process of receiving physical therapy for prosthetic fitting and ambulation training.   Patient's Perspective  The patient expressed concern about his ability to manage at home. He was referred to a social worker to outsource homecare resources  and the diabetic nurse planned for home visitation for insulin training. He was grateful for the information received and decision made to improve his quality of life.  Conclusion  This case illustrates the severe manifestations of peripheral arterial disease and the importance of early diagnosis and preparing patients for potential life-altering decisions. Regular screening and early interventions are crucial  especially in high-risk patients with diabetes and smoking histories. 
7,7,5,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial5,Title: Severe Peripheral Artery Disease Resulting in Critical Limb Ischemia - A Case Report  Introduction:  This case report involves a 73-year-old Caucasian man with severe Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) leading to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Patient Information:  The patient is a retired 73-year-old Caucasian male residing in Chicago  Illinois. He is a former chain-smoker with a 50 pack year history but quit smoking ten years ago. He has a medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 18 years  Hypertension for 20 years  Dyslipidemia for the past 15 years  and Chronic Kidney Disease stage 3. His surgical history was remarkable for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 8 years ago. His body mass index was 29.1 kg/m2  indicating obesity. His regular medications include Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for dyslipidemia.  Clinical Findings:  The patient presented with a six-month history of severe excruciating pain in his left lower extremity  even while at rest. He experienced the most pain in his foot. He reported having non-healing ulcers on the foot over the past three months  associated with noticeable skin color changes. Physical examination revealed an absent dorsalis pedis pulse and a barely palpable posterior tibial pulse on the left lower extremity. The affected limb was observed to be cold with a pallor appearance  and gangrenous changes were seen in the toes.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Ankle-Branchial Index (ABI) showed a low value of 0.3 on the left side  confirming severe PAD. Doppler ultrasound showed a monophasic waveform suggestive of significant stenosis in the left femoro-popliteal and tibial arteries. Angiography further corroborated these findings and revealed complete occlusion of the left popliteal artery and severe stenosis distally.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Given the severity of limb ischemia and the onset of gangrene  an immediate decision for emergency left lower limb revascularization was made to salvage the limb. Unfortunately  an attempt using endovascular techniques was unsuccessful due to the critical nature of the disease. Finally  a left below-knee amputation was performed with the goal of relieving pain  preventing systemic sepsis  and improving his overall quality of life. Post-amputation  rehabilitation support and prosthetic interventions were planned for the patient.  Follow-up:  The postoperative period was uneventful  with good pain control and wound healing. The patient was subsequently discharged and referred to cardiac and diabetic specialists for optimization of his cardiovascular risk factors. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled every three months. A prosthetic fitting was arranged  and the patient was connected with the physiotherapy department for further rehabilitation.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the aggressive nature of PAD in patients with diabetes and the importance of early detection and treatment. Primary care physicians must remain vigilant about PAD  especially in high-risk patients. A multidisciplinary approach involving various specialists is crucial in managing such complex patients. 
7,7,6,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial6,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-year-old female patient with a history of Diabetes and Hypertension  Case Report:  Patient Information: The patient  a 68-year-old Caucasian female with previous medical history significant for Type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and peripheral artery disease (PAD)  presented to the hospital with extreme pain in her right lower extremity.  Clinical Findings: The patient reported experiencing a gradual increase of pain in her right lower extremity over the past few weeks  especially when walking. Subsequently  it continued to escalate even at rest. Other symptoms noted were a decrease in skin temperature in the affected limb  absence of peripheral pulses  and discoloration  ranging from pallor to cyanosis when elevated and erythema when dangled  indicative of severe circulatory deficit.  Diagnostic Assessment: An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test was performed which scored significantly less than 0.4 and non-invasive vascular study demonstrated diminished flow to the distal extremity. The pulse volume recordings  with severely decreased amplitude  were also indicative of severe PAD. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was done for further assessment and revealed a complete occlusion in her right Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) along with multilevel tibial disease. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Therapeutic Intervention: Due to her critical condition and her risk factors (diabetes and longstanding hypertension)  a decision was made for the patient to undergo endovascular revascularization with Drug-Eluting Balloon (DEB) angioplasty and stenting. Following the procedure  antiplatelet therapy with Aspirin and Clopidogrel was initiated for the management of the disease.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: Post-procedure assessments showed immediate amelioration in her symptoms. Pulse presence was reported in her right foot at discharge. On her 4-week follow-up  she reported significant improvement in her right leg pain. Examination showed healing of minor wounds noticed at the presentation. An ABI reading was improved. The patient was referred to a diabetic educator and a dietitian for better control of her diabetes and hypertension.   Patient Perspective: The patient was satisfied with the treatment outcome and was relieved from the disabling pain that significantly affected her quality of life. She realized the importance of controlling her diabetic and hypertensive conditions and pledged to follow a healthier dietary pattern.  Conclusion: This case underlines the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of risk factors in patients with PAD to prevent the progression to critical limb ischemia. The multidisciplinary approach towards the condition can drastically improve patient outcomes and their quality of life.
7,7,7,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial7,Patient Information:  Mr. X  a 78-year-old Caucasian male was presented to our hospital with complaints of chronic progressive pain in his left lower limb. He is a retired high-school history teacher  married with two children  and a resident of North Carolina. He has a 45-year history of smoking and enjoys drinking socially. He is not currently working and denies the use of any illicit drugs or medications.   Medical History:  Mr. X has been diagnosed with hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago. Mr. X has been complying with antihypertensive medications  statins for hyperlipidemia  and metformin for diabetes mellitus but control is suboptimal. He had an MI (Myocardial Infarction) 5 years ago and was treated with PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention). He has no known allergies to drugs or food.   Presenting Complaints:  The patient first noticed rest pain 6-months ago. He complained of severe pain in his left leg that seemed to worsen at night. He also stated that the pain worsened after walking and was partially relieved by dangling the leg off the bed. He attributed the pain initially to his age but as the pain progressively worsened  he decided to seek medical help.   Physical Examination:  On physical examination  there was evident pallor  reduced temperature  and decreased hair growth in the left leg. Peripheral pulses were not palpable in the left foot. No ulcerations or gangrene were visible  but the foot appeared dusky. A comprehensive cardiovascular examination was also conducted due to his previous MI.  Investigations:  Doppler ultrasound examination was done for both legs which confirmed significantly reduced blood flow in the left leg  indicative of severe ischemia. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) indicated a score of less than 0.40 in the left leg suggestive of critical limb ischemia. Further angiography indicated severe multi-level atherosclerotic occlusive disease.   Case Management:  Initially  conservative management including optimal glycemic  blood pressure  and lipid control was attempted but symptomatic relief was minimal. Given the severity of his disease and symptoms  he was evaluated for revascularization interventions. He underwent a successful endovascular intervention which included angioplasty.   Follow-up:  Post-procedurally  his rest pain resolved considerably and blood flow to the left foot improved. He received smoking cessation counseling  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia management education. He was advised to continue his aspirin and statin therapy and was discharged to continue physical rehabilitation at home. Mr. X is scheduled for follow-up visits to monitor his progress and to manage any potential complications.   This case highlights the importance of early recognition of critical limb ischemia in patients with a long history of smoking and poor control of diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Timely intervention can drastically reduce the risk of limb amputation and improve quality of life.

7,7,9,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial9,Title: A Case Report of Critical Limb Ischemia in a High-Risk Patient  Abstract:  We present a case report of a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient with a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) who was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI). The diagnosis and treatment strategies highlighted in this report emphasize the clinical features  diagnosis  and management of CLI in a high-risk patient.  Case Presentation:  Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired truck driver  a current smoker with a 50-pack year history  who presented to the hospital with a three weeks history of sharp and severe burning pain in the right lower extremity that worsens at night. He also reported that non-healing ulcers were present on the right foot with a significant loss of hair on the legs and feet. He has a known history of T2DM  PAD  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia.  Clinical findings: On physical examination  the right lower extremity was severely pale with a noticeable temperature differential below the knee area. Pulses were weak in the right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial areas  and absent in the popliteal area. Tissue loss was evident on the right foot with deep non-healing ulcers. There was also significant reduction in tactile and pain sensation in the right lower extremity indicating peripheral neuropathy.  Diagnostic assessment: The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was indicative of severe PAD  measuring 0.40 in the right extremity. An arterial Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremity showed severe stenosis in the distal right superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery. An angiography confirmed the occlusion of these arteries. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was high (9.2%).  Therapeutic intervention: Revascularization was considered critical. Given the substantial risk factors and expected poor wound healing  an endovascular approach was favored over surgical bypass. Angioplasty was performed along with stenting of the occluded artery. Following the procedure  his pain notably reduced. In conjunction with a diabetic team  his T2DM was better controlled using a mix of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. A multidisciplinary team approach was used for wound care and management  incorporating a dietician  podiatrist  and physiotherapist.  Follow-up and outcome: The six-month follow-up showed gradual improvement in extremity perfusion  significant reduction in pain  and wound healing progress. ABI was 0.85 in the right leg  indicating improved arterial perfusion. More aggressive risk factor modification was implemented  including smoking cessation counseling and better glycemic control.  Conclusion: This case demonstrates the necessity of an interdisciplinary team and multifactorial approach when managing a high-risk CLI patient. Furthermore  it highlights the importance of aggressive management of modifiable risk factors  even in late-stage disease. The significant role of endovascular procedures in limb salvage in high-risk patients is also emphasized. 
7,7,10,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial10,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 65-year-old Female with Multiple Comorbidities  Patient Description: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian female  who is a retired schoolteacher. She is currently residing in Dallas  Texas. She presented with a severe  persistent pain in her right lower extremity  lasting for several weeks. Apart from her current presentation  she reported having episodes of intermittent claudication  characterized by pain/discomfort in the calf muscle during exercise or walking  which tends to subside at rest. She also noticed the formation of ulcers on her right foot that were slow to heal.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant medical history which includes hypertension (HTN)  type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  and hyperlipidemia. She was diagnosed with hypertension around 30 years ago and T2DM around 20 years ago and had been maintaining these conditions relatively well with prescribed medications (amlodipine 5mg for HTN  metformin 1000 mg for T2DM  and Atorvastatin 20mg for hyperlipidemia). She also reported a smoking history of around 40 pack-years but had quit 10 years ago.  Diagnosis: Based on her clinical condition  imaging studies  and the results of a Doppler ultrasonography showing diminished blood flow in her right lower extremity  she was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI) due to peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Management: The cardiology team consulted. They started her on a regimen of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) to prevent thrombosis. Considering her severe symptomology and poor quality of life  and after discussing the risks  benefits  and alternatives  the patient agreed to undergo revascularization surgery.  Postoperative: The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and reported significant relief from her previously severe  consistent limb pain. The wounds started to show signs of healing.  Follow up: She was advised to attend regular follow-up appointments  continue her medications and engage in lifestyle modification such as maintaining a balanced diet and adhering to a regular exercise program to control her blood sugar levels  blood pressure and lipid profile.   Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of prompt diagnosis and effective management of CLI  particularly in patients with multiple comorbidities. It also highlights the imperative role of regular follow-ups and effective lifestyle modifications in the management of underlying diseases which might prevent the progression of the disease and improve patient outcomes.
7,7,11,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial11,Case Report:  Patient Initials: J.P. Sex: Male  Age: 67 years Race: Caucasian  Presenting Complaint: J.P. presented at the hospital with severe pain in his right lower extremity. The pain level was constant and  according to the patient  worsening over the last few weeks. The pain was initially intermittent but became constant over the past week. He also reported non-healing ulcers on his right foot and intermittent night pain that was relieved by hanging the foot over the edge of the bed.  Past Medical History: J.P. has a known history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosed five years ago and has been non-compliant with his prescribed medications. Additionally  he has a 45-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 20 years ago with sub-optimal glycemic control. The patient also suffers from hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both managed with medications. However  his compliance with the prescribed regimen is poor. He has no history of any surgeries.  Physical Examination: Examination of the right lower extremity revealed a weakly palpable pulse in the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. An ulcer measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter was observed on the lateral side of his right foot. The extremity was cold to touch  and there was a noticeable pallor on elevation. Pulses were normal in the left lower limb. No signs of gangrene were noted.  Diagnostics: With the patient's history and physical findings  the suspected diagnosis was critical limb ischemia. An ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) was performed  showing an index of 0.4 on the right side  confirming severe ischemia. Computed tomography angiography revealed severe stenosis in the right superficial femoral artery  popliteal artery  and tibial arteries.   Management: J.P. was managed urgently with revascularization with angioplasty and stenting of the occluded right superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery. He was also started on antiplatelet therapy  statins  and advised for aggressive glycemic control for his diabetes and smoking cessation. In addition  he was referred to a wound care team for the management of his foot ulcer.  To summarize  this case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and management of peripheral arterial disease  as well as patient adherence to medication and lifestyle changes. Special attention needs to be given to high-risk patients  such as those with diabetes and a smoking history  to prevent the progression of the disease to critical limb ischemia.
7,7,12,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial12,Case Report  Patient Information: Mr. A  a 65-year-old African American male  presented with severe pain in his right lower extremity. The patient is a regular smoker  having smoked his entire adult life  currently averaging one pack per day. He has been a known case of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type 2 for the last 20 years  along with hypertension  and has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) for which he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting approximately five years ago.   Clinical Findings: Mr. A reported increased difficulty in walking due to the pain  consistent with claudication  and explained that it had been progressively worsening for the past six months. In recent weeks  he noticed sores that weren't healing on his right foot and a prominent discoloration of the skin. On physical examination  the right foot was cold to touch with weak pulses. There was a non-healing ulcer on the right big toe  and the skin was pale with areas of dark discoloration suggesting gangrene.   Diagnostic Assessment: An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was conducted which showed a significantly reduced reading on the right. Peripheral angiography demonstrated severely compromised blood flow in the right lower extremity  shorter arterial segments filled with thrombotic material and multiple areas showing total occlusion. These findings confirmed the clinical suspicion of critical limb ischemia (CLI).   Therapeutic intervention: The patient was commenced on conservative management initially with antiplatelets (Aspirin) and statins and control of his blood sugar levels and blood pressure. However  due to the severity of his condition  a decision was made to proceed with surgical intervention. Mr. A underwent successful endovascular therapy with angioplasty and stent placement to restore perfusion in the affected limb.   Follow-up: At the patient’s follow-up appointments  he demonstrated notable improvement. The foot ulcer began showing signs of healing  and the pain had significantly reduced. The patient was then referred to cessation counsellor to address his smoking habit. He is currently under observation and is scheduled for regular follow-ups in cardiology and vascular surgery.   In conclusion  this case illustrates the importance of early detection and management of CLI  particularly in patients with known risk factors such as smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and a history of coronary artery disease. The maintenance of blood sugar levels  blood pressure and aiding patients to quit smoking plays a crucial role in mitigating further risk.

7,7,15,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial15,Patient Profile:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male who is a retired firefighter was referred to the vascular department with a history of critical limb ischemia (CLI). His chief complaints included intermittent pains in both his feet  with difficulty in walking and complete rest in the past two months. On initial questioning  the patient also reported wounds that had persisted for the last six weeks. His history of pain and wounds was consistent with his condition.   Past Medical History:   The patient had been diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus Type II and Hyperlipidemia five years ago. His medications included Metformin and Simvastatin. Moreover  he also had a pack-a-day smoking habit that spanned 40 years but had stopped smoking a year ago. A year before  the patient had suffered a myocardial infarction for which he underwent successful coronary stenting and was on low dose Aspirin. There was no history of hypertension  cerebrovascular accidents  or any known allergy.   The family history was significant with his father having died of a myocardial infarction and his mother from a stroke  both in their early 70s. Consequently  the patient seemed aware of his risk factors and understood the need for lifestyle modifications and compliance with medications.  Examination and Assessment:  On physical examination  his Body Mass Index (BMI) was 31 indicating obesity. Upon inspecting the feet  minor gangrenous changes were observed on his left foot's big toe with rest of the feet showing dusky discoloration. Decreased sensation to touch and pain were noted upon neurological examination of the feet. Pedal pulses (Dorsalis Pedis and Posterior Tibial artery pulses) were palpable but significantly weakened bilaterally.   Doppler ultrasound revealed decreased ankle-brachial index (ABI) with values of 0.5 and 0.6 in the right and left leg respectively (normal range: 0.9 - 1.3). Severe arterial occlusive disease was inferred from these values. A computed tomographic angiography confirmed the presence of bilateral peripheral arterial disease involving the arteries below the knee.  In summary  this patient presented with typical symptoms of CLI which were corroborated by physical examination and radiological findings. His diabetes  hyperlipidemia  past smoking habit  and family history were significant contributors to the development of severe peripheral arterial disease and subsequently CLI.
7,7,16,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial16,"Title: A Case Report: Presentation and Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-Year-Old Male  Introduction:  This is a case report of a 68-year-old Caucasian male with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  highlighting the importance of early detection and aggressive management of this potentially life-threatening condition.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Chronic Kidney Disease (stage 3)  and Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). He presented to our clinic reporting worsening pain in his left lower extremity that had been persisting for six months. The pain was described as a strong squeezing sensation that escalated during movement and slightly relieved during rest.  On examination  the left lower limb was notably colder than the right  with observable pallor and delayed capillary refill. Pulses were absent on the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. Foot examination revealed the presence of an unhealed ulcer on the lateral aspect of the left foot.  Demographic data include the patient being a lifetime resident of the local area  a retired steelworker  married with three adult children. The patient is a smoker (40 pack-years) and drinks alcohol occasionally.  Clinical Findings:  Doppler ultrasound demonstrated significantly reduced blood flow in the left lower extremity. Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) in the left lower extremity was 0.40.  Blood work revealed a mildly elevated creatinine and slightly uncontrolled glucose levels.   Diagnosis:  Given the history  physical examination  and diagnostic findings  the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) of the left lower extremity was made.  Treatment:  The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon and was advised an immediate surgical intervention. A successful below-the-knee (BTK) amputation was performed. Post-operatively  he was started on a tailored regimen for better control of his diabetes and renal condition. A smoking cessation program was initiated alongside comprehensive rehabilitation services.   Outcome and Follow-Up:  The patient was able to go home two weeks post-operation and was seen every two weeks for the first three months during the initial post-operative phase for wound care and rehabilitation. At his 6-month follow-up appointment  the patient reported marked improvement in his overall symptoms.  Discussion:  CLI is a severe stage of PAD  leading to a high rate of limb loss if not treated aggressively. The patient's history of diabetes  smoking  kidney disease  and prior PAD made him a high-risk candidate for CLI. This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition and intervention  considering all risk factors  to optimize outcomes in these patients. It further reiterates the need for lifestyle modification and strict control of comorbid conditions.   Patient's Perspective:  """"The pain was unbearable. I'm glad the doctors were able to help me and manage it. It's hard adjusting after the operation  but I am happy that I am no longer in constant pain. I understood I had to stop smoking and better control my diabetes. I see this as a second chance at leading a healthier life"""". "

The patient lives in a rural part of the country with limited access to healthcare facilities and is an ex-tobacco user with a history of 40 pack years. He is widowed with three adult children  retired after working as a farmer for most of his life.  Medical History: Mr. X has a known history of hypertension and dyslipidemia for the past 10 years  managed on anti-hypertensives and statins. He was diagnosed with Type II diabetes 8 years ago  currently managed with oral hypoglycemics. In his family history  early coronary artery disease in his father and a brother was noted. There was no history of deep vein thrombosis  chronic liver or renal disease.  Presenting Signs and Symptoms: The patient reported an escalating sharp and burning pain in his right lower limb  predominantly at the foot and calf region. The pain was worse at night and somewhat relieved by hanging the foot down from the bed. Associated symptoms included non-healing ulcers on the foot  discoloration  and coldness of the limb to touch.  Physical Exam: Examination revealed a thinner right leg when compared to the left  with noticeable muscle atrophy. There were palpable femoral pulses  but the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were absent. Perfusion was poor  with the skin appearing bluish-purple and cold to touch. A non-healing ulcer surrounded by areas of gangrene was noted on the lateral side of the right foot.  Diagnosis: Based on the patient's presenting complaints  medical history  physical findings  and investigations including Doppler ultrasound which revealed stenosis of the right popliteal and anterior tibial arteries  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to peripheral artery disease was established.  Management: Aggressive risk-factor modification was initiated  including tight glucose  hypertension  and cholesterol control. Smoking cessation was reinforced  though the patient was already a former smoker. The patient was prescribed clopidogrel and cilostazol to reduce clot formation and improve blood flow. Pain management was addressed with analgesics. To restore circulation  he was scheduled for an angioplasty. Eventually  a minor amputation was done  given the presence of gangrene.  Course and Outcome: The foot ulcer was regularly dressed to promote healing. After the angioplasty and amputation  the patient's lower limb pain significantly reduced. The patient was enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program  with a plan of physiotherapy to improve muscle strength and gait.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the importance of proactive management of risk factors for CLI  especially in patients with a significant history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and dyslipidemia. The necessity for timely medical intervention to ensure functional recovery and stave off the requirement of more severe amputations is emphasized.
7,7,18,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial18,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a Diabetic Patient - A Case Report   Patient Information: Mr. A  a 63-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the outpatient department of our hospital.  Medical History: Mr. A had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension for the past 15 years. He had a history of tobacco use but quit 10 years ago. His medications included metformin  lisinopril  and a statin. There was no known history of peripheral arterial disease in the family.   Presenting Symptoms: The patient reported right lower limb rest pain for the past 4 months and a non-healing ulcer on his right foot for the past 2 months. The pain was severe enough to hinder sleep and regular day to day activities. The patient's glucose levels were inconsistently monitored and poorly controlled.   Physical Examination: On examination  his right foot was cool to touch  with a non-healing gangrenous ulcer measuring 2 cm in diameter on the forefoot. His right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were not palpable. A palpable pulse was noted in the left foot. Mr. A's foot also exhibited dependent rubor (redness) and pallor (pale color) upon elevation - a sign of severe ischemia.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) was 0.40 on the right side and 0.98 on the left side. Doppler ultrasound revealed severe multilevel peripheral arterial disease in the right lower limb. CT angiography of the lower limbs confirmed the bilateral peripheral arterial disease with right-side dominance. Mr. A was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI) of the right lower limb.  Treatment: Considering the severity of the patient's condition  prompt action was required to revascularize the limb and control the infection in the foot. Endovascular treatment was planned. An angioplasty was performed successfully on the right limb  significantly improving the blood flow. The right foot ulcer was debrided  and culture-specific antibiotic therapy was initiated.  Follow Up: At the 1-month follow-up  the patient reported relief from rest pain and showed signs of healing of the foot ulcer. He was advised to maintain strict glycemic control and attend regular follow-ups.   This case highlights the importance of early detection and management of peripheral vascular disease & CLI among patients with type 2 diabetes. In the presence of chronic conditions such as diabetes  careful monitoring and management are crucial to prevent severe complications such as CLI. With timely and appropriate management  even severe cases of ischemia can show improvement  as seen in Mr. A's condition.
7,7,19,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial19,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 59-year-old Male  Patient Profile: The patient is a 59-year-old Caucasian male who presents with symptoms of critical limb ischemia. His past medical history reveals a long chronicle of cardiovascular disease  diabetes mellitus (Type II)  and hypertension. He smoked for 35 years and has quit smoking 3 years ago. He lives with his wife and has two adult children. His profession was a long-distance truck driver which made daily physical exercises difficult. There is a family history of peripheral arterial disease.  Presenting Complaints: The patient arrived at the clinic complaining of increasing levels of pain in his lower right extremity of 6 weeks duration. The pain had the characteristics of claudication initially (relieved with rest) but over 2 weeks progressed to being more persistent and dramatic (rest pain). He also pointed out that over the last week  the foot had become noticeably cold to touch and appeared to be slightly discolored.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  his right leg was found to be cool  bluish-purple in color distally  and had a weak to nearly absent dorsalis pedis pulse. Skin of the distal portion of the right limb appeared glossy with noticeable hair loss. Neurological examination of the limb revealed decreased sensation  particularly in the foot region. Pain was accentuated when the leg was at an elevated position.  Investigations: An ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) was performed  yielding a result of 0.38 on the right side indicative of severe peripheral arterial disease. A Doppler ultrasound confirmed the ABI findings and revealed significantly reduced blood flow in the right lower limb. A subsequent magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) showed severe  multi-segment  infra-inguinal arterial occlusive disease which was consistent with the patient's clinical picture of critical limb ischemia.  Management: Following the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia  the patient was initially managed with medication  including low dose aspirin  and statins. A well-balanced diet was recommended with appropriate dietetic referral. As he was diabetic  his glucose levels were closely monitored and diabetes management strategies were reviewed. The possibility of surgical and endovascular interventions  like peripheral bypass grafting and angioplasty  were discussed with the patient and his family.  Follow-up: The patient was scheduled for regular follow-up appointments to monitor his progress. The persistent pain  the slightly blue appearance of the foot along with the poor perfusion seen in his investigations suggests that close monitoring and imminent active intervention will be essential to limb preservation.  This case highlights the imperative nature of early detection and intervention in the management of critical limb ischemia. Robust risk factor management  patient education  and efficient medical or surgical interventions can prevent major outcomes like limb loss and associated morbidities.
7,7,20,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial20,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a Female Patient with Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus  Introduction:  Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is categorized as a severe obstruction of the arteries which critically reduces blood flow to the extremities. This report presents the case of a 68-year-old female patient with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus who presented with critical limb ischemia.  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old African American female who resides in a suburban neighborhood. She reported to the hospital with signs and symptoms consistent with critical limb ischemia. The focused history revealed worsening continuous rest pain in the lower extremities  specifically her right leg over the past week  associated with non-healing ulcers on her foot.  Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 25 years ago and has been on medication therapy  which she admits not taking regularly. Unfortunately  her diabetes has been poorly controlled throughout the years  as evidenced by her recorded HbA1c level which was consistently above 8%. She also has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia but no previous events of coronary artery disease  stroke or peripheral arterial disease. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.  Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  the patient’s right foot was found to be cool  with pallor orienting at rest. When elevated  the foot became pale  and dependent rubor was noticed when it was dependent. Distinctive skin lesions were noticed  including non-healing ulcers on the medial aspect of the foot. Pulses in the foot were not palpable and intermittent claudication was positive. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test showed a value of less than 0.5  indicating severe peripheral artery disease.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An angiogram confirmed the critical limb ischemia  diagnosing severe stenosis in the right lower limb. Labs revealed an elevated HbA1c level of 9.8%  which highlighted the patient’s uncontrolled diabetes.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient underwent a successful right lower limb angioplasty and stent placement to restore the blood supply. Concurrently  better diabetes control was targeted with adjustment of her oral therapy and insulin initiation.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  Post-procedure  she reported alleviation of rest pain. Regular foot care and strict sugar control were advised. She was discharged with medications including antiplatelets  statins  and insulin with close outpatient follow-ups for her diabetes and foot care.  Conclusion:  This case demonstrates the heightened risk of developing critical limb ischemia in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Clinicians should remain vigilant and proactive in managing diabetes and promoting peripheral vascular health. 
7,7,21,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial21,Title: A Report on a Case of a 75-year-old Male with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: The patient is a 75-year-old Caucasian male  currently retired. He is married and lives with his wife. The patient  a former smoker  has a history of high blood pressure  type II diabetes mellitus  and dyslipidemia. He gave up smoking ten years ago but had been a smoker for approximately 50 years. His medications include metformin  amlodipine  and simvastatin. There is no history of any allergic reaction to medications or substances. He is also under medication for lower back arthritis.   Presenting Problem: The patient was admitted to the hospital complaining of severe pain in his left lower extremity even while in a resting state  which had been increasing in intensity over the past few weeks. He also reported skin discoloration and intermittent claudication  sleep disturbances due to pain  and had reduced mobility due to pain and discomfort. He noticed the pain was worst while he was lying down and improved when he hung his leg off the side of the bed.   Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed weak pedal pulses  presence of non-healing ulcers on the foot  and coldness of the affected limb. His toes appeared dusky  indicative of poor blood supply. His blood pressure was slightly elevated  and his Fasting Blood Sugar was also on the higher end. Lab findings showed an increased HbA1c level with a slightly elevated CRP level indicating an inflammatory process. His lipid profile was likewise showing slight elevation.   Diagnostics: Doppler Ultrasound of the left lower extremity revealed markedly decreased blood flow consistent with critical limb ischemia. CT Angiography further validated peripheral arterial occlusive disease prominently in the left lower limb's posterior tibial and peroneal arteries.   Therapeutic Intervention: Considering the patient's medical history and the critical nature of his present condition  a multidisciplinary team assembled for his treatment. The patient underwent endovascular revascularization procedure  with angioplasty of the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries  followed by a period of medically managed care for metabolic control  pain management  and wound care. He was also referred to a dietician and physiotherapist for further help.  Outcome: The patient responded well to the angioplasty procedure  as evidenced by improved symptoms and follow-up Doppler Ultrasound showing improved blood flow. His pain was controlled with medications  and the ulcers showed signs of healing. The patient and his family were educated about the disease  its implications  risk factors  and the crucial need for dietary changes  physiotherapy and regular monitoring. They were also made aware of the risk of reoccurrence and were advised on early recognition of symptoms.  This case again emphasizes the fact that early detection and prompt treatment of critical limb ischemia is essential for a better prognosis and prevention of limb loss  being particularly important in patients with a history of multiple risks such as advanced age  diabetes  hypertension  and dyslipidemia like in this case.

Her family history is rich in hypertension  diabetes  and cardiovascular accidents.  Findings: Physical examination of the patient revealed a non-healing ulcer on her big toe. Doppler ultrasonography confirmed poor blood circulation her left foot  and an ankle brachial index of 0.4 on her left lower extremity confirmed the ischemia. Diagnostic angiography further showed extensive atherosclerosis of the distal left popliteal artery and complete occlusion of the tibio-peroneal trunk and its branches. An examination of the right foot did not exhibit any abnormal findings.  Management and Follow-up: Given the extent of arterial disease and numerous cardiovascular comorbidities  open surgical revascularization was deemed too high risk for the patient. The decision was made by the vascular team to proceed with endovascular revascularization. The patient underwent successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Immediately post-operation  the patient reported an alleviation of pain  and there was a significant improvement in the coloration and temperature of her left foot.   The patient was discharged a week after the procedure with antibiotics  analgesics  and a modification to her antiplatelet regimen to include clopidogrel. A referral was made to a diabetes nurse educator and a dietitian to optimize her diabetic control and nutritional support. Patient X was followed up at regular intervals  with significant improvements in her ambulatory function and healing of her foot ulcer over several weeks.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of critical limb ischemia in an elderly  multicomorbid patient. Success in this case was due to the multidisciplinary approach in managing her disease  providing medical control of her comorbidities  and giving appropriate endovascular intervention combined with comprehensive wound care.
7,7,23,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial23,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-Year-Old Male   Demographics:  - Patient Initials: J.G - Age: 68 years old - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired military officer - Residency: Urban area  Washington D.C.  Medical History:  The patient has a significant past medical history including Type II Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 18 years ago  Hypertension for the last 20 years  Dyslipidemia  and a history of heavy smoking for 40 years but quit five years ago. He had no known allergies and his surgical history includes appendectomy at age 24.  Presenting Problem:  J.G presented to the emergency department with increasing pain in his left lower limb for 4 weeks. The pain  initially intermittent and provoked by walking  gradually worsened over the past week  becoming persistent  severe  and unrelieved by rest. The patient also reported experiencing episodes of coldness in his left foot  together with numbness and some motor weakness  accompanied by a loss of hair in the affected area.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  the left lower limb appeared paler compared to the right  was cold to touch and had absent distal pulses. Hair loss was noticed on the distal third of the left lower limb. A non-healing ulcer was observed on the left foot. The motor strength of the limb was 3/5  and the patient exhibited decreased sensation to fine touch and pinprick below his left knee.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was conducted revealing an ABI of 0.4 in left limb suggestive of severe peripheral artery disease. Doppler ultrasound of the limb demonstrated severe stenosis in the left superficial femoral artery. Further angiographic studies confirmed the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Therapeutic Intervention:  Following the diagnosis  the patient was started on medication including antiplatelets and painkillers. He underwent successful revascularization surgery  where the stenotic areas in the femoral artery were bypassed. Postoperatively  the patient was managed on dual antiplatelets  statins  beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for hypertension. Glycemic control was attempted under the guidance of an endocrinologist  with the patient receiving insulin therapy and dietary counseling.  Outcome:  Following the surgery  the patient’s symptoms improved considerably within a week. His pedal pulses seemed stronger on examination. The ulcer on the foot started showing signs of healing with adequate wound care. To prevent recurrence  the patient was advised to continue his medication  control his diabetes  and lifestyle modification was emphasized.  This case is an illustration of how CLI can present and emphasizes the need for vigilance in vascular assessments  particularly in patients with multiple risk factors such as diabetes and history of heavy smoking. The successful management of this case further underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving vascular surgeons  endocrinologists  and wound management team in managing CLI.
7,7,24,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial24,Patient Information:   Mr. X is a 68-year-old African-American male with a past medical history of type II diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He is a 45 pack-year smoker  who quit 10 years ago and reports alcohol only on special occasions.  Clinical Findings:  Mr. X initially presented to the vascular surgery clinic with a 3-week history of severe pain in his left lower extremity  particularly at rest  associated with non-healing ulcers on his left foot toes. The pain would often disrupt his sleep and was only partially relieved by strong analgesics. He reported noticeable color and temperature changes in his left foot  with it becoming pale and cold compared to the contralateral foot. He lost approximately 8 pounds over the same course of time due to a decreased appetite from his severe pain.  Diagnosis:  Upon physical examination  his left foot was noticeably cooler and paler than the contralateral foot  with diminished pulses in the left pedal and popliteal arteries. His ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.5 on the left and 0.92 on the right. An angiogram revealed a large blockage in the left femoral artery extending into the popliteal artery. Based on clinical findings  reduced ABI  and angiogram results  he was diagnosed with Critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Treatment:  In consultation with the vascular surgery team  it was decided to perform an aortobifemoral bypass graft to restore blood flow to the left lower extremity as interventional procedures were unlikely to be successful considering the severity and extensity of the disease. The patient was educated about the serious nature of his condition and surgical plan.   Mr. X successfully underwent the aortobifemoral bypass graft surgery. Post surgery  he had regular appointments with a dietitian in order to manage his diabetes and was also seen by a podiatrist and physical therapist. He was started on statin and aspirin for long term management of his existing cardiovascular risk factors.  Follow-up:  Four weeks after the surgery  his pain at rest had significantly improved  and his foot ulcers showed signs of improvement. His follow-up ABI was 0.82 on the left  indicating improved perfusion in the left lower extremity after the bypass surgery. He continues to visit the clinic for follow-up evaluations and has shown a commitment to maintaining lifestyle modifications to manage his existing cardiovascular disease risk factors.  This case illustrates the importance of prompt recognition and treatment of CLI in order to prevent limb loss and to improve patients’ quality of life.
7,7,25,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial25,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a Patient with a History of Diabetes and Peripheral Arterial Disease   Introduction:  Critical limb ischemia (CLI) and its related complications are often associated with underlying health conditions such as Diabetes Mellitus and Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). We present a case of a 70-year-old male with a significant medical history  including hypertension  peripheral arterial disease  and diabetes mellitus type II complicated by CLI.  Patient Information: A 70-year-old Caucasian male patient presented to the emergency department with a complaint of severe resting pain in his right lower extremity. The patient defined his pain as a dull and burning sensation in nature which had worsened over the past few weeks. He additionally reported difficulty in walking and a noticeable loss of hair on his right limb. His past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus type II  hypertension  and PAD. He was a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed an extremely pale  cold  and pulseless right lower extremity. The limb was hairless and showed ulcers on the extremities. Vascular examination revealed diminished dorsalis pedis and popliteal artery pulses on the right side. The patient's Ankle-brachial Index (ABI) was 0.4–indicative of severe blockage and risk for CLI.  Diagnostic Assessment: A contrast angiography was performed  which showed multi-level obstructive arterial disease affecting the iliac  femoral  and below knee popliteal arteries. Blood results showed elevated fasting blood sugars and HbA1C of 8.6%  suggestive of poor glycemic control.  Interventions: Under a multidisciplinary team including a vascular surgeon  interventional radiologist  and endocrinologist  the patient was started on a dual antiplatelet regimen with Aspirin and Clopidogrel  high-dose statin  and his diabetes was managed with appropriate insulin therapy. He underwent successful endovascular revascularization using balloon angioplasty and stent implantation. Post-operation  he was monitored closely for any signs of infection or necrosis. Options for a more aggressive surgical intervention were held as a last resort should he not improve after the endovascular procedure.  Outcome and Follow-up: At follow-up  the patient's pain significantly abated with an improved ABI of 0.9. The patient was maintaining good glycemic control  and his ulcers were showing signs of steady healing without any evidence of necrosis.  Conclusion: This case demonstrates that in patients with significant medical history  the manifestation of severe symptoms like rest pain and non-healing ulcers should alert clinicians about the potential risk of critical limb ischemia. Early recognition  appropriate diagnostics  aggressive risk factor management  and intervention can improve the patient's quality of life and outcomes.
7,7,26,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial26,Case Report on Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information   The patient is a 65-year-old male. He is Caucasian  retired  and with no known allergies. He resides in a suburban community with his wife. Other demographic information includes a smoking history of 30 pack-years but quit 10 years ago. He also drinks alcohol occasionally and he used to work as a factory worker.  Presenting Issue   The patient presented to the clinic with complaints of pain in his right lower extremity  which has become increasingly severe over the past three months. He reported intermittent claudication initially  but his symptoms have progressed to a point where he experiences ischemic rest pain. The pain is mostly located in his foot  particularly at the heel. The patient has noticed that the pain intensifies when lying flat and usually relieves partially when his leg is in dependence. He also reported that his foot never regains its natural color even when he stops walking and appears reddish-blue. The foot is cold to touch and the pulses cannot be palpated. He also developed a non-healing ulcer on the right foot on the great toe a month ago.  Past Medical History  The patient has a significant history of type II diabetes mellitus  which was diagnosed 10 years ago. His blood sugar level has been poorly controlled. His medical history also includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a history of myocardial infarction five years prior with subsequent bypass surgery. He had been compliant with his medications for these conditions  including insulin  a beta-blocker  a statin  and an ACE inhibitor.  Clinical Findings   The physical examination revealed a painful ulcer on the right great toe that measures approximate 2cm in diameter surrounded by skin discoloration. Distal hair loss on the right lower extremity is noticeable. Pulses on the common and distal parts of his right lower extremity are not palpable. The Doppler signals are severely diminished  suggestive of arterial insufficiency.   Diagnosis   The patient was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI) based on his clinical findings and symptoms. CLI is a severe obstruction of the arteries which reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to cause severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.  Treatment  The patient was immediately referred to a vascular surgeon for further management. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and/or bypass surgery would probably be warranted based on the advanced status of his disease.  Summary  This case depicts severely uncontrolled peripheral vascular disease leading to CLI  likely due to the combination of diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a history of smoking. It emphasizes the imperative need for a holistic approach to ensuring optimal vascular health  including strict control of diabetes  cessation of smoking  and management of other vascular risk factors. 
7,7,27,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial27,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. A  a 68-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Issue: The patient presented with symptoms of critical limb ischemia (CLI) including severe pain in the lower leg  non-healing sores on the left foot and lower leg  and noticeable changes in color and temperature of the lower leg and foot.  Medical History: Mr. A has a long-standing history of smoking and heavy drinking  dating back almost 45 years. He suffers from hypertension and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 12 years ago  for which he is currently taking Metformin. He also has stage III chronic kidney disease and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). His surgical history includes a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) intervention five years ago. There has been no noted history of strokes or transient ischemic attacks.  Investigations: On physical examination  his left foot and lower leg appeared significantly paler than their counterparts. His right foot showed normal perfusion while the left foot was noticeably cooler  indicating poor blood flow. Doppler examination of the lower limbs revealed an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.4 on the left side and 0.9 on the right. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the lower extremity showed multi-segmental occlusive disease in his left leg.  Treatment and Management: Given the patient’s clinical symptoms  history  and diagnostic test results  he was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia. The multidisciplinary team decided on an endovascular intervention to restore blood flow due to the multi-segmental disease and critical state of his limb.  Simultaneously  Mr. A was strongly advised to quit smoking and limit alcohol intake. He was referred to a dietician to help manage his diabetes and obesity through a controlled diet plan  and was advised for active participation in a structured exercise program. His antihypertensive medications were adjusted aiming optimal control.   Follow-up details: A significant decrease in pain was reported immediately after the endovascular procedure. At a one-month follow-up appointment  Mr. A's left lower limb was warmer  with better coloration. His wounds showed signs of healing. He was strictly adhering to diet plan and medication  but had difficulty quitting smoking.   This case underscores critical limb ischemia as a severe state of peripheral arterial disease  frequently associated with smoking  diabetes  and chronic kidney disease. It highlights the importance of an early diagnosis  aggressive management  and improvement in lifestyle for better outcomes.
7,7,28,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial28,Title: A Case Report of Critical Limb Ischemia in a Male Patient with Long-Standing History of Type 2 Diabetes and Current Tobacco Use  Patient Information: A 65-year old Caucasian male presented to the outpatient vascular clinic with a three-week history of progressive right leg pain  predominantly at rest  along with noticeable discoloration and coldness of the right lower extremity.  Medical History: The patient has a documented history of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which has not been well-controlled for about 20 years. He is also a chronic smoker for more than 40 years  currently consuming about 1 pack of cigarettes per day. The patient had a remote history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the ipsilateral limb diagnosed seven years prior  but was asymptomatic until recently. His other medical conditions include hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient’s right foot exhibited a cold temperature when compared to the ipsilateral limb  with delayed capillary refill and noticeable skin discoloration involving the entire limb distal to the knee. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were markedly diminished. Multiple non-healing ulcers with necrotic tissue were observed on the toes.  Diagnostic Assessment: An ankle-brachial index (ABI) test revealed an index of less than 0.3  considered severe peripheral arterial disease. Doppler ultrasound demonstrated severe atherosclerotic disease in the right lower limb with a complete blockage below the knee. A tissue sample from the foot ulcer demonstrated gangrene without signs of bacterial infection.  Therapeutic Intervention: Given the severity of ischemia  invasive revascularization (angioplasty or bypass surgery) was discussed with the patient. An initial attempt to do endovascular recanalization was unsuccessful. The patient was scheduled for a below-knee amputation to prevent upward progression of the gangrene.  Follow-up: The patient responded positively post-surgery and expressed relief from rest pain. A multidisciplinary team including a diabetologist  physiotherapist and a counsellor were involved in post-operative care. The patient was enrolled in smoking cessation and diabetic control programs.  Conclusion: This case demonstrates the importance of prevention and early intervention in patients with known risk factors such as type 2 Diabetes and smoking to avoid severe outcomes related to chronic limb-threatening ischemia. Critical limb ischemia represents the end-stage peripheral arterial disease that can cause significant morbidity if not managed appropriately and timely. Multidisciplinary care and patient education play critical roles in the management of such chronic illnesses.

7,7,30,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial30,Title: Case Report: An Elderly Female with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information:  Ms. L  an 87-year-old Caucasian female  was admitted to the Department of Vascular Surgery in our hospital with a one-month history of worsening pain  especially during the night in her right lower limb.  Clinical History:  Ms. L has a known history of hypertension  which is well controlled with Amlodipine  10mg daily  and obesity with a BMI of 35. She was also diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus  which she has been managing with Metformin  1000mg two times daily  for the last 15 years. The patient reported long-standing history of intermittent claudication. Her lipid profile was within the upper normal limit  with mildly elevated LDL cholesterol. Prior to this admission  she had never smoked  did not consume alcohol  and has a sedentary lifestyle. No family history of ischemic disease was reported.  First Presentation:  Ms. L presented a non-healing ulcer on her right heel  measuring 2x2 cm with extensive necrosis centrally  surrounded by erythema and induration. There were signs of minor infection but no signs of systemic inflammatory response or sepsis. She also described severe rest pain  especially during the night  and she was unable to place her foot in a dependent position. Her right foot was cold to touch  with weak pedal pulses and reduced capillary refill time. Her left foot demonstrated a palpable popliteal pulse with reduced pedal pulses.  Diagnosis:  The patient underwent a Doppler ultrasound which revealed significant calcification of the arteries throughout all three segments of the right lower limb  with multi-segment occlusion in the superficial femoral artery  and tibial and peroneal arteries. A diagnosis of critical limb ischemia secondary to peripheral artery disease was made based on her clinical presentation and Doppler ultrasound findings.  Management:  The patient was managed conservatively initially with the administration of intravenous antibiotics  pain management  and supportive wound care  followed by revascularization screening. Due to her age  underlying diabetes  and extensive calcification  her risk profile was considered high for surgical intervention. After multidisciplinary discussions  the team decided to perform an endovascular procedure.  Outcome:  The endovascular procedure was successful  with immediate symptom improvement. Complete wound healing occurred within eight weeks post-procedure. The patient continues to be monitored regularly for follow-up and is under the management of a diabetes specialist and nutritionist.  Concluding Notes:  This case underlines that the early diagnosis and timely management of critical limb ischemia are vital in the elderly population with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. A multidisciplinary approach is beneficial to enhance patient care and prognosis.

He’s retired and lives with his wife in rural northern Kentucky. He’s of average build and does not smoke  but acknowledges that he is a social drinker. He has three adult children and several grandchildren.  Past Medical History:   The patient was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes twenty years back but has had moderate control over his blood sugar levels with oral hypoglycemics. He also suffers from hypertension which is managed by a combination of lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive drugs. Along with these he has Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) diagnosed three years back. His cholesterol levels have been high for past five years and he has been undergoing treatment for the same.  Case Presentation:  Mr. J.B presented to the office with escalating complaints of pain in his right lower leg  particularly noticing enhanced pain when walking  often forcing him to stop and rest. Over the previous couple of months  he also noticed that his right foot frequently felt extremely cold and was beginning to appear more pale in color. He complained of pain at rest that disturbed his sleep. Upon physical examination  the right foot was cold to touch  with decreased hair growth  thickened toenails  and the absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.   Diagnostic Assessment & Therapeutic Intervention:  On the basis of the symptoms and history provided diagnostic tests were recommended. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was significantly reduced  revealing severe PAD in the right leg. The ultrasound showed advanced occlusion of the right femoral artery. Angiography demonstrated occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery. Considering the findings  angioplasty was conducted. Anticoagulant therapy was initiated post-procedure to prevent clot formation.  Outcome and Follow-up:  He was discharged with instruction for lifestyle modifications and proper wound care. He was also counseled about the importance of tighter glycemic control  avoidance of alcohol  regular exercise  and the cessation of cholesterol-rich food. The patient has been on follow-ups every two weeks for the past three months and there has been significant improvement in the color and temperature of his right foot. His pain has considerably reduced and he can now walk without needing to stop for rest.  Conclusion:   Critical Limb Ischemia is a serious manifestation of Peripheral Artery Disease. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are crucial to save the limb and  more importantly  the life of the patient. The case emphasizes the importance of vigilance in patients with risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  and Dyslipidemia.
7,7,33,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial33,Title: A Case of Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Patient with Co-existing Diabetes and Peripheral Arterial Disease   Patient Description:   Mr. Arthur M  a 74-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the hospital with complaints of severe pain in his left leg  particularly the calf and foot region. The patient reported that the pain was worse at night and often disturbed his sleep. Accompanying symptoms included leg numbness  slow-healing sores on the lower leg and foot  and a discernible coldness to the touch  noticeable on that limb. The patient also reported significant weight loss in the recent past.  Background:  The patient has a longstanding medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 16 years ago and is presently managed by diet control and insulin. He was also diagnosed with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) and Hyperlipidemia around ten years back. He is currently on statins and antiplatelet therapy for the same.   Mr. M has a past surgical history of an appendectomy in his 30s and corneal transplant in his right eye about five years ago. He is a former smoker  having quit 9 years ago after a 45-year pack history. He consumes alcohol socially. The patient is retired and lives alone  with regular help from home care aid services.  Family history includes coronary artery disease in his late father and a younger brother diagnosed with diabetes  hypertension and kidney disease. His mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of 68.   Clinical Findings  Upon initial physical examination  the physician noted pallor  diminished pulses in the left lower limb  and non-palpable foot pulses. Temperature difference was also noted  with the left foot being significantly colder compared to the right foot. A few ulcers  the largest approximately 2cm in diameter  were seen on the sole of the left foot. No signs of gangrene were visible.  Initial laboratory tests showed marginal elevation of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c – 8.1%)  a high total cholesterol (255mg/dL)  and LDL level at 160mg/dL. No remarkable elevation in markers of inflammation was noted. Doppler ultrasound revealed significantly reduced blood flow in the left lower limb  particularly below the knee.  Diagnosis and Risk Assessment:  Based on the presenting symptoms  medical history  physical examination  and laboratory findings  the patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The presence of PAD with underlying poorly controlled diabetes posed a high risk for developing CLI.  This case demonstrates the complex interplay of risk factors leading to progressive vascular disease. The significant history of diabetes and PAD is a crucial exacerbating factor in the patient's CLI. Prompt diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach involving vascular therapy  strict glycemic control  lifestyle modifications  and wound care could help improve symptoms and avoid limb loss. 
7,7,34,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial34,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 67-year-old Male   Introduction:   This case report discusses a 67-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension  chronic kidney disease stage 4  and active tobacco use who presents with symptoms characteristic of critical limb ischemia  an urgent circulatory state typically due to systemic atherosclerosis.   Case Report:  The patient is a 67-year-old male who complained of severe pain in his left lower leg that began three weeks before his hospital admission. The pain was described as burning and throbbing  and he rated the pain as 8 to 9 out of 10 in severity. The patient noted exacerbation of pain while walking short distances  a condition known as intermittent claudication. He reported that the pain would somewhat subside when he was at rest but never disappear completely. He also reported a lack of sensation in the involved limb and the presence of non-healing sores on the toes of his left foot.  The patient has a 30-year history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease  and he also reported a 40-pack-year smoking history. His medications included Metformin  Lisinopril  and Amlodipine. The patient does not consume alcohol and has no known drug allergies.   On physical examination  the left lower leg appeared to be pale compared to the right one and was cold to the touch. Pulses were absent in that area  and there were ischemic sores visible on the toes. There were no signs of wound infection. The patient's body mass index was within normal limits  and he did not present any neurological or cognitive deficits.   Investigations and Diagnosis:  A duplex sonogram demonstrated decreased flow to the left lower leg. Further confirmatory angiography revealed significant occlusion in the left anterior and posterior tibial arteries  confirming the suspicion of critical limb ischemia. A complete blood count  renal function test  and lipid profile were within normal limits  except for elevated creatinine levels due to chronic kidney disease.  Management and Follow-up:  An urgent endovascular procedure  including angioplasty and stent placement  was performed to revascularize the affected arteries  and the patient was started on aspirin and clopidogrel for antiplatelet therapy. Post-procedure  the improvement in circulation to the foot was apparent  and the patient reported significant pain relief.   The patient was referred to vascular rehabilitation and provided with extensive education about smoking cessation  foot care  and the importance of regular follow-up with vascular surgery and primary care. Smoking cessation services were put in place to assist him in his efforts to quit smoking.   Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of promptly diagnosing and managing critical limb ischemia  particularly in patients with pre-existing comorbidities and lifestyle risk factors. The successful management of this case depended on a combination of intervention  medication  and lifestyle modifications. Regular follow-ups will be crucial in managing his conditions and preventing the recurrence of critical limb ischemia.
7,7,35,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial35,Case Report:   Demographics: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who lives in a suburban community in the Upper Midwest. He is a retired engineer and has a history of smoking for 40 years  although he quit smoking five years ago. His body mass index (BMI) is 27.8  and he lives with his wife.  Presenting Issue: The patient presented with a one-month history of rest pain in his right foot  particularly in the toes. He noted that the pain was worse at night and was alleviated by hanging his foot over the side of the bed. He also complained of non-healing ulcers on his right foot for the six weeks. Upon examination  the right foot had visible tissue loss  and absent pulses were palpated in the foot and lower leg which indicated critical limb ischemia (CLI). His left foot showed decreased pulses but no evident tissue loss or ulceration.  Past Medical and Surgical History: The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  peripheral artery disease  and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which is well-controlled with Metformin. He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) ten years ago due to coronary artery disease. He also had a history of intermittent claudication  which has worsened in the recent past.  Diagnostic Tests: Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured for both the legs. Right leg ABI was less than 0.40  and left leg ABI was 0.90. The right foot transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) was 20mmHg whereas  on the left  it was 40mmHg. A Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremity arteries showed severely reduced blood flow in the right lower limb. Furthermore  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) revealed a long segment occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery (SFA)  popliteal artery  and tibial arteries with no significant disease in the left leg arteries.  Management: In coordination with Vascular Surgery  an urgent decision was made to perform a right lower extremity angioplasty to attempt revascularization. The patient was consented and taken to the angiography suite  where multiple lesions were addressed in SFA  popliteal artery  and one of the tibial arteries. Following intervention  the foot pulses were palpable with satisfying Doppler signals  and the patient reported significant relief of his rest pain.  Follow-up and Outcome: Over the follow-up  the patient showed a significant improvement with his rest pain resolved completely  and the foot ulcer was healed with wound care over three months. He was advised to continue his medications including antiplatelet and statin therapy. He was also recommended to adhere to a strict diabetic diet and involve in physical activities to improve overall limb health and to prevent disease progression.   Conclusion: This case illustrates the importance of timely detection and management of CLI in preventing severe complications  such as limb amputation.

Clinical Findings: On physical examination  he had a diminished peripheral pulse  cold extremities  loss of hair on the lower limbs  and bluish discoloration of toes. The right foot had three ulcers  two at the tip of digits two and three  and one on the heel  all involving the full thickness with underlying necrotic tissue and no signs of infection. His body mass index was 29.6 kg/m2  and the rest systemic examination was unremarkable.   Diagnostic Assessment: Complete blood count  renal function  and liver function tests were within normal limits. Blood glucose and HbA1c levels were 275mg/dL and 9.8% respectively. Doppler ultrasound revealed severe stenosis at multiple levels in the lower-limb arteries. Confirmatory angiography showed a long-segment occlusion in most sections of the right femoral  popliteal  anterior and posterior tibial arteries  and left anterior tibial artery obliteration. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement was 0.3 on the right side indicating severe ischemia.  Therapeutic Intervention: The decisions were made to start the patient on aggressive atherosclerotic risk factor management. This included high-dose statin therapy  tight glucose control and the use of antihypertensive. In addition  surgical revascularization was planned  and after discussion among the interdisciplinary team and with the patient  an attempt of endovascular revascularization was decided  as a minimally invasive procedure posed fewer risks for him. He underwent successful angioplasty of the right limb.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Nevertheless  due to the extensive ischemic changes in the foot  he ended up undergoing amputation of the second and third digits. Antipyretic  analgesics  and antibiotics were administered postoperatively  and pain was managed effectively. Dressings were changed regularly  with the wound grade improving gradually. After rehabilitation  he was recommended for regular follow-up visits to assess graft patency and foot care.  Patient Perspective:  The patient was relieved of his resting pain in the amputated foot  was stable during regular follow-ups  and his quality of life improved considerably.  Informed Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of his medical data for this case report.   Conclusions:  This case illustrates the correlation between diabetes mellitus  peripheral artery disease  and the eventual development of critical limb ischemia  highlighting the necessity of aggressive risk factor management and timely vascular intervention.

His symptoms were progressive in nature  beginning approximately six months ago and included intermittent claudication. He eventually developed foot ulceration  non-healing skin wounds and gangrene over several toes. The patient additionally complained of significant weight loss over the past few months.  Background Information:  He has a medical history of type 2 diabetes for 18 years  hypertension  chronic kidney disease  dyslipidemia  and he is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history. His diabetes was poorly controlled with a latest hemoglobin A1c value of 9.5%.   Clinical Examination:   On examination  the right lower extremity was cold compared to the contralateral side. The pulses in the right foot (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial) were not palpable and were unrecordable on Doppler examination. The right foot had a gangrenous patch over the first toe  extending to the dorsum of the foot with dry necrotic margins. The left foot pulses were reduced but palpable.  Investigations:  Peripheral angiography revealed multi-level occlusive peripheral arterial disease with total occlusion of the right distal superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery. Also noted were diffuse disease and several areas of subtotal occlusion in the right anterior tibial and peroneal arteries. Similar lesions were found in the left leg  albeit to a lesser extent.  Management and Outcome:  After an extensive discussion of the treatment options  the patient underwent successful endovascular intervention with balloon angioplasty and stenting to his right superificial femoral artery  right anterior tibial artery and right peroneal artery. He had a marked improvement following the intervention with resolution of his rest pain. Despite this  the patient eventually underwent a minor amputation of his gangrenous first toe two weeks post-procedure. Postoperative treatment included comprehensive wound care and intensive rehabilitation. He is currently treated with long-term antiplatelet therapy  aggressive diabetes and lipid management  and has been advised to quit smoking.  Discussion:  This case highlights the significance of early detection and intervention in patients with critical limb ischemia  particularly in patients with risk factors like diabetes  smoking  hypertension and dyslipidemia. Despite successful revascularization  the patient had to undergo minor amputation due to the extent of tissue damage at presentation.

This case report discusses a 67-year-old male patient recently diagnosed with CLI  to better understand the manifestation  progression  treatment options and prognosis of this disorder.  Patient Presentation: Mr. X  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to our clinic with a two month history of rest pain in his left foot and non-healing wounds on his left toes. He described his rest pain as severe  located mainly in the toes and soles  and worsening at night. He also reported an inability to walk more than 30 feet without experiencing extreme leg discomfort  a condition known as claudication.   Past Medical History: He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  diagnosed at the ages of 52 and 57 respectively. He has been a smoker for the past 35 years  but reduced to 10 cigarettes per day after his diabetes diagnosis. His father suffered from a peripheral arterial disease and his mother had type 2 diabetes. There is no history of any other significant disease in the family.  Examination: His blood pressure was 155/90mm Hg and other vital signs were stable. Lower extremity examination revealed weak pedal pulses in the left foot  and dry gangrene was noted on the second and third toes of left foot. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Laboratory tests including blood count  renal  liver  and coagulation profile were within normal range except for HbA1c (8.2%). Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.45 on the left side suggesting severe ischemia  consistent with CLI. Subsequent arterial Doppler and angiography demonstrated severe occlusive disease in the lower extremities  particularly the left limb.  Management: The patient was medically managed with dual antiplatelet therapy  statins  and pain management. Effective glycemic control was achieved using insulin therapy. He underwent revascularization via percutaneous transluminal angioplasty  following which his rest pain reduced significantly. The non-healing foot ulcers were addressed by wound care services. The patient was advised to quit smoking and referred to a diabetic educator for better management of diabetes.  Conclusion: This case highlights the classic presentation of CLI in a patient with multiple risk factors  including long-term uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and a significant smoking history.

7,7,40,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial40,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a Geriatric Patient with Co-existing Pathologies  Patient Information: Mr. M is a 78-year-old Caucasian male  a retired schoolteacher by profession  living in upstate New York. His primary complaint was the chronic non-healing ulcer on the right foot  which started almost three months back.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed ten years ago  which is maintained on oral hypoglycemic agents along with dietary modification and regular exercises. He also has Hypertension for the past 8 years and Hypercholesterolemia  controlled by antihypertensive and statins respectively. He quit smoking five years ago and is a teetotaller. There is no familial history of any similar presentation or any coronary artery diseases or stroke. He's had a cholecystectomy two years ago  and other than that  his surgical history is unremarkable.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a temperature of 36.8 C  pulse 80/minute  blood pressure 140/90 mmHg  consistent with his history of hypertension. Oxygen saturation was recorded to be 96% on room air. An ulcer approximately 3cm x 4cm with purulent discharge was noted on the dorsal aspect of the right foot. Pedal and dorsalis pedis pulses were notably absent on the right foot  with presence of severe pain at rest in the right lower limb.  Diagnostic Assessment: Given the patient's clinical picture  a suspicion of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made. Lab results revealed elevated blood glucose levels and an abnormal lipid profile  consistent with his history of diabetes and hyperlipidemia.   An Angiogram was performed  which indicated extensive occlusion of right lower limb peripheral arteries. Confirmatory diagnosis of CLI secondary to peripheral artery disease complicated with diabetic foot ulcer was concluded.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initially treated conservatively with aggressive wound care and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics to manage the ulcer. To manage his CLI  a successful revascularization through balloon angioplasty was performed  followed by strict control of his other co-existing disease.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: Regular wound dressings and antibiotics led to a gradual improvement in the ulcer. Strict control of his blood glucose and lipid levels were maintained to avoid further complications. The patient has been instructed on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and regular follow up. He continues on low-dose aspirin therapy and statins for hypercholesterolemia  along with his regular medication.  This case reflects the complexity of diagnosis and management of CLI in geriatric patients with multiple comorbidities. It highlights the necessity of an individualized approach in such cases  with aggressive control of co-existing pathologies to prevent worsening or recurrence of CLI.

The case highlights challenges in managing patients with multiple conditions and emphasizes the need for a balanced  comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to patient care.  Case Report:  Patient Identification: A 78-year-old Caucasian male  Presenting Complaint: Intense rest pain in the left lower limb  particularly the foot  for the last two to three months. The pain has resulted in disturbed sleep. The patient also reported worsening damage in the skin of the foot with ulcers failing to heal.   Medical History: The patient has a long-term history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and coronary artery disease. His surgical history includes coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) done 6 years ago. Therapies include Aspirin  a statin  a beta-blocker  an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor  and insulin administration.  Lifestyle: Non-smoker but used to smoke one pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years. No history of alcohol or drug misuse.  Physical Examination: Atrophic skin changes were found in the lower limbs  signifying poor distal circulation. The left foot showed two deep ulcers  one on the heel and another on the dorsum of the foot. Pedal pulses were absent in the left foot but weakly palpable on the right side.  Investigations: The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was unobtainable on the left side and was .60 on the right side. Duplex ultrasound showed severe stenosis in the left common femoral artery and more extensive disease in the left popliteal and foot vessels. Further CT angiography provided detailed delineation of the vascular disease. Lab investigations revealed poor diabetes management with an HbA1c of 8.2%.  Management: A multidisciplinary foot-care team composed a range of specialties such as diabetes  vascular surgery  infectious disease  and dietetics. Interventional radiology performed endovascular therapy  including balloon angioplasty of the left common femoral artery and popliteal artery with successful revascularization. The patient was put on broad-spectrum antibiotics to manage the existing infection. Moreover  he was advised to attend diabetes clinics and regular follow-ups with dietary advice.   Outcome: At a six-month follow-up  there was significant improvement in the foot ulcers  the intensity of rest pain  and his sleeping pattern. The department of dietetics optimized glycemic control with a revised insulin regimen and diet plan.  Conclusion:  The case emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in managing CLI  particularly among patients with multiple morbidities. CLI demands a patient-centered approach where diverse medical disciplines work together to meet the individual's healthcare needs. The overall goal lies not only in limb salvage but also in the improvement of patient quality of life.
7,7,42,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial42,"Patient Information: Mr. B.C.  Caucasian  75-year-old male  a retired construction worker   Chief Complaint: """"My left leg is extremely painful and changing color.""""  Presenting Symptoms: Excruciating pain in left leg  not abating with rest or when elevated  ulceration noticeable around the foot and ankle  and observable change in color to pale and cyanotic. Noticed a decrease in temperature (cold limb) and absence of pulsation in the distal extremities.  Past Medical History: Patient's medical record reveals a history of intermittent claudication  cardiovascular disease  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type II diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years. Records also document a 60-pack-year history of smoking  though the patient reported quitting 5 years ago.  Physical Examination: Patient appeared uncomfortable due to pain. Lower left extremity was noticeably paler than the right one  cold to the touch. Peripheral pulses were absent on the left side. A non-healing ulcer measuring 1.5 cm in diameter was noted on the lateral aspect of the left foot.  Diagnosis: Given his symptomatology and past medical history  Mr. B.C is diagnosed with advanced critical limb ischemia (CLI) of the left leg.   Work-up/Tests: Evidence of CLI confirmed through an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) showing a value of 0.35 in the left leg. Further investigation through Doppler ultrasound demonstrated severe stenosis in the left superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery. A CT angiogram revealed multiple segmental occlusions in the left tibial and pedal arteries.  Treatment: Immediate Vascular Intervention with angioplasty considered for restoration of blood flow. The patient would be placed on antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel to prevent further clotting. Pain management initiated with opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  Discussion: CLI constitutes a severe form of peripheral artery disease caused by significantly decreased blood flow to the extremities  usually due to atherosclerosis. Risk factors include a history of smoking  advanced age  diabetes  and high blood pressure  as we see with Mr. B.C. Rapid treatment is essential to improve symptoms and prevent limb loss. Invasive procedures  primarily revascularization through angioplasty  stenting  or bypass surgery  are the typical line of treatment along with risk factor modification.  Prognosis: Uncontrolled CLI can lead to the necessity for limb amputation. However  since early intervention has been solicited for Mr. B.C.  potential chances for limb salvage appear promising. "

He is a widower with three adult children and resides in a suburb within New York City. He is insured under a private health insurance plan.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with severe pain in the right lower leg and foot. He has noticed an increasing intensity of pain over the last few weeks and was also distressed by a non-healing wound (ulcer) on the forefoot of the same leg.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 12 years ago  along with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) for which he was on oral medications. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he is taking Amlodipine and Atorvastatin  respectively. He quit smoking 10 years ago and takes moderate alcohol periodically. He was previously diagnosed with transient ischemic attack (TIA) 3 years ago but had no recurrences. He is allergic to Penicillin.  Clinical Findings: Examination revealed that the right lower limb was cold to touch as compared to the other limb. The limb was pale and pulses in it were impalpable. An ulcer was found on the forefoot of the same leg. No necrotic tissue or foul smell was noted.  Investigations: The patient's lab results showed elevated blood glucose  hemoglobin A1c  and lipid profile. Doppler ultrasonography of the right lower limb showed significantly reduced blood flow indicative of ischemia. Angiography revealed advanced occlusion in the femoral and popliteal arteries.  Diagnosis:  Based on the patient's symptoms  history  physical examination  and investigation results  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made.  Treatment and Outcome: The patient was managed with strict glycemic control  analgesia for pain and intravenous antibiotics to prevent infection of the ulcer. The patient was then referred to a vascular surgeon who performed a common femoral artery to popliteal artery bypass using the autologous saphenous vein. Post-surgery  the patient's lower limb pain was significantly reduced and the limb appeared pink and warm.  Plan for Follow-up: The patient was advised to attend regular follow-up appointments at the vascular clinic to monitor his symptoms and blood flow to the affected leg. He was counseled about the importance of lifestyle modifications  such as refraining from alcohol  continued cessation of smoking  and maintaining a diet low in saturated fats and simple sugars  and regular physical exercise if tolerated.  This case is important due to the patient's challenging past medical history that significantly complicates his CLI. It was also unique due to the patient's rapid progression from PAD to CLI  underscoring the need for rapid action in treating this debilitating disease.

He reveals a 6-month history of progressive wound worsening on his left foot  which began with a minor cut from stepping on a sharp object. Despite maintaining regular medications and wound dressings  the wound has failed to heal completely and has developed into a necrotic ulcer.  Physical Examination and Investigations: Physical examination of the left lower limb revealed absenced dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery pulses  the limb is cold with severe muscle wasting. There is a 3x4cm necrotic ulcer on the lateral aspect of his left foot. The capillary refill time of the left foot was delayed.  Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was significantly reduced  0.45 on the left side while it's normal  1.1 on the right. Doppler ultrasound reported major blockages in both the left superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery with minimal blood flow seen in the pedal vessels.  Further studies included an MRI angiogram  which confirmed the Ultrasound findings. A complete blood panel showed elevated glucose  cholesterol levels  and mild anemia.  Diagnosis and Treatment: Based on his medical history  physical examination  and results of diagnostic tests  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) was made. Revascularization was considered as the main treatment because of the severe ischemia and significant blockages found in his arteries. A collaborative decision was made  including Vascular Surgery team to perform a left leg bypass operation using his saphenous vein graft. Antibiotics were also instituted for managing the ulcer.  Outcome and Follow-up: Post-surgery  the limb perfusion witnessed significant improvement. The pain gradually subsided and the ulcer began to heal with appropriate wound care. He was advised to continue his diabetes  hypertension  and cholesterol medications alongside regular follow-up visits. He was also educated and counseled on maintaining foot hygiene and spotting early signs of limb ischemia for prompt medical evaluation.  Conclusion: This case represents the significant representation of typical critical limb ischemia in a patient with risk factors of diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Early detection and intervention can help in preventing limb loss  highlighting the importance of annual foot examinations  especially in diabetic patients. Further studies are needed to determine optimal wound care and rehabilitation for patients suffering from CLI.

Case Presentation: The patient  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented with a month's history of worsening left lower limb pain  non-healing ulcers in left foot  and difficulty in walking. Additional symptoms included numbness and weakness of the left leg. The presenting symptoms were progressive  with pain becoming severe enough to disturb his sleep at night and interfere with his daily activities. His medical history included Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which had been diagnosed two years prior  and hypertension for which he had been on medication for the past ten years. He was a former smoker having quit seven years prior but had a 30-year pack history.  Physical Examination: On examination  the left lower limb was cold  had pale discoloration and peripheral pulses (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial) were absent. There was a presence of non-healing ulcers in the left foot  but no signs of gangrene were noticed. The Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) measurement was less than 0.3 in the left lower limb  revealing a severe reduction in blood flow.  Investigations: Doppler ultrasonogram of the left lower limb arteries confirmed the presence of occlusive disease in the left superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery. CT Angiogram performed subsequently showed a long segment occlusion of the above-mentioned arteries and multiple stenosis in the left leg's distal arteries.  Management and Outcome: The patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) and was started on intravenous heparin for immediate management. He received intense glycemic control for diabetes. After discussion with the Patient and his family  the decision was made to proceed with surgery. A successful femoropopliteal bypass surgery was performed using an autologous great saphenous vein graft. Following the surgery  the patient showed significant improvement in terms of reduced pain  rapid improvement of ulcer healing  and increased mobility.   Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of early detection and aggressive management of CLI  particularly in patients with long-standing diabetes and hypertension.

Physical examination revealed a weak pulse in both radial and dorsalis pedis arteries and digital gangrene on the first toe of the right foot. Due to persistent symptoms  lack of normal blood flow  and indicative signs such as pain at rest and non-healing sores  our preliminary diagnosis was critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Past Medical History: The patient is known to have hypertension for the past 10 years and has been on routine antihypertensive therapy. He was diagnosed with Becker Muscular Dystrophy 15 years ago  with progressive muscle weakness reported  particularly affecting his lower onsets. The patient also has a history of heavy smoking (40-pack years). He was taking oral losartan  felodipine  and simvastatin for the management of hypertension and has been on corticosteroids intermittently for the muscular dystrophy. There was no reported history of diabetes  coronary artery disease  or cerebrovascular accident.  Relevant Investigations: Peripheral angiogram showed severe multi-level arterial disease  with occlusion of the right common femoral artery  superficial femoral artery  and popliteal artery. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.5 on the right side and 0.7 on the left side  confirming peripheral artery disease. The pulse of the lower limb was not palpable below the groin on both sides.  Management Plan: Considering the patient's age  medical history  and severity of the disease  a multidisciplinary team proposed conservative non-surgical management initially  which involved optimal medical therapy  pain control  and wound care. The medical therapy was mainly aimed at increasing the blood flow in the lower legs and feet by including antiplatelet and antihypertensive drugs.

7,7,48,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial48,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a Patient with a History of Long-standing Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus  Patient Profile: The patient is a 72-year-old African American male residing in San Francisco  CA. He is a retired real estate agent and lives with his wife in a single-family home. The patient is a non-smoker  does not consume alcohol  and denies any drug use. His family history is significant for diabetes mellitus from his paternal and maternal side.   Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of rest pain in the right lower extremity  particularly intense at night. The pain was accompanied by non-healing ulcers on the right foot becoming progressively worse over the past two months. He also reported a diminished sensation in his lower limbs along with increasing difficulty in walking.  Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus twenty years ago but has been poorly controlled according to his clinic records. He also has a history of hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor and diuretic combination. The patient was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia but was irregular with his statin consumption.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the right foot appeared pale with dusky toes and palpable coldness. Peripheral pulses in the right foot were absent. There were two ulcers on the plantar foot: one beneath the first metatarsal head with erythema  warmth  and foul-smelling discharge  and another on the heel. Bedside Doppler confirmed the absence of flow in the right lower extremity; however  the left lower extremity had a normal flow pattern.  Diagnostic Assessment: In line with the clinical assessment and the patient’s medical history  an ankle-brachial index (ABI) test yielded a result of 0.3 on the right side  reinforcing the preliminary diagnosis of right limb critical limb ischemia (CLI). An angiogram further revealed multi-level severe peripheral artery disease (PAD) consistent with diabetes-induced vascular disease.   Clinical Course: Due to the severity of the ischemia and the limb-threatening nature of the condition enhanced by the presence of ulcers  an urgent peripheral artery angioplasty was performed  with the placement of stents in the femoral and popliteal arteries. The patient was then started on dual antiplatelet therapy and low molecular weight heparin.   Patient’s outpatient medications were reviewed  with adjustments to optimize glycemic  blood pressure  and lipid control. A follow-up schedule was also established for strict monitoring of the management plan.

Case Presentation:  Demographics: The patient  a 65-year-old African American male  is a retired steelworker with a 40-year history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. He has a past medical history significant for pericarditis  hypertension  PAD  and dyslipidemia. He is a former smoker of 30-pack-years but has quit 10 years ago; he also reports occasional alcohol consumption. The social history includes limited physical activity due to progressive claudication and a family history of diabetes and coronary disease.  Clinical Findings: The patient was complaining of worsening left foot pain over the last three weeks  with noted non-healing wounds and gangrene settling in. On examination  his left foot appeared to be cold to touch with black necrosis of his middle and distal toes and an ulcer under the heel. He reported numbness and continuous rest pain in his foot  even at night  disturbing his sleep significantly. Pedal pulses were absent on the left side and diminished on the right side.  Diagnostic Assessment: An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed  which indicated severe PAD with an ABI of 0.49 on the left side and only mild disease with an ABI of 0.91 on the right side. Duplex ultrasound showed a significant and severe stenosis in the left popliteal artery consistent with the patient's symptoms. His laboratory reports indicated HbA1c of 9.2% and elevated serum creatinine suggestive of poorly controlled diabetes and underlying renal dysfunctions  respectively. Complete blood count  coagulation profile  and liver function tests appeared within normal range.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was emergently started on broad-spectrum antibiotics  and a diagnostic angiogram was performed  which confirmed the ultrasound findings indicating the need for surgical intervention. He underwent left lower extremity bypass surgery using his own saphenous vein graft. Blood glucose was aggressively managed with insulin therapy during the hospitalization.  Outcome and Follow up: Post-operative recovery was uneventful. He required rigorous wound care during the stay and was discharged with a full course of antibiotics and upcoming outpatient follow-ups scheduled.

7,7,52,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial52,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 74-Year-Old Type II Diabetic Female  Introduction   Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe form of peripheral artery disease that is typically characterized by continual leg pain. It usually affects elderly individuals  often associated with type II diabetes mellitus. This case report focuses on a 74-year-old female patient diagnosed with CLI alongside her battle with diabetes.  Patient Information  A 74-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the hospital reporting of severe  burning leg pain that is persistent even while at rest. Additional symptoms included noticeable numbing and coolness in her left foot  accompanied by discolored skin and leg muscle atrophy.   Clinical Findings  Upon physical examination  her foot had no palpable pulse and exhibited signs of ulceration. A non-healing wound was identified on her left heel. Capillary refill time was delayed  and she had significant pain from her foot with minimal movement.   Medical History  The patient was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 15 years ago. In the course of her medical history  she has had hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and kidney dysfunction. She also has a 10-year history of stable angina  under control with medication and lifestyle modifications. She was  in addition  a current smoker with a 30 pack-year history  which added to her condition's complexity.   Diagnostic Assessment   The diagnosis of CLI was made based on clinical presentation and complementary studies. Colour-Doppler ultrasounds confirmed an absence of arterial signals in the left foot. The ankle-brachial pressure index was less than 0.4  unequivocally indicating critical limb ischemia. A CT angiography was also performed  revealing extensive occlusive disease involving the left superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery. Laboratory findings highlighted poor glycemic control and signs of renal dysfunction.  Treatment   The patient was managed with aggressive control of her blood glucose levels and lipid profile with insulin and statin medications. Conservative management with analgesic medication was attempted initially  but due to the persistent pain and risk of losing the limb  she was referred to vascular surgery for further attempts at revascularization.  Conclusion  This case underscores the importance of controlling risk factors like diabetes  hypertension  and smoking for successful long-term management of Critical Limb Ischemia patients. Interdisciplinary collaborations between medical personnel are crucial for patients with complex comorbidities. Early diagnosis and aggressive therapeutic strategies can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of amputation.

7,7,56,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial56,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 65-Year-Old Diabetic Male Patient: A Case Report  Introduction:  Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) refers to a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs)  and has progressed to the point of severe pain  even while resting. CLI is often associated with non-healing sores or gangrenes on the lower extremities.   Patient Information: We report a case of a 65-year-old African American male who presented with a 2-month history of rest pain in his right foot and non-healing ulcer on his right big toe. The ulcer began as a small blister that gradually worsened over time. Patient's medical history revealed that he was a long-term smoker and had been living with type II diabetes mellitus for 15 years  poorly controlled. He also had a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral artery disease (PAD). There was no significant family history of either diabetes or cardiovascular disease.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed diminished pulses in the right lower extremity  with a palpable popliteal pulse. The right foot was cold to touch with signs of tissue loss and severe pallor on elevation. There was a 2 cm by 2 cm necrotic  malodorous ulcer on his right big toe. He scored 8 out of 10 on the pain scale.  Diagnostic Assessment: The patient underwent an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  which showed a result of 0.6 in the right foot and 1.1 in the left foot  confirming PAD. His Complete Blood Count (CBC)  renal and liver function tests were normal except for markedly raised HbA1c and lipid profile. Lower limb angiogram revealed chronic total occlusion of the right posterior tibial and peroneal arteries with severe calcification.  Therapeutic Intervention: Upon diagnosis of CLI  the patient underwent right lower limb endovascular intervention with angioplasty and stenting. He was also taken care of by the wound care service for the ulcer on the right big toe which was debrided successfully. Optimization of medical management included increasing the dosage of his anti-platelet therapy and statins along with stricter glycemic control using insulin.  Follow-up and Outcomes: In the subsequent weeks following the intervention  the patient's rest pain significantly reduced. Over a few months  the non-healing ulcer improved significantly. Lifestyle modifications included tobacco cessation  and an exercise regimen was recommended.  Conclusions: This case highlights the significant burden of CLI in patients with peripheral artery disease  especially if comorbid with diabetes mellitus and tobacco use. Early recognition  aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors and timely revascularization are integral for limb salvage and improving patient outcomes.

His fasting blood glucose was elevated  and HbA1c was at 8.6%  suggesting poor glycemic control.  Diagnosis:  Based on clinical findings  patient history  and investigative outcomes  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia due to advanced peripheral artery disease was made.  Treatment:  Treatment was initiated with analgesics for pain management and intravenous antibiotics for foot ulcers. Patient was counselled about the potential need for revascularization procedures  including possible angioplasty or bypass surgery. He was also advised to improve glycemic control and continue medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Follow-up:  A follow-up appointment after two weeks was scheduled to reassess the condition of his right foot and decide upon surgical intervention if necessary.   Summary:  This case is an illustration of chronic critical limb ischemia in the background of long-standing peripheral arterial disease and poorly managed diabetes. Timely intervention and management  along with comprehensive patient counseling  are critical to leaning the prognosis in favor of the patient. 
7,7,62,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial62,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Profile: A 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  residing at 382 Maple Drive  Maryland.  Presenting Complaint: The patient complained of severe  persistent pain in his right lower limb. Pain was reported to intensify at rest  particularly towards the end of the day. The patient also reported difficulty in walking due to the pain and described noticeable discoloration (darkening) of the right foot.  Medical History: The patient has been a smoker for the past 40 years and consumes alcohol socially. He has a history of type 2 diabetes and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The patient had earlier undergone balloon angioplasty for PAD in the same (right) limb three years back. The patient is also hypertensive and is under medication for the same. He reported having Hypercholesterolemia and does not have any known allergies.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a cold right foot with visible pallor  absent peripheral pulses  and a non-healing ulcer on the right great toe. An ankle-brachial index was extremely low (<0.3)  consistent with critical limb ischemia. Vascular duplex ultrasound showed total occlusions of the distal right superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries.   On further consultation with a podiatrist  the patient was diagnosed with Gangrene in the right foot and suggested lower limb amputation to prevent the spread of infection.  Baseline Investigations:  Fasting Blood sugar - 176 mg/dL HBA1c - 8.2 % Lipid Profile - Cholesterol 225 mg/dl  LDL - 140 mg/dl  HDL - 35 mg/dl  Triglycerides - 165 mg/dl Serum Creatinine - 1.4 mg/dL Resting ABI – 0.28  Treatment Outcome and Follow-up: Considering the patient’s severe pain  non-healing ulcer  and the findings of gangrene  the vascular surgeon and the primary healthcare team decided to proceed with a below-the-knee amputation. The procedure went without complications and the patient was recommended rehabilitative care to adapt to the changes.   He was advised for strict blood sugar and blood pressure control. Smoking cessation was counseled and cholesterol-lowering medications were adjusted. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up after a week of discharge to monitor his recovery and assess for any potential complications.   In the follow-up consultations  the patient's condition has shown improvement with no postoperative complications. His pain is now under control and he has been compliant with his medications and lifestyle modifications.  Conclusion: This case illustrates that prompt recognition and intervention in patients with CLI are imperative to alleviate pain and prevent worse outcomes such as limb loss. In this case  comorbidities like diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  and smoking significantly contributed to the patient's condition.
7,7,63,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial63,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a Geriatric Patient with Multiple Comorbidities: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) remains a prevalent issue with significant impact on patient quality of life and mortality rate. The complex nature of patients often suffering from multiple comorbidities makes comprehensive management a challenge in daily clinical practice. We report a case of a patient with severe CLI  who successfully managed a combination of revascularization  wound care  and optimized medical treatment.  Case Presentation: The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus (TiIDM) for 15 years and Hypertension (HTN) for ten years  presenting with severe pain in his right lower extremity  making him unable to walk without assistance. He also reported numbness and coldness of the same limb. Patient's past medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage-III  peripheral artery disease (PAD)  and ischemic heart disease (IHD) with percutaneous coronary interventions twice in the last five years.  The physical examination found pallor  coldness to touch  weak arterial pulsations in the right lower extremity. Preliminary investigations revealed moderate hyperglycemia  lipid abnormalities  and impaired renal function. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) showed abnormal values on the right side.  The patient underwent duplex ultrasound revealing multilevel occlusions in the right lower extremity arteries consistent with severe CLI. Despite a high-risk profile due to his comorbidities  after a thorough discussion with the patient and family  they opted for intervention given the severity of his symptoms and the risk of limb loss.  The iliac and superficial femoral arteries were revascularized using stents under local anesthesia. Postprocedural ABI showed improved values  and the pulsations in the right lower extremity were palpable.  In subsequent 6-months  the patient's painful symptoms resolved entirely with significantly improved walking capacity. Medication optimization  including more rigorous diabetes  hypertension  and lipid control  and dietary modifications were carried out during follow-ups. Attend sessions with the podiatric team for wound care also brought improvement in the limb's clinical appearance.   Conclusions: This case sheds light on the comprehensive management of CLI in a patient with multiple comorbidities. Collaborative management involving revascularization  rigorous medical treatment  and wound care can help improve prognosis and enhance the quality of life in such patients. It reinforces individualized decision-making based on patient's risk profile  preferences  and goals of therapy.

7,7,64,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial64,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-Year-Old Male: A Case Report  Clinical Presentation: Mr. A  a 68 year-old Caucasian male  presented to our clinic with complaints of severe rest pain in his left lower leg that had worsened over the past six months. The pain was particularly escalated at night during rest and reduced with hanging leg off the bed. Mr. A reported intermittent claudication after walking a distance of approximately 150 yards. Alongside  he reported the presence of non-healing sores on his left foot which were present for over 2 months.  The patient had a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  with intermittent adherence to medication  and a 30-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day  although he quit five years ago after being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He also had a history of hypertension that had been controlled through continuous medication for the last ten years.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a pale left lower limb with cold skin to touch  a weak distal pulse  and several non-healing ulcers on the toes of the left foot. The left foot demonstrated diminished sensation peripherally. An assessment of the right lower limb showed normal blood flow and sensation.   Laboratory findings showed an A1C of 8.5%  indicative of poorly controlled blood glucose levels. Additionally  the lipid profile was abnormal  with an increased LDL level.  The Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was measured as 0.35 on the left  suggesting severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). Doppler ultrasound of the left lower limb showed monophasic arterial waveforms with decreased systolic velocities. CT angiography confirmed severe stenosis in the infrapopliteal arteries.  Diagnosis: Combining the clinical examination  laboratory results  and imaging studies  the patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to peripheral arterial disease  significantly impacted by his longstanding diabetes and smoking history. His poorly controlled diabetes likely contributed to the development and poor healing of the ulcers on his foot.  Management and Follow-up: The patient was immediately started on medication to control his symptoms and improve his ABI  including cilostazol and clopidogrel  alongside tight diabetic control. A peripheral vascular surgeon evaluated him  and based on the comprehensive assessment  a decision was made to conduct angioplasty to improve blood flow to his foot. Mr. A was also advised to attend sessions for a comprehensive smoking cessation program. He was followed up regularly to monitor the healing of the foot ulcers and his pain control.   To conclude  this case re-emphasizes the importance of a combined approach to diagnose and effectively manage CLI  taking into account the control of systemic risk factors alongside local treatment of the affected limb.

7,7,66,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial66,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-year-old Female Patient with a History of Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension  Abstract: This report discusses the manifestation  diagnosis  and management of a patient presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI). The patient  a 68-year-old African-American female with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus  sought medical care for persistent pain  ulcers  and the development of gangrene in her right lower limb.  Case Presentation  The patient  a 68-year-old African-American female  with a notable history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus for 8 years and hypertension for 12 years  visited our outpatient department complaining of non-healing sores on her right lower limb and rest pain that had been persisting for the past three weeks. She weighed 86kg and had a height of 163cm  with a body mass index of 32.4 kg/m²  indicating obesity. She is a non-smoker and a teetotaler but has no regular exercises. Her medications upon presentation included Metformin (500mg  twice daily) and Losartan (50mg  once daily).  On examination  the patient was fully alert and oriented. Her blood pressure was 155/95 mmHg  pulse rate was 92/minute  and she had a respiratory rate of 18/minute. There were several painful  non-healing ulcers varying in size from 0.5cm to 1.5cm on her right foot. She also had a dry gangrene area of 3x3 cm at her right big toe. Pulses in her right lower limb were absent at the popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial. Distal extremity of her right leg was cold to touch and had a bluish discoloration.   Investigations  Her laboratory tests showed a poorly controlled diabetes with a HbA1c of 9.2% and a blood pressure which would classify her hypertension as stage 2. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) confirmed the presence of severe peripheral arterial disease  with an index of 0.39 in her right lower limb.  Treatment  Due to her poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension  and the extent of CLI as indicated by the ABI score  she was started on a treatment plan that includes an adjustment of her Metformin to 1000mg twice a day. She was referred to a vascular surgeon for an urgent evaluation for revascularization. A multi-disciplinary approach involving a wound care specialist for the management of her non-healing ulcers and diet and exercise counselling for weight management was also initiated.  Conclusion  This case highlights the crucial role of early identification and rigorous management of risk factors in peripheral arterial disease  especially in patients with a history of long-standing diabetes and hypertension. It also underscores the need for comprehensive management involving a multi-disciplinary approach for optimal outcomes in critical limb ischemia patients.
7,7,67,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial67,Title: Management of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 78-Year-old Diabetic Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI)  characterized by severe blockage in the arteries of the lower extremities  predominantly occurs due to peripheral artery disease. Here  we present a case of a 78-year-old male with past medical history significant for diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia who presented to the outpatient clinic with critical limb ischemia.  Case Presentation: A 78-year-old Caucasian male presented to the vascular surgery clinic with a six-week history of severe progressive pain in his right lower limb  particularly experienced at rest. The patient also reported skin discoloration and decreased temperature in his lower limb. He has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  and was a smoker with a 50-pack-year smoking history.  Physical examination revealed diminished distal pulses in the right foot  pallor on elevation  dependent rubor  and dry gangrene in the distal toe. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.3 in the right leg  indicating severe ischemia. Doppler ultrasound showed severe calcified plaque and significant stenosis in the distal superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery.   The diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was made based on the clinical presentation and investigations.  Management and Outcome: The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery unit considering the severity of his condition. He was started on dual antiplatelet therapy  statins  and was given administered antibiotic coverage due to his gangrenous toe. Smoking cessation was strongly advised.   Given the patient's significant comorbidities and severe unilateral disease  surgical revascularization was carried out as an appropriate intervention. The procedure involved balloon angioplasty followed by a femoral-popliteal bypass using a saphenous vein graft.  Pain reduction was achieved immediately after the procedure. ABI following surgery increased to 0.8 and the patient's skin color gradually returned to normal. Wound healing of the gangrenous toe was slow but progressive under wound care treatment. A multidisciplinary approach including endocrinological treatment for diabetes and lifestyle modifications was recommended for long-term management.   The patient was finally discharged with scheduled outpatient follow-ups. During the 6-month follow-up  the patient reported considerable pain relief and showed signs of foot recovery with the healed toe.  Conclusion: Critical limb ischemia is a severe manifestation of peripheral artery disease that requires prompt diagnosis and intervention. This case report highlights the importance of early recognition  aggressive risk factor management  and timely revascularization to prevent limb loss in patients at high risk for CLI  especially those with comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension.

7,7,72,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial72,Title: A Case of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 72-Year-Old Male Patient with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Peripheral Artery Disease  Case history:  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the vascular surgery department with a three-month history of severe rest pain in his right lower limb  non-healing foot ulcers  and noticeable physical impairment. His pain was exacerbated at night and by limb elevation.   The patient has a longstanding medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for over 20 years  peripheral artery disease (PAD) for 5 years  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. His T2DM and PAD conditions were being managed conservatively with oral hypoglycemic agents  statins  and antihypertensives. He is an ex-smoker  having quit smoking 10 years ago. The patient's lifestyle includes limited physical activity due to progressing claudication. His family history is significant with his father having died of a myocardial infarction in his late 70s.   Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient had significant weight loss and seemed exhausted. Inspection of his right limb revealed dry  scaly skin with distal hair loss  nails thickening  two non-healing ulcers on his right foot - one on the medial aspect of the first toe and another on the plantar aspect  and noticeable bluish discoloration (cyanosis) suggesting poor blood supply. Pulses were absent in the right popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial arteries  and significantly reduced on the left side. There were no signs of acute limb ischemia such as pallor  poikilothermia  or paralysis.  Investigations:  Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed and showed a value of 0.40 on the right side and 0.69 on the left  suggesting severe arterial disease. Subsequent Doppler ultrasonography confirmed this with significant stenotic and occlusive lesions in both superficial femoral arteries more on the right side.   CT angiography (CTA) revealed a long-segment occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery in continuity along with a significant decrease in the lumen diameter of the left superficial femoral artery.  The patient's blood tests showed HbA1c levels at 8.6% indicating poor glycemic control  mildly decreased kidney function  and slightly elevated markers of inflammation.  Diagnosis:  Based on history  clinical examination  and ancillary test results  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to peripheral artery disease was made.  Management:  The patient was started on optimal medical therapy including more strict blood sugar control  statins  and antihypertensive medication. Endovascular intervention was planned initially; however  due to patient's medical condition and preference  he was treated conservatively. The patient's condition is being monitored closely  with amputation being considered as a last resort if limb salvage cannot be achieved. 
7,7,73,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial73,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 72-Year-Old Male  Patient Profile:  The patient was a 72-year-old Caucasian male presenting with severe pain in his right lower leg that had been worsening over a period of several weeks. He was a non-smoker and had no known allergies. He had a history of hypertension managed with medication and was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes over the past 4 years. His family history was significant for cardiovascular disease (his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 64).  Chief Complaint:  The primary concern was rest pain in the right lower extremity that increased at night and often disturbed his sleep. The patient also mentioned that the temperature of his right foot was noticeably cooler than his left  indicating poor circulation. In addition  he reported experiencing a non-healing wound on his right foot that had been present for 2 months.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  the patient had abnormal skin features such as pallor  thin skin  and shiny skin on the affected lower limb. Peripheral pulses in his right foot were absent. The toe brachial index (TBI) was 0.2  indicating severe arterial obstruction. There was no detectable edema. The aforementioned non-healing wound was located on the sole of the foot  about 2 cm in diameter.  Diagnosis:  Based on symptoms  examination  and the patient's history  he was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.  Management and Outcome: The patient was admitted for revascularization surgery  including angioplasty and stent. Post-op  his symptoms noticeably improved along with increased peripheral pulses in the right foot. He was administered dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent stent thrombosis. Control of his blood glucose levels and hypertension was optimized. He was also referred to a wound care specialist for management of his foot ulcer. During the 6-month follow-up after discharge  the patient's foot wound had entirely healed  and there was significant improvement in claudication. He is continuing with regular follow-ups  monitoring his diabetes and hypertension control  and taking his antiplatelet medications.  Discussions: CLI can greatly impact the quality of life of the patients and can lead to limb amputation if left untreated. Early diagnosis and prompt intervention can significantly improve the prognosis. This case emphasizes the importance of vigilant clinical evaluation and susceptibility in at-risk populations  particularly older adults suffering from diabetes and hypertension. Regular monitoring and managing underlying conditions can prevent progression to severe stages.
7,7,74,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial74,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 65-year-old Female with long-standing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Case Report   Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe form of peripheral artery disease (PAD) presenting with chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene in the lower extremities due to a significant decrease in blood flow. It is commonly caused by systemic atherosclerosis and is often seen in patients with cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  smoking  and advancing age. Here  we present a case of a 65-year-old female with a long-standing history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) who developed critical limb ischemia.   Case Presentation: The patient  a 65-year-old Caucasoid female  with a past medical history of T2DM  hypertension (HTN)  and hypercholesterolemia  presented with complaints of rest pain in her left lower extremity for the last two weeks. She also reported intermittent tingling sensation in her left foot and non-healing ulcer on the left big toe that had been present for three weeks. She denied any history of tobacco use. However  she had poorly controlled T2DM with hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) level of 8.2%.  On physical examination  the patient’s left lower extremity was cold with a reduced pulse in the left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery. An ulcer of approximately 2X2 cm on the left big toe was noticed with no signs of infection. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) on the left side was 0.4  indicating severe limb perfusion reduction.   Investigations: The complete blood count  renal  and liver function tests were normal. Fasting lipid profile showed a high level of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL). A duplex ultrasound demonstrated severe stenosis of the left posterior tibial artery and occlusion of the left anterior tibial artery. The patient’s chronic poor glycemic control might have precipitated the development and progression of the arterial disease.  Treatment: The patient was treated with insulin for glycemic control  antiplatelet  and statins for the future prevention of cardiovascular events. A vascular surgeon performed a successful balloon angioplasty of the left posterior tibial artery enhancing blood flow to the foot.

Demographic Information: The patient is a retired teacher  currently residing in Seattle  Washington with his wife. He is of moderate financial status with good access to healthcare services.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. X reported acute pain in his right lower limb that started three weeks ago. The patient rated his pain level as a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10. The pain exacerbated when he would lie flat  but partially relieved itself upon hanging the limb over the edge of the bed. He also reported intermittent claudication while walking short distances and noticed dark discoloration on his right foot and toes.  Past Medical History: Mr. X has a history of unmanaged diabetes mellitus for 12 years  hypertension for 10 years  and hyperlipidemia. He also has history of tobacco use but quit 5 years ago. He had an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) 7 years back that was managed conservatively. His medications include Metformin 500 mg twice daily  Lisinopril 10 mg daily  and Atorvastatin 40 mg daily. His father died due to stroke  suggesting a genetic predisposition to vascular diseases.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a cold right foot with decreased sensation. The popliteal and foot pulses were not palpable on the right side while being well pronounced on the left. A 2cm non-healing ulcer was also observed at the right lateral malleolus. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was .28 on the right  and 1.15 on the left.  Diagnosis: Based on clinical findings  the patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) of the right lower limb.  Management Plan: Considering his condition  Mr. X was referred to a vascular surgeon for evaluation upon suspected Critical Limb Ischemia. A CT angiogram was suggested to assess the extent of blockage. Baseline blood tests including complete blood count  renal function test  lipid profile  and HbA1c were ordered. The patient was started on Aspirin 75mg daily  Clopidogrel 75 mg daily and Cilostazol 100mg twice daily. Pain management was initiated using Opioids and antispasmodics. The patient was also advised strict glycemic control and wound care for the ulcer.

7,7,76,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial76,Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named J.J.  who is a retired metal worker and long-term resident of an urban area in New York  United States. He is a smoker with a 45 pack-year history. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.  Presenting Complaints: J.J. presents with severe progressive pain in his right foot  particularly in the toe area and calf muscle  over the last month. He reveals a history of non-healing foot ulcers and noticeable changes in the color of the leg  turning it into a paler shade. He also reported experiencing intense pain during the night  affecting his sleep quality and disturbances in daily activities due to the pain and discomfort.  Medical History: The patient has a comprehensive medical history with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed at age 45  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. His diabetes has led to peripheral neuropathy  and he reports a history of poor glycaemic control  with recent HbA1c levels around 8.5-9% over the past two years. He has previously undergone angioplasty for a coronary artery disease ten years ago. He has remained on metformin  a statin  and an angiotensin II receptor blocker since then. He has had no other surgeries or known allergies.   Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  J.J. presented with noticeable paleness and decreased temperature in the right lower limb compared to the left  with palpable femoral pulse but absent distal pulses. He has ulcers on the right foot  two on the toes  and one on the lower medial malleolus. He has no venous insufficiency signs  and prominent peripheral neuropathy in both lower limbs is noted. Duplex ultrasound performed showed bilateral occlusions in the limb's arteries.  Diagnosis: Given the clinical presentation and medical history  particularly his long-standing uncontrolled diabetes and smoking history  the patient was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  the severe obstruction of the arteries which seriously reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.  Management and Outcome: Endovascular intervention was recommended over bypass surgery due to his comorbidities  and he has been referred to a vascular surgeon. Patient education  particularly on smoking cessation  diabetes control  and foot care  was strongly emphasized. J.J received appropriate wound care and antibiotics to control the infection of the ulcers and was continued on his current medications. Close follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor his progress.   In summary  J.J.’s case presents the significant chilling effects of uncontrolled diabetes  smoking  and resulting CLI. It emphasizes the importance of proper glycaemic control and the pivotal role of primary care in early recognition and management of CLI.
7,7,77,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial77,CASE REPORT  Patient Information:   The patient is a 68-year-old African American male with a long history of smoking  obesity  and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II. Occupation involves prolonged periods of inactivity (retired). Resides in an urban setting in the Midwest region of the United States. There is a known family history of cardiovascular disease.  Presenting complaint:  The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of continuous and severe pain at rest in the left lower leg  consistent with ischemic rest pain. The pain was present for the past week  gradually worsening  described as sharp  throbbing  manifesting even when recumbent or elevated  and unresponsive to over-the-counter analgesics. The patient reports intermittent claudication for the past year  initially while walking long distances but progressively the distance was reducing.  Examination and Clinical Findings:  On examination  his left foot was cold compared to his right. He was noted to have non-palpable pedal pulses on the left with an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) value of 0.40. The left foot showed early signs of tissue loss with dry  black gangrene of the first toe and pallor on leg elevation. A Doppler ultrasound reported severe stenosis of the left superficial femoral artery and occlusion of infrapopliteal vessels.  Management:  The patient was taken into the hospital and was initially treated with intravenous heparin for anticoagulation  pain management with opiates  and strict glycemic control for his diabetes. Following a consultation with the vascular team and gaining informed consent  an angiogram confirmed the sonographic findings of arterial occlusion. Given the patient's medical history and clinical examination  he was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).   The patient was then proceeded for angioplasty with an aim to restore blood flow and prevent the progression of tissue loss. Post-angioplasty  a significant improvement in blood flow was noted. The patient was advised lifestyle modifications and prescribed long-term anticoagulation therapy  statins  strict diabetic control  and pain management.  Discussion:  CLI is largely a consequence of peripheral arterial occlusive disease and is associated with a poor prognosis  increased amputation risk  and mortality rate due to underlying cardiovascular diseases. It often represents advanced systemic atherosclerosis with coronary  carotid  and renal artery involvement. Importantly  the presence of CLI indicates the need for an aggressive and multi-faceted treatment approach. Patients suffering from CLI are often at risk of major amputations. This patient will require rigorous and intensive follow-up care  including regular assessments of limb viability  potential revascularization needs  and maintenance of cardiovascular risk factor controls. 
7,7,78,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial78,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a Type 2 Diabetic Patient  Patient Information  Mr. Paul Thompson  a 64-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the vascular unit following complaints of severe pain in the right lower limb  which had worsened over the past four months. According to the patient  he had also noticed skin discoloration and non-healing ulcers over the same period. The patient is from Cleveland  Ohio  retired  living with his wife  and has five grown-up children. He does not smoke or consume alcohol. However  he has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  which are controlled through oral medication.   Clinical Findings  Upon examination  Mr. Thompson exhibited classic signs of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  including intermittent claudication  rest pain and gangrene. His skin was deteriorated with discoloration and skin breakdown  especially around the lower portion of the right leg. Pedal pulses were absent on the affected limb. His pain was worst during the night and typically relieved by hanging the foot over the bed.   Diagnostic Focus and Assessment  An arteriogram exhibited severe peripheral arterial blockage in the right external iliac and common femoral artery. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test revealed an ABI of 0.5 in the right lower limb  confirming severe ischemia. A comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count were normal  but the hemoglobin A1C level was 8.5%  suggesting suboptimal control of his diabetes.   Therapeutic Focus and Assessment  Per the vascular surgeon's recommendation  the patient underwent a femoral-popliteal bypass surgery to restore adequate blood supply  followed by antibiotic treatment for his non-healing ulcers. He was also referred to a diabetologist for better glycemic control.  Follow-up and Outcomes  Post-operative period was uneventful  and there was a noticeable improvement in his symptoms during the subsequent follow-ups; the pain decreased drastically  and wound healing was evident. He was enrolled in a diabetic education program to optimize glycemic control and encouraged to monitor his glucose levels regularly.  Patient Perspective  Mr. Thompson expressed relief regarding the improvement in his condition. He acknowledged his need to commit to managing his type 2 diabetes more efficiently and was motivated to learn more about preventing any vascular complications in the future.

7,7,80,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial80,Title: A Case of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 65-Year-Old Male  Introduction: This case involves a 65-year-old male of Asian descent presenting with symptoms indicative of critical limb ischemia (CLI). The patient lives in an urban setting  is a retired office worker  and is a non-smoker. There is no history of alcohol use or illegal substance use.  Patient Presentation: The patient presented with a two-week history of severe rest pain in the right lower extremity accompanied by unilateral foot ulcers that had not healed for approximately four weeks. He also complained of intermittent claudication and cold feet. His past medical history included hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 10 years  well controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents.  Physical Examination and diagnostic evaluation: Physical examination revealed a weak pulse in the right pedal and pallor in the distal parts of the right lower limb. The ulcer was located on the dorsum of his right foot  with evidence of slight necrosis and was measured to be 2x2 cm. There were no signs indicating systemic infection.   The Ankle-Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) was 0.3 on the right side compared to 1.1 on the left side  suggesting severe ischemia in the right lower limb. The duplex scan confirmed the presence of occlusive disease in the right lower limb with multiple blockages in the right superficial femoral artery and popliteal and anterior tibial arteries. Echocardiography did not indicate any cardiac abnormalities.  Management: Following vascular surgery consultation  endovascular treatment (angioplasty with stenting) was decided upon due to the patient's overall health condition and the severity of CLI. The procedure resulted in restored circulation to the affected limb  with duplex ultrasound confirming improved arterial blood flow. The patient was also started on a dual antiplatelet regimen and high-intensity statin therapy to help prevent further arterial blockages.   Follow-up and outcome: The patient's excruciating pain reduced post-procedure  which he noted the following day of the treatment. Regular wound care was also included in the patient’s management. After six weeks  the ulcer in the right foot showed considerable healing  and his ABPI improved to 0.9. He was advised to continue the medication and adopt a lifestyle involving regular exercise  a balanced diet  and strict glycemic control.  Conclusion: With timely intervention  patients with critical limb ischemia can avoid a possible limb amputation and improve quality of life. It reinforces the importance of regular monitoring and stringent control of comorbidities like diabetes and hyperlipidemia  which are known risk factors for atherosclerosis leading to CLI. 
7,7,81,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial81,Case Report – Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Case Identification:  A 58-year-old African-American male patient was referred to the vascular clinic due to recurring intermittent claudication and non-healing wounds on his left lower extremity. The patient described the pain as severe  exacerbated by walking even short distances  and occasionally occurring at rest. The patient also reported a consistent mild dull ache in the lower extremity when not moving.  Demographic Information:  The subject is an unmarried African-American man  employed as a truck driver  a former smoker and with an occasional alcohol intake. He resides in an urban  metropolitan area in Florida.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a well-documented history of type II diabetes mellitus  which he reports managing with diet and metformin. Hypertension  controlled with lisinopril and amlodipine. There was a 30 pack-year smoking history  though he quit 6 years ago. Patient has hypercholesterolemia  managed with atorvastatin. Furthermore  he experienced a myocardial infarction approximately four years ago  managed with double antiplatelet therapy and beta blockers; since discontinued. No history of peripheral arterial disease or stroke.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed a non-palpable left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulse. The left lower extremity was noticeably cooler than the right. It was observed two non-healing  superficial ulcers on the left foot: one at the tip of the first toe  second at the third metatarsal head. There was no cellulitis or deep infection noticeable. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) showcased severe left lower extremity ischemia with a value of less than 0.40. A duplex ultrasound exposed a significant stenosis in the left lower extremity.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Based on the clinical findings and the patient's reported symptoms  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia was made. Pulse volume recordings showed a significant dampening of the signals in the left lower extremity compared to the right. The patient underwent a contrast angiogram that confirmed the findings from the duplex ultrasound. It exhibited a complete occlusion in the left common iliac artery and severe stenosis in the left external iliac artery. No significant disease was noticed in the right lower extremity.   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was treated initially with maximum medical therapy including antiplatelet  statin  and cilostazol to improve his symptoms. Further  angioplasty was recommended but the patient refused all the invasive strategy interventions.  Follow-up and outcomes:  Following medical therapy  his symptoms became less severe but patient still reports pain during walking. Considering the persistent critical condition  the assessment of amputation of the left lower extremity is under discussion.   Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of early recognition and aggressive management in patients with significant risk factors for atherosclerotic disease. Diagnosis of CLI must be considered in diabetic patients with chronic foot ulcers. It also demonstrates the potential pitfalls when patient hesitates for interventional strategy leading to poorer prognosis. 
7,7,82,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial82,Case Report- Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information:   Mr. Albert  a 68-year-old African-American male  presented with progressive lower extremity pain at rest and non-healing wounds on both feet for the last three weeks.

7,7,84,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial84,Title: Case Report on a Patient with Critical Limb Ischemia   Abstract: This case report provides the details of a 68-year-old male patient diagnosed with critical limb ischemia  and attempts to evaluate the management strategies and outcomes. Senior patients and those with diabetes or peripheral artery disease are typically vulnerable to this severe condition.  Patient Profile: The patient is a retired accountant from a rural area  who has a history of smoking and alcohol use. His past medical history revealed diagnoses of type II diabetes  hypertension  and peripheral artery disease.  Presentation: The patient presented with a 2-month history of severe pain in his right lower leg  notably on ambulation and during night time. The pain was progressively increasing  and the patient also reported symptoms of numbness and coldness in the extremity. Further physical examination revealed a non-healing ulcer (approximately 2cm in diameter) on his right foot along with weak or non-palpable pulses below the knee.  Clinical Findings: Laboratory tests indicated poor glycemic control with elevated HbA1c (8.8%). The patient's LDL cholesterol was slightly elevated (110 mg/dL)  and creatinine levels were normal  ruling out renal impairment. Doppler ultrasound confirmed significant stenosis in the below-knee arteries  and angiography corroborated severe peripheral artery disease with multiple blockages.  Treatment and Outcomes: A multidisciplinary approach was taken for treatment: optimal glycemic control was strived for  and the patient was referred to a dietitian for appropriate dietary recommendations. The patient was prescribed antiplatelet therapy and statins to retard the progression of peripheral artery disease.  Given the severity of the condition and the presence of non-healing ulcers  an endovascular procedure  specifically angioplasty  was performed. The procedure was successful  and follow-up ultrasounds showed improved blood flow in the affected region. The patient's healing progress was closely monitored  and he was advised to quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption.  After 6 weeks  the patient reported a significant reduction in pain and improved mobility. The ulcer showed signs of healing. The patient was continued on lifelong medication for diabetes  hypertension  and cholesterol management.  Conclusion: This case underlines the need for early recognition of critical limb ischemia symptoms in patients with risk factors like diabetes and peripheral artery disease. A multidisciplinary approach with endovascular surgical intervention and lifestyle modifications proves effective in managing the condition. 
7,7,85,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial85,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 73-Year-Old Female with a History of Cardiovascular Disease  Patient Information: A 73-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to our facility on account of severe claudication in her right lower extremity which had been persisting for the past eight months. The patient is a known case of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She also has a medical history of coronary artery disease for which she underwent coronary angioplasty 2 years ago. She is a nonsmoker with no history of alcohol or substance abuse.   Presenting Complaints: The patient presented with chronic non-healing ulcers on her right foot  accompanied by severe pain in the right leg that typically intensifies at rest. Her pain  scored as an 8 out of 10 on the intensity scale  could not be alleviated by hanging her leg over the side of the bed or taking over-the-counter pain relievers. She also reported a significant decrease in mobility due to the pain  limiting her daily activities and negatively affecting her quality of life.   Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed cool skin in her right lower extremity  along with weak arterial pulses  venous filling time of over 20 seconds  and a significant decrease in hair growth. The right foot was pale with some discoloration and had deep non-healing ulcers in the heel and dorsal areas. No signs of inflammation or infection were observed in the affected area. The left leg appeared normal with strong arterial pulses and no signs of ulceration or discomfort.   Diagnostic Assessment: An ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement of 0.45 in the right lower limb and Duplex ultrasound confirmed the presence of severe arterial occlusion. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) later revealed long segment occlusion of the right femoropopliteal artery. Blood tests showed elevated glycated hemoglobin  indicative of poorly controlled diabetes.   Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was administered pain management medications to alleviate her symptoms. The wound was debrided  and negative pressure wound therapy initiated for the ulcers. Considering the patient's age and her high surgical risk status due to her significant cardiovascular history  it was decided to proceed with endovascular revascularization. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed with successful recanalization of the occluded segment.  Follow-up and Outcomes: The patient showed significant improvement post-procedure with a remarkable reduction in her pain scores and a notable improvement in the healing of her ulcers. She was discharged with oral antiplatelets  statin therapy  and a rigorous diabetic control regimen. The patient was also referred for rehabilitation and informed about lifestyle modifications  including a balanced diet and regular exercise.   Conclusion: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe and advanced stage of peripheral arterial disease posing significant patient risk. A comprehensive individualized treatment approach considering the patient's comorbidities is requisite to manage and significantly improve the quality of life for such patients.
7,7,86,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial86,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in a Patient with Poorly Controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Case Report  I. Introduction Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a severe manifestation of peripheral arterial disease and is linked to high morbidity  amputation rates  and mortality. This case report focuses on a patient with CLI  with a history of poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes.  II. Patient Information The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian female (weight: 72 kg  height: 165 cm)  a former smoker with a 30-pack year history  and a resident of Ontario  Canada. She lives with her husband and is retired from a career in education.   III. Clinical Findings The patient presented with severe pain in her right leg  extending from the calf to the foot  much aggravated at rest. There was notable skin discoloration and coldness in the lower extremities  particularly the right leg. Additionally  she reported experiencing rapid weight loss in the past couple of months.   IV. Medical History The patient was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) 20 years ago but struggled with glycemic control due to poor medication and dietary compliance. Her latest HbA1c level was 9.2%. Additionally  she suffered from Hypertension and Dyslipidemia  both controlled with medication. She had a history of coronary artery disease but no myocardial infarction. Furthermore  she had no history of cerebrovascular accidents or known peripheral vascular disease. Her medications included Metformin and Insulin for Diabetes  Ramipril for Hypertension  and Atorvastatin for Dyslipidemia. She had quit smoking five years ago.   V. Diagnostic Assessment On bilateral lower extremity examination  no palpable pulses were noted distally  and Doppler assessment revealed markedly diminished signals in the right distal leg. An Ankle-Brachial Index was 0.5 on the right and 0.6 on the left. CT Angiography revealed severe occlusive atherosclerotic disease in the infrapopliteal vessels on the right side  confirming the diagnosis of CLI.   VI. Therapeutic Intervention and Follow-up The patient was commenced on optimal medical therapy including aspirin and a statin  with optimization of her diabetes control. She was referred for endovascular intervention. However  due to the advanced nature of the disease  distal bypass surgery was performed. Her post-operative course was uneventful  and she showed signs of clinical improvement  with wound healing and diminished pain. She continues to attend follow-up outpatient appointments every three months to monitor her diabetes control and peripheral arterial disease.  VII. Conclusion This case highlights the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of risk factors  particularly in diabetes mellitus  to potentially prevent the development and progression of peripheral arterial disease and CLI.
7,7,87,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial87,Title: A Case of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 62-Year-Old Male End-Stage Renal Disease Patient  Case Description:  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male with a significant medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD)  long-standing Type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and peripheral artery disease (PAD).  The patient first presented to the emergency department with acute onset severe rest pain in his left lower limb. The pain was constant and associated with a non-healing ulcer on the left great toe. He reported worsening of the pain during the night and had to dangle his leg over the side of the bed to ease it (orthopnea). He denied any trauma or history of similar symptoms in the past. On further inquiry  the patient disclosed intermittent claudication for the past year  which he overlooked and associated with his age and general health status.  Physical examination revealed a pale and cold left lower extremity. The posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were absent bilaterally. Findings were consistent with a Rutherford category IV critical limb ischemia (CLI) on the left side. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.30 on the left side and 0.65 on the right  confirming severe PAD.  Given these findings and the patients' history of ESRD and diabetes  an urgent peripheral angiography was performed  which demonstrated a complete occlusion of the left superficial femoral artery  popliteal artery  and the proximal part of the anterior tibial artery. The patient was immediately subjected to a femoral-popliteal bypass surgery using a synthetic graft.  Post-surgery  the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring of his hemodynamic status and renal function. Rehabilitation measures were initiated and the patient was prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy  statin  and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Strict blood glucose control was advised to prevent infection of the pre-existing ulcer and progression of CLI.  Within the subsequent weeks  the patient demonstrated considerable improvement. Physical examination showed palpable dorsal pedis and posterior tibial pulses  while his rest pain and ulcer showed signs of improvement.  Discussion:  This case highlights the severe consequences of untreated PAD  eventually leading to CLI. Management requires a comprehensive approach including medical therapy  lifestyle modification  and invasive procedures like angiography and bypass surgery in extensive blockages.  Increased awareness about early signs of PAD among high-risk patients  such as those with diabetes and renal disease  is crucial to prevent severe complications like CLI. Regular ABI checks can serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool to monitor these patients.
7,7,88,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial88,Patient Profile:  Mr. James Smith  a 72-year-old African-American male  presented himself in the emergency department of our hospital. The patient's primary complaint was unbearable pain in his right leg that worsened during the night  making it extremely challenging for him to sleep. He also mentioned intermittent claudication  noting that the pain became severe during walking but reduced when he was at rest. Upon physical examination  the skin of his right foot was presenting non-healing ulcers and was cold to touch. No pedal pulsations were felt. The patient's medical history revealed a diagnosis of Type II diabetes mellitus under control with oral hypoglycemic and hypertension managed with ACE inhibitors and diuretics medications.  Medical History:   Mr. Smith has had a history of atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease (PAD) for the last six years  for which he undergoes regular medical follow-ups. Besides  he has been under continuous monitoring and medication for hypertension for ten years and type II diabetes for fifteen years. The patient also has a ten-year history of hyperlipidemia managed with statins and a smoking habit of twenty years  although he quit smoking about eight years ago.  Investigations:  An immediate ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) was calculated  which indicated 0.32 in the right leg and 0.98 in the left leg. These results affirmed the presence of severe ischemia in the right limb. Further  Doppler ultrasonography of the right lower limb manifested severe stenosis of the distal right femoral artery and total occlusion of popliteal and trifurcation arteries. No significant stenosis was detected in the left leg.  Treatment:  Given the severity of the ischemia  critical limb ischemia (CLI) was diagnosed  and an urgent peripheral angioplasty with a potential stent placement procedure was recommended to re-establish blood flow to his right leg. The patient was counseled about the need for the procedure  the risks involved  and the potential outcomes if left untreated. He verbalized understanding and consented to proceed.  Outcome and Follow-up:  The angioplasty and stent placement were successful  with immediate relief reported in his leg pain. Subsequent ABPI evaluation showed significant improvement  and pedal pulses became palpable. The patient was prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy and advised to continue his medications for diabetes and hypertension. He was also advised for regular exercise  a proper diabetes diet  and to monitor blood sugar levels more frequently. He was scheduled for a one-month follow-up consultation to monitor his condition and healing progression of the foot ulcers.  This case reveals the profound impact of long-term diabetes and hypertension on vascular health  leading to critical conditions like limb ischemia. Thus  it strongly points out the importance of regular screening and early intervention for PAD in high-risk individuals  particularly diabetics.
7,7,89,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial89,Title: An Uncommon Presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Diabetic Patient  Patient Profile: The patient is an 82-year-old Caucasian male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus well controlled on insulin. He is a former smoker  with a 30-pack year history and quit smoking 20 years ago. The patient is also known to have hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he’s maintained on medication (amlodipine and atorvastatin  respectively). He denied any history of cardiovascular diseases or peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Presenting complaints: The patient presented to the hospital outpatient department complaining of non-healing ulcers on his right lower extremity for approximately three months. He also mentioned associated symptoms like intermittent claudication  coldness  and pallor in the same limb. No history of trauma was reported.  Clinical Findings: On inspection  the patient had gangrenous changes and ulcers in his distal right foot. Peripheral pulses  including dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial  were absent in the right lower limb but easily palpable in the left lower limb.   Laboratory Investigations: His Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was slightly elevated at 7.2%  indicating poor glycemic control. Lipid panel showed elevated cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels. Complete blood count  blood urea nitrogen  and creatinine were within normal limits.   Imaging and Diagnostic Assessment: On performing an ankle-brachial index (ABI)  values were lower than 0.40 in the right lower limb indicative of critical ischemia. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the lower limbs demonstrated severe occlusive disease in the patient's right lower limb vessels  particularly involving the below-knee popliteal artery and tibial arteries.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical findings  ABI value  CTA imaging  and the chronic presence of gangrenous foot ulcers  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) was made.  Treatment: The patient underwent lower limb revascularization via angioplasty. Post-procedure  his symptoms started to improve  and the ulcers began to show signs of healing. In addition  he was initiated on antiplatelets  statins  and optimal wound care was given for his foot ulcers.  Follow-up: Given his advanced age  diabetes  and other comorbidities  a multidisciplinary team  including endocrinologists  nutritionists  and physiotherapists  formed a comprehensive care plan. The patient was advised stringent diabetes control  a balanced diet and regular follow-ups.  Conclusion: This case depicts a rather uncommon presentation of CLI in the absence of a known history of peripheral artery disease (PAD). It underscores the propensity of certain risk factors  such as diabetes and smoking  towards PAD and ultimately CLI. Early detection and appropriate treatment can mitigate the risk of major amputation and improve the quality of life in these patients.
7,7,90,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial90,Title: Case Report on an Older Adult Male with Critical Limb Ischemia Due to Chronic Peripheral Arterial Disease   Case Introduction: The patient is an 82-year-old Caucasian male who presented with chronic non-healing ulcers in the right lower extremity for the past 6 months. The patient has a history of progressive  exertional right leg pain over the last year which has significantly worsened over the past two months causing him discomfort during short-distance walks and at rest at night. The patient’s past medical history includes hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus  hypercholesterolemia  and a 60-pack year smoking history. The patient has been a non-smoker for the past five years.  Clinical findings: Upon admission  the patient appeared uncomfortable and reported severe pain in his right leg rated at 8 on a 10-point scale. Physical examination revealed a pale  cool right lower extremity with weak pedal pulses. Multiple non-healing ulcers were noted on the forefoot and the heel  with signs of local infection. No palpable popliteal or femoral pulses were noted in the right lower limb. Bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) testing came back positive  indicative of osteomyelitis.  Paraclinical Investigations: Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) reading was 0.40 on the right leg and 1.0 on the unaffected left leg  diagnostic of severe peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the right lower limb. Color Doppler Ultrasound (CDUS) of the right lower limb revealed significant arterial stenosis. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) indicated extensive atherosclerotic occlusive disease from the right superficial femoral artery to the tibial arteries. Hemoglobin levels were within normal range  while C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated  consistent with an ongoing inflammatory reaction.  Therapeutic Intervention: Endovascular revascularization was deemed the best approach for this patient  given his overall status. The patient underwent successful right lower limb angioplasty with stent placement in the stenotic segments. Post-procedure  the patient was started on antiplatelet therapy and statin. Intravenous antibiotics were administered for the management of osteomyelitis.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  There was significant improvement in the patient’s pain within the first 48 hours post-procedure. Control ABI after three weeks showed an improved reading of 0.9 on the right leg. Following 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy  the patient showed signs of ulcer healing and a decrease in infection markers.    Patient Perspective: The patient was relieved to find a significant reduction in pain and was willing to comply with the prescribed medication regimen and lifestyle modifications.  Take-Away: Early detection and interventions of PAD are crucial in preventing critical limb ischemia and subsequent complications. This report emphasizes the role of endovascular interventions in managing peripheral arterial disease effectively  preventing amputation  and improving the quality of life of patients. 
7,7,91,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial91,Title: A Case Report of Critical Limb Ischemia in a 76-year-old Caucasian Male with History of Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Introduction:  The patient  referred to as Mr. X for privacy reasons  is a 76-year-old Caucasian male. He resides in the urban outskirts of New York City and is a retired automobile mechanic. He presented with complaints of severe pain in his right lower limb  which he described as a consistent sharp and toothache-like pain. The pain had been escalating over the past few months  but it increased dramatically in the last week with an onset of unusual paleness and coolness of the limb. The patient reported that the pain was so severe it often disturbed his sleep.   Medical History:  Mr. X has a known history of hypertension  which was diagnosed twelve years ago  and type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed ten years ago. He was compliant with his antihypertensive and hypoglycemic medications. However  his blood pressure control and blood glucose levels had been poorly controlled in recent years.  The patient has moderate renal impairment as revealed by his latest blood tests. He was also previously diagnosed with peripheral artery disease about two years ago. He was a heavy smoker until his diagnosis  after which he quit smoking.  Symptoms and Diagnosis:  On physical examination  there were notable signs of ischemia: the skin of the right lower limb was pale  cool to touch  and shiny with notable absence of hair. Pulses in the right posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries were absent. A Doppler ultrasound confirmed impaired blood flow to the right lower limb.  The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.6 in the right limb and normal in the left limb (1.2)  which is suggestive of significant artery blockage. This  coupled with his history and the characteristic features on examination  confirmed the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia in the right lower limb.  Conclusion:  Critical limb ischemia in patients with co-morbid conditions like hypertension and type 2 diabetes requires careful management and aggressive intervention to prevent limb loss. The case of Mr. X presents an instance of poor control of these co-morbid conditions leading to the advanced symptomatology. This case indicates the necessity of controlled medical management of these conditions and close monitoring of patients with a similar profile for early identification and management of critical limb ischemia. With collaboration between the patient  his family physician and a multi-disciplinary team  it is hoped that Mr. X will achieve a beneficial outcome  allowing a return to normal daily living activities. Future studies should seek to establish clear protocols for early detection and management of critical limb ischemia in similar patients. 
7,7,92,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial92,Patient Information:  AN  a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a medical history of Diabetes Type 2  Hypertension  Hypercholesterolemia  and past smoker (quit 15 years ago)  initially presented to the clinic with symptoms of significant pain in his right lower extremity (RLE)  even at rest. He mentioned that he had been experiencing prolonged  severe pain and numbness in that leg over the last few weeks  noticing a change of color to a bluish/purplish hue. The patient also reported difficulty walking due to the pain (claudication).  Past Medical History:  The patient has been diagnosed and managed for Type 2 Diabetes for the last ten years  with fair glycemic control (latest HbA1c-7.5%). He is on metformin  insulin glargine  and sitagliptin for his diabetes. He also has Hypertension for which he takes lisinopril and amlodipine  and he follows a strict dietary regimen to keep the numbers under check. He was diagnosed with Hypercholesterolemia three years ago  for which he takes atorvastatin. He has been a smoker in the past (40 pack-years history)  but he quit smoking 15 years prior.  Presenting Complaints:  He complains of rest pain for the last one month and a non-healing ulcer over plantar aspect of the right foot. Around 3 weeks ago  he noticed a small red wound on the bottom of his right foot which now has grown bigger and deeper despite regular cleaning and dressing.  Physical Examination:  On examination  his right foot was cold to touch with barely audible posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery's pulse. Distal leg and foot showed a leathery discoloration with well-defined ulcer over the plantar area of the foot. Distal pulses in his left leg were palpable.  Assessment / Diagnostic Evaluation:  The symptoms were suggestive of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Confirmatory tests were done which included Ankle-Brachial Index (0.3 in right leg  0.9 in left leg). Doppler ultrasound showed significantly reduced blood flow in the right distal leg. CT angiography showed severe stenosis in the distal part of the right superficial femoral artery and complete blockage at the level of popliteal artery. An EKG and echocardiogram were performed to the role out Ischemic heart disease before intervention and were normal.  Treatment and Follow-up:  The patient was started on pain management  antiplatelet (clopidogrel)  and statin therapy (increased dose). Revascularization was planned with an attempt made for below-knee angioplasty. Unfortunately  due to extensive arterial disease  the procedure was unsuccessful. He was then referred for bypass surgery. The patient underwent successful bypass surgery  and his postoperative course was uneventful.   During the follow-up visits  his symptoms significantly improved  the ulcer was healing  and the color of the limb returned to normal. He was advised to maintain strict glycemic and blood pressure control. He was asked to follow up regularly with a multidisciplinary team  including the vascular surgery  diabetology  and podiatry departments.  Learning Points:  This case reiterated the importance of timely intervention in cases of critical limb ischemia  especially amongst patients with risk factors such as Diabetes  Hypertension  Dyslipidemia  and smoking history. In hindsight  proactive peripheral vascular disease screening may have helped due to the patient's significant risk profile. Also  a better adherence to diabetes and hypertension control could possibly have delayed or prevented this complication.
7,7,93,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial93,Title: Severe Critical Limb Ischemia in a 65-year-old Male with History of Peripheral Artery Disease: A Case Report  Introduction: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries which seriously reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and even skin ulcers or sores. CLI is the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  Patient Information: The subject of this report is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department with severe rest pain in the left foot  which had been worsening over the past two weeks. Accompanying this pain was the development of a non-healing ulcer on the heel of the same foot. The patient was a long-term smoker (40 years  2 packs/day) and had a medical history of type 2 diabetes and peripheral artery disease. He lived a sedentary lifestyle and was regularly wheelchair-bound due to his chronic conditions.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a palpable but weak dorsalis pedis pulse. The left foot was pale  cold to touch  and showed signs of livedo reticularis. Distal pulses were absent. The non-healing ulcer was approximately 3cm in diameter with black eschar on the surface. There were no signs of infection around the ulcer  but the severity of the ischemia suggested a high risk.  Diagnostic Assessment: Laboratory investigations revealed elevated serum creatinine levels  consistent with renal insufficiency. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was found to be less than 0.4  indicating severe PAD. A duplex ultrasound scan and computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed occlusion of the left distal superficial femoral & popliteal arteries  along with the anterior tibial artery.  Therapeutic Intervention: Upon diagnosis  the patient was started on a regimen of antiplatelet and statin therapy. Subsequently  endovascular revascularization was attempted via percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) along with drug-eluting stent placement. The procedure was successful with restoration of tri-phasic flow.  Follow Up and Outcomes: Postoperative checkups over a period of three months revealed continued blood flow in previously occluded vessels. The pain experienced by the patient significantly reduced  ulcer signs of healing were clear and renal function tests returned to normal.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed immense relief post-procedure with alleviation of the rest pain and improved mobility. He was optimistic about maintaining the lifestyle improvements suggested by his healthcare professionals.  Conclusion: This case report highlights the necessity of early diagnosis and intervention in management of critical limb ischemia to prevent limb loss. It underscores the need for aggressive treatment in patients with severe PAD to avoid progression to CLI. Moreover  the role of patient education in the management of risk factors for PAD  such as smoking and diabetes  should be stressed to prevent the occurrence of CLI.

He is a former smoker and quit around 10 years ago. There is no history of illicit drug use or alcoholism. The patient has been living a sedentary lifestyle and has persistent issues with weight gain and obesity leading to other associated health problems.   Presenting Concerns: Mr. John presented with a complaint of severe pain in his left lower limb that had been present for several months. He has been experiencing rest pain primarily in his foot that worsens at night  with numbness and occasional tingling. He has noticed a marked decrease in walking distance due to pain and described the initiation of skin color changes and coldness in his left foot. He mentioned the formation of small wounds on the foot that were slow to heal and often became infected.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination confirmed non-healing wounds on his left foot. His left foot was cold to touch with weak pedal pulses  and it showed signs of early gangrene at the toes. His body mass index (BMI) calculated was 35  indicating Class II obesity. His blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg. Laboratory studies showed a raise in fasting blood glucose level  a moderately elevated total cholesterol and LDL level  and normal kidney function tests.  Diagnostic Assessment: Based on the clinical presentation and physical examination findings  a preliminary diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) was made. This was confirmed by performing Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) that showed a value of 0.3  suggestive of severe peripheral artery disease. A Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremity was performed which illustrated impaired blood flow in the left lower extremity primarily involving the tibial and peroneal arteries.  Treatment & Outcomes: Considering the diagnosis of CLI  an immediate vascular surgical consult was made. The patient underwent successful revascularization with angioplasty and stenting of the diseased blood vessels  followed by optimization of his antiplatelet  antihypertensive  and diabetes medications. He was also provided with extensive wound care for his foot ulcers. Nutritional consultations and physiotherapy sessions were also initiated as part of the management plan.  In addition  lifestyle modification counseling was provided  emphasizing the importance of regular exercise  healthy diet  and weight control. For stronger secondary prevention  the patient was closely monitored with regular follow-up visits to evaluate the limb's progression and his overall well-being.  Teaching Points: CLI is a severe form of peripheral arterial disease and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Timely diagnosis through careful clinical appraisal and pertinent investigations is essential. Early revascularization  optimal control of comorbid conditions  and lifestyle modifications form a crucial part of managing such cases for better patient outcomes.
7,7,95,diagnosis7-prompt7-trial95,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia in a 68-Year-Old Male   Patient Background:  Mr. John Doe is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  residing in rural Idaho. His presenting complaint is severe pain in the right lower extremity characterized by rest pain at the calf  foot  and toes. The pain is described as a constant burning sensation that is 9/10 in severity and aggravated at night. Mr. Doe also disclosed progressive discoloration of the right foot from a healthy pink to a pallor gray along with a non-healing ulcer on the right big toe.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a significant past medical history. He has been a type 2 diabetic for roughly 15 years  which is semi-controlled on Metformin. His systolic blood pressure was recorded as high as 190 mmHg on a few occasions earlier in the year. Thus  he has been diagnosed with hypertension that has been somewhat resistant to treatment. His hypertension is currently managed with a daily dose of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide.  Additionally  he has been a smoker for approximately 50 years. His quit attempts have been unsuccessful despite utilizing nicotine replacement therapy. Mr. Doe also has a history of hyperlipidemia controlled with Atorvastatin.  Family History:  He has a family history of heart disease; his father passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 63 and his older brother had coronary artery bypass grafting surgery five years ago.   Clinical Assessment:  Given his clinical presentation and past medical history  a preliminary diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was suspected. The attending physician noticed pronounced limb pallor  decreased movement and sensation  cold extremities  and weak pulse intensity in the right lower limb. The non-healing ulcer on his big toe also indicated chronic insufficient blood flow.  Doppler ultrasound  angiography  and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) were ordered  and findings indeed confirmed severe peripheral artery disease (PAD)  consistent with CLI.   Treatment and Progress:  Mr. Doe was started on a program of revascularization therapy to restore appropriate blood flow and nutrients to his right lower extremity. He was also prescribed antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy for blood thinning and clot prevention and statins to keep his cholesterol levels under better control.  He was referred to a dietician to help manage his diabetes and obesity  provided counseling for smoking cessation  and offered wound care for his non-healing ulcer. He will be regularly followed-up with in the vascular clinic for management of his condition.  In conclusion  this case sheds light on the crucial importance of recognizing the signs and risks of critical limb ischemia in patients with diabetes  atherosclerosis  and a history of tobacco use. Proper management of these risk factors can reduce the severity or prevent CLI and its complications.

The patient lives in the inner city  is married  and works as a delivery truck driver. He drinks alcohol on occasions and denies illicit drug use. He claims compliance with blood pressure and cholesterol medications.  Medical History  The patient has a documented past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  type 2 diabetes mellitus poorly controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents  and a 40 pack-year history of smoking cigarettes. He has no known allergies  no genetic syndromes  no documented psychiatric issues  and no history of surgeries or major trauma.  Chief Complaint  Mr. B primarily complained of continual rest pain in the left lower limb  especially severe during the night time  disturbing his sleep for the past 4 weeks. He also reported an open wound on the side of his left foot  which had not healed in a month. Upon inspection  the wound appeared necrotic and was approximately 2 cm in diameter  with minor pus discharge surrounding the region.  Clinical Findings  During the physical examination  the patient's left lower limb was significantly cooler than the right  and diminished pulses were noted. His left foot showed ischemic changes with hair loss  pallor  and thickened toenails. An ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) measurement was taken and showed considerably lower values for the affected left limb (0.40)  suggestive of arterial insufficiency.  Diagnostic Assessment  Given the patient’s risk factors and clinical presentation  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) was considered. Further diagnostic workup with peripheral angiography and duplex ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis showing severely reduced arterial flow in the left lower limb. Blood tests were also conducted revealing poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c: 9.2%) and dyslipidemia.  Therapeutic Intervention  Prompt revascularization was recommended due to the presence of rest pain and necrotic wound  indicative of imminent risk of limb loss. He underwent an angioplasty and stent placement of the stenotic segments in left iliac and femoral arteries. Medication regimen was enhanced by initiating clopidogrel  a P2Y12 inhibitor for prevention of post-angioplasty thrombotic events  and optimizing his glycemic control.  Follow-up and Outcomes  During follow-up after revascularization  the patient’s rest pain markedly improved  and healing of the foot ulcer initiated. Better glycemic control was achieved over time. Overall  Mr. B showed satisfactory progress and is followed up regularly in the vascular surgery clinic.     Conclusion  This case highlights the significance of early recognition and intervention in patients with critical limb ischemia  particularly in patients with considerable risk factors such as poorly controlled diabetes  dyslipidemia  and a significant history of smoking.

There is no family history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).   Physical Examination: Upon examination  the patient had absent pulses in the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis on the left leg. A small  superficial ulcer was seen on the dorsal portion of the left foot. Furthermore  he had a weak monophasic pulse on the right leg. There was noticeable pallor in the left leg  especially on leg elevation.   Diagnostic Assessment: An ankle-brachial index (ABI) was performed that revealed a score of 0.40  indicative of severe PAD. Afterward  the patient underwent a Doppler ultrasound  which detected significant stenosis in the left iliac and femoral arteries.   Treatment Plan: The patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He was referred to the vascular surgery department and underwent successful iliac and femoral artery revascularization. Also  he was advised to stop smoking and manage his diabetes more effectively. He was started on antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel)  statin therapy (atorvastatin)  and the ACE inhibitor (ramipril) was added to his treatment regimen to control hypertension.  Progress and Follow up: The patient showed significant improvement in leg pain and healing of the foot ulcer post-surgery. Follow-up ABI showed an improved score of 0.85. The patient was scheduled for regular check-ups to monitor his condition.  This case highlights the importance of considering CLI in patients with significant risk factors  such as long-term smoking  diabetes  and hypertension. It emphasizes the need for vigilant monitoring  and early recognition as CLI can lead to serious consequences if untreated.  Patient Consent: Obtained.

7,9,1,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial1,Presentation:  A 72-year-old Hispanic male presented to the emergency department with acute onset of right lower limb pain that had commenced about 24 hours prior. The pain was severe and persistent  accompanied by a cold sensation and significant color change in the limb.  Past Medical History: The patient has a medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for the past 20 years and a 40-pack year smoking history. He also suffers from hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Two months ago  a toe on his right foot was amputated due to a non-healing infection.   Demographics: He lives with his wife in a suburban area and retired as a truck driver. He is a heavy smoker and has been smoking for more than 50 years. He also reports occasional alcohol consumption.  Family History: His father died of myocardial infarction  and his elder brother had a stroke. Both his brother and mother have type 2 diabetes.   Physical Exam: Upon examination  the patient's right foot was pale and colder compared to the left foot. There were changes in skin color and decreased hair growth. Distal pulses were absent with reduced capillary refill time. There were no audible bruits over the femoral or popliteal arteries.   Investigations and Diagnosis: An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was conducted  which resulted in a reading of 0.3 on the right side  suggestive of severe PAD. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) revealed severe stenosis of the right popliteal artery and the trifurcation arteries. Based on the clinical findings and investigations  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made.  Management: Post-diagnosis  patient management included urgent revascularization of the right leg  adjustments to control his diabetes  a strict cessation of smoking  and lifestyle modification advice. He was referred to a vascular surgeon for consideration of a possible bypass or endovascular procedure. Also  he was referred to a dietitian and a diabetes educator to assist with control of his diabetes.  This case demonstrates how PAD can lead to CLI if left untreated in patients with uncontrolled diabetes and long-term smoking habits. Early detection and aggressive management of PAD may prevent the development of CLI and its grievous consequences.
7,9,2,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial2,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 70-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Webber. He presented with a chief complaint of worsening chronic pain in his left lower limb  particularly the foot  which exacerbated during the night or when he was lying flat. Additionally  he reported numbness  pallor  and coolness in his limb. He has a history of ulcers in his left foot which failed to heal due to poor blood circulation. He also mentioned experiencing difficulty in walking long distances and climbing stairs due to muscle cramping in the leg  a condition known as claudication.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Webber has a significant history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past 15 years.

7,9,6,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial6,"Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: Mrs. Mildred Jones is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who recently arrived our Emergency Department  presenting with significant pain in her lower left leg. She's a retired school teacher and lives alone  despite having her two grown children and grandchildren living nearby.  Presenting Problem: Mrs. Jones complained of severe persistent pain in her left lower limb (rest pain)  especially profound at night  coupled with non-healing sores on her left foot. She also reports experiencing difficulty walking for the last several months due to discomfort and fatigue in her leg. These are classic symptoms of critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history reveals a long-standing relationship with tobacco  described as a """"pack-a-day"""" smoker for nearly four decades  until she successfully quit five years ago. She has history of uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes and was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure. She also suffered a myocardial infarction four years ago. All these conditions indicate a high risk for peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  Family History: Mrs. Jones’ family history reveals both her parents died of heart complications. Her father passed away from a heart attack at 66 years  while her mother had congestive heart failure at 78 years. Her elder brother is currently managing his cholesterol and blood pressure.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  there was marked pallor of the left foot with an absent posterior tibial pulse. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured at 0.4  indicating severe PAD. An angiogram revealed significant multi-level arterial occlusive disease of the left lower extremity  pointing towards CLI.  Treatment Plan: We plan to commence Mrs. Jones on analgesics for pain management and antibiotics for her non-healing foot ulcers. After comprehensive consultation with the Vascular team  she was deemed suitable for revascularization. This could preserving the limb  improve her functional status  and overall quality of life. Control of secondary risk factors will be intensified with antiplatelets  antihypertensives and statins. She will also need to maintain her strict diet control (considering her diabetes) as well as maintain complete abstinence from smoking. It will be essential to involve her in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme to effectively manage her condition.  Upon discharge  Mrs. Jones will be referred to the outpatient limb preservation clinic for further management. Close monitoring will be fundamental to ensure wound healing  control infection  and most importantly  prevent amputation.    Prognosis: The prognosis of CLI is very serious with a high mortality rate and increased risk of non-fatal cardiovascular ischemic events. This case makes one aware of the significant potential morbidity among patients presenting with CLI and the need for improved strategies to manage atherosclerotic risk factors in these patients. The close collaboration between primary care and various specialties will definitely provide an integral role to provide optimal care for patients with CLI."

7,9,14,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial14,Case Presentation:  Patient Information: A 65-year-old African-American male with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia presents with complaints of severe pain in his left lower extremity. Patient reports additional symptoms of intermittent claudication  particularly during exercise  with some relief upon resting and sores that won't heal on the toes of his left foot. He is a retired truck driver  physically inactive  lifelong smoker  has a high-fat diet  and is obese with body mass index of 32 kg/m2.   Family History:  There is a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases; both his father and grandfather died of a myocardial infarction. His mother had type 2 diabetes and his maternal aunt has peripheral artery disease.  History of Present Illness:  The patient's intermittent claudication has exacerbated over the last six months  now causing him significant discomfort even at rest. He also reported non-healing ulcers on his left foot which persisted for three months now  raising suspicion of critical limb ischemia. He has been on medication for diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia with medication adherence confirmed.  Physical Findings:  Examination reveals pallor and coolness of his left foot  diminished dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses  and atrophic skin changes. Moreover  painful necrotic ulcers measuring about 2x2 cm are visible on his left toes. The right foot appeared normal.  Assessment & Plan:  The severity of the patient’s symptomatology  along with the physical exam findings and risk factors  suggests a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) secondary to peripheral artery disease. Doppler ultrasound  an ankle-brachial index  CT angiography  and possibly angiography should be conducted to confirm the diagnosis  evaluate the extent of vascular occlusion and plan for the best possible treatment approach.  Given his risk factors and condition  a multidisciplinary approach to care will be appropriate. This includes cessation of smoking  dietary changes  glucose and BP control  exercise  along with pharmacotherapy for CLI. In case of non responsiveness to the conservative treatment or in severe blockage  endovascular procedures or bypass surgery may be required.   This patient's case highlights the importance of regular monitoring and timely management of chronic diseases such as diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia to prevent debilitating complications like CLI.
7,9,15,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial15,Patient Information:   Name: Mr. Smith  Age: 70   Gender: Male  Race: African American  Occupation: Retired school teacher  Medical History:  Mr. Smith has been suffering from uncontrolled Type II diabetes mellitus for the past twenty years. His other significant medical history involves hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are poorly controlled due to medication non-adherence. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year smoking history  who stopped smoking about ten years ago.  Family History:  His father died of a stroke at the age of 72 and his mother died of a heart attack at 76. His eldest brother suffered from peripheral arterial disease and underwent an amputation at the age of 68.  Presenting Complaint:  Complains of chronic pain in his right lower leg that has significantly exacerbated over the past month  interrupting his sleep patterns. He also reported non-healing ulcers on the right foot and decreased mobility due to pain and weakness. He explained the pain as worsening when his leg is elevated and decreasing when it remains in the dependent position.  Examination:  On examination  the right lower limb was cooler to touch as compared to left. Pedal pulses were absent in the right foot. There were two ulcers with formed eschars on the right foot- one on the dorsum and the other on the great toe.  Investigation:  An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed  resulting in a low ABI index (<0.4) suggestive of severe arterial disease.   Diagnosis:  Considering the history  clinical examination  and ABI results  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia was made.  Discussion:  Critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe form of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  causes significant morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include smoking  diabetes  obesity  high blood pressure  and family history of heart disease. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent limb loss. For Mr. Smith  it requires aggressive intervention to restore blood flow  control of modifiable risk factors  and wound care to prevent infections. Intervention might involve angioplasty  stent  or bypass surgery. Additionally  further attention to his existing diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension is needed.  Mr. Smith's case presents a challenging scenario where patient education about medication adherence and lifestyle modifications should be paired with aggressive medical and possible surgical intervention  to enhance both the quality and length of life.

Clinical Findings: Examination revealed a pale left foot with cold peripheries  weak pedal pulses  and several non-healing ulcers most prominently at the tips of the left toes. There were signs of hair loss on the lower part of the foot and the skin appeared shiny. A dry gangrene was noted on the left great toe  pointing towards severe ischemia.   Investigations: Laboratory tests showed elevated glucose and HbA1c levels  confirming poorly controlled diabetes. An Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) was performed which showed a lower than normal index  indicative of blockage. A Doppler ultrasound demonstrated a significant decrease in blood flow indicating severe stenosis in the left posterior tibial and peroneal arteries.   Diagnosis: Based on the clinical findings and investigations  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) was made.  Treatment Plan: Mr. Rodriquez was educated about the severity of his condition and the necessity of immediate treatment. An urgent surgical consult for peripheral angioplasty and possible stenting or bypass graft surgery was scheduled. Conservative management was initiated alongside  including aggressive pain control  wound care for the ulcerations  strict glycemic control  and initiation of antiplatelets. Advice was given to quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption. Monthly follow-ups are planned to monitor clinical progress and assess the need for amputation if revascularization surgery isn't successful.   The prognosis of Mr. Rodriguez's condition is uncertain due to delayed presentation and has been explained to him. To ensure optimal care  the patient needs to follow a multi-disciplinary approach including a vascular surgeon  diabetologist  and wound care specialist on board.
7,9,17,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial17,Patient's Case History:  Patient's Profile:   - Age: 72 years old - Sex: Male - Occupation: Retired Military Personnel  - Racial/Ethnic Group: Caucasian  - Marital Status: Married - Children: 3   Presenting Issue:  The patient came to our medical facility with symptoms of severe pain in his right lower limb  even at rest  coupled with non-healing wounds on the leg and foot. After thorough assessment and diagnostic tests  he was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes for the past 15 years and uncontrolled hypertension for over a decade. Furthermore  he has a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosed three years ago. He also has dyslipidemia and was a heavy smoker  having quit about 5 years ago. He had a minor stroke 2 years ago with full recovery.  Family History:  There is a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes; both parents suffered from coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus. His older sibling died of a myocardial infarction.   Clinical Course:  On physical examination  the right lower extremity was found to be cold with diminished pulses and a large  necrotic wound on the foot. The patient complained of insomnia due to the severity of the resting pain. Initial diagnostic studies included Doppler ultrasound and ankle-brachial index (ABI)  which showed significant arterial blockages.  Treatment Plan:  The patient has been suggested to undergo revascularization to restore blood flow. A vascular surgeon is being consulted to determine whether angioplasty or bypass surgery is the best course of action. Meanwhile  the patient is being managed with analgesics for the pain  and aggressive wound care to prevent infection. Adequate blood glucose control and blood pressure management are also crucial in this scenario.  Discussion:  Critical Limb Ischemia is a severe form of PAD  a disease characterized by narrowing or blocking of arteries providing blood to the legs. This patient’s longstanding history of diabetes  hypertension and smoking  coupled with strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  places him at high risk for CLI and requires close monitoring and management. Prompt revascularization can help save his limb and significantly improve his quality of life. Long term management would focus on mitigating risks factors  including secondary prevention therapies. These include antiplatelet  lipid-lowering agents  medication for diabetes and hypertension  lifestyle changes such as diet modification and exercise.   Follow Up:  Follow-up appointments will be made to monitor the patient’s progression  manage pain  and coordinate wound care. It will be crucial to monitor any changes in symptoms such as increased pain  new wounds  or infection signs. Multi-disciplinary care involving cardiology  internal medicine  vascular surgery and wound care specialists will be essential in managing this patient.
7,9,18,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial18,Patient Profile: Patient is a 67-year-old African American male who has been admitted to the hospital for three days due to intermittent claudication.  Present Illness: Over the last six months  the patient has expressed increasing discomfort in his right lower leg while walking short distances. He indicates that rest seems to alleviate the pain  but the time to onset and severity of pain have been progressively worsening. For the past few weeks  the patient has also been dealing with non-healing sores on his right foot. In the last week  his leg started hurting even when he was at rest  particularly at night.  Past Medical History: Notable medical history includes type 2 diabetes present for 20 years and hypertension in control with medication (Amlodipine). He's also been diagnosed with stage 2 chronic kidney disease two years ago. The patient has also been a smoker for the past 35 years and consumes alcohol socially.  Physical Findings: Physical examination showed a pallor foot with no palpable pulses distal to the right popliteal artery. Right foot revealed two ulcers at the tip of the great toe and base of the first toe. Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was 0.4 in the right leg. A Doppler ultrasound showed severe stenosis in the right superficial femoral artery and tibial arteries occluded with compensatory collaterals.  Family History: The patient's father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 62  suggesting a history of cardiovascular diseases in the family. The patient’s mother has type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) of the right leg based on his symptoms  ABI value  and ultrasound findings.  Management Plan: The immediate plan is to start on a regimen of analgesics to control pain and antibiotics for the foot ulcers. High-dose statin therapy is also planned for the patient in line with his diabetes management and CLI. The patient is referred to a vascular surgeon for the possibility of revascularization procedures. He was also advised to quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption  as these lifestyle habits can further accelerate the progression of CLI. Furthermore  he was referred to a dietician and diabetic educator to help better control his blood glucose levels.  Long-term follow-up and intensive control of his diabetes and hypertension are also emphasized. It has been explained to the patient that if left untreated  CLI may progress to the point of requiring amputation of the affected limb. Regular follow-ups were scheduled to monitor the progress of his condition.
7,9,19,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial19,Patient Information:  The patient is a 69-year-old African-American male named John who resides in Springfield  Iowa with his wife. He is a former truck driver who retired five years ago. He is a non-smoker and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. His known medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus which he has been managing for the past 10 years with medication though with poor glycemic control (HbA1c 9.0%); he also suffers from hypertension and hyperlipidemia. There’s no known drug allergy. His father had a myocardial infarction at age 75 and his maternal uncle had a stroke at age 70.  Presenting Complaint:  John presented at the outpatient clinic with a three-month history of progressive pain in his left leg  initially occurring during walking but now even at rest. The pain is severe enough to have disrupted his sleep for the last three weeks. He describes an intense  burning sensation below his left knee that spreads to his foot. He has also noticed a non-healing wound on his left foot.  Clinical Findings:  On clinical examination  pulses in the left lower limb were weakly felt  the foot was pale  cooler to touch compared to the right foot  and there was a decrease in hair distribution. A non-healing ulcer with necrotic tissue of about 2 cm diameter was noted on the dorsal aspect of the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint of left foot. Capillary refill time was significantly prolonged on the left foot and there was decreased sensation to pin-prick and light touch.   Diagnosis:  Given the patient's history of uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and the presenting complaint of rest pain coupled with characteristic clinical findings  a diagnosis of Left Lower Limb Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made.  Treatment and Progress:  An Ankle-Brachial index (ABI) was performed which was consistent with severe peripheral arterial disease. John was duly scheduled for a below-knee angiogram which later revealed severe multi-level lower extremity arterial occlusive disease thus confirming the diagnosis. He thereafter underwent successful endovascular revascularization with balloon angioplasty. He was also counseled on improved control of his diabetes and prescribed antiplatelets and statins for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. A wound care specialist was called for consultation to facilitate the management of his foot ulcer.  Follow-Up:  During follow-up  John reported significant improvement in his rest pain  and gradual healing of his foot ulcer was observed. He is to remain on regular follow-up every three months with repeat imaging every 6 months or sooner if his symptoms reoccur.  Conclusion:  John’s case illustrates the importance of early detection and management of CLI in a patient with multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis including diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Prompt endovascular intervention coupled with strict control of modifiable risk factors can lead to favorable outcomes in patients with CLI. 
7,9,20,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial20,Patient's Case Presentation  Demographic Information:   The patient is a 73-year-old Caucasian male  named Mr. Johnson with a history of heavy smoking (1 pack/day for the past 50 years). He is a retired auto mechanic  lives alone in a suburban area. He is widowed with two adult daughters who live out of state.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus over the past 20 years. Unfortunately  he has been quite inconsistent in adhering to his medication regimen due to his self-professed dislike of taking pills. He underwent angioplasty five years ago due to heart disease. Mr. Johnson is overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 30. He does not regularly exercise or follow a healthy diet  further worsening his existing chronic conditions.   Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Johnson visited the hospital with complaints of severe leg pain  which had worsened over the last few weeks. The pain primarily occurs in his right leg and is exacerbated during physical activity  but is present even during rest. He has also noticed a mild-to-moderate decrease in the temperature of his right leg compared to his left leg.   Physical Examination:  On examination  the right pedal pulse was notably weak  and the skin on the right foot appeared discolored and slightly atrophic. There were no ulcerations or open wounds but dry scaling was noticed. He also reported an increase in pain when his leg was elevated at 60 degrees and a decrease in pain when his leg was lowered to a dependent position.   Family History:  Mr. Johnson's family history is significant for heart disease and diabetes. His father had a heart attack at the age of 65 and his mother died at the age of 70 due to complications related to diabetes. His elder brother has survived two heart attacks and his younger sister is also diabetic.   Diagnostic Findings:  Given his symptoms  past medical history  and physical examination findings  Mr. Johnson was suspected to have critical limb ischemia. The diagnosis of CLI was confirmed through an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test  which was abnormally low  and a Doppler ultrasound  which revealed significant blockage in the right popliteal artery.  Treatment Plan:  The multidisciplinary vascular team determined that Mr. Johnson is a suitable candidate for revascularization surgery. In addition  he is referred to a dietician and physical therapist for lifestyle modification interventions to manage his diabetes and promote weight loss. The patient is also urged to start a smoking cessation program.  Prognosis:  The prognosis will greatly depend on Mr. Johnson's commitment to treatment and lifestyle changes. Long term outlook demonstration improvements with successful revascularization  optimized diabetes control  smoking cessation  disciplined dietary habits  weight management  and improvement in overall lifestyle. Early detection and intervention are key to managing CLI  and patient education is imperative for the prevention of potential future health issues.
7,9,21,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial21,CASE PRESENTATION:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named John  who lives in rural Iowa with his wife. It's a farming community  and he's a retired carpenter. He was a smoker for over 40 years with a pack of day but quit three years back.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. John presents with a one-month history of persistent pain within his left leg  particularly upon walking  that's been becoming progressively worse. Recently  he also noticed a non-healing wound on the big toe of the same foot.  Past Medical History: John's past medical records reveal that he is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years ago  which is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents but ill-controlled with an HbA1C of 9.4%. He also has a history of hypertension under medication. He has suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) five years ago.   Family History: John's medical family history reveals both his father and grandfather died of strokes  and his mother had peripheral artery disease (PAD). His two elder siblings are living with hypertension and diabetes too.  Clinical Examination: Physical examination findings revealed weak  barely palpable pulses in the left foot. The non-healing wound on the left foot's big toe appeared pale  with a punched-out appearance and minimal exudate.   Investigations and Diagnosis: An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test was performed  with results showing an ABI value of 0.45 in the left leg  significantly lower than the normal 1.0-1.4 value  which is indicative of peripheral arterial disease. Further investigations with Doppler ultrasound confirmed significantly decreased blood flow in the left popliteal and tibial arteries. Given his consistent symptoms  medical history  and the aforementioned test findings  John was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) of the left leg.  Treatment Plan: Under the vascular surgeon's guidance  John was recommended with an angioplasty in order to restore the blood flow. He was also recommended to optimize the management of his diabetes  along with cessation of smoking and initiation of an appropriate exercise regimen. However  considering his family history and past history of TIA  he was advised to undergo regular follow ups for early identification of complications. His family was counselled about the disease  its implications and the importance of lifestyle modifications.   This case highlights the complexity of CLI as it includes factors like advanced age  ill-managed diabetes  smoking  and genetic predisposition  creating a direct impact on the choice of the treatment modality and prognosis.
7,9,22,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial22,Patient Presentation:  Patient is Mr. Anderson  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presenting with worsening pain in his right lower extremity  especially at rest  and non-healing ulcers for the past two months. Mr. Anderson is a retired teacher  living with his wife in New York.  Past Medical History: Mr. Anderson has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  stage II hypertension  peripheral artery disease (PAD)  and hyperlipidemia. He has had a 35-year history of tobacco use  averaging one pack per day  but he has reportedly quit smoking 5 years ago. Besides  he had an ischemic stroke with near-complete recovery 6 years back.  Family History: His mother passed away in her 70s from Alzheimer's disease  and his father died at the age of 82 due to myocardial infarction. His older brother suffered a stroke in his early 70s  diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and PAD  indicating a clear family history of cardiovascular disease.  Examination & Diagnosis: On physical examination  Mr. Anderson appeared to be in moderate distress due to rest pain. His right lower extremity was evidently cooler than the left with weak pedal pulses and an ulcer over the right heel. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test revealed an ABI value of 0.5 in the right lower extremity  confirming severe PAD. Blood investigations showed an elevated HbA1c level. Following further angiography investigations  he was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Treatment & Management: Mr. Anderson was scheduled for PTA (Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty)  along with lifestyle modifications. Aggressive risk factor management  such as optimal glycemic and lipid control  was initiated. Additionally  he was referred to a dietician  a diabetes management nurse  and sessions on smoking cessation. Cilostazol was started for symptomatic relief  and a statin was prescribed for his LDL cholesterol.  Discussion: Mr. Anderson’s case represents a typical late-stage presentation of PAD  that is CLI. His risk factor profile included type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  elderly age  past tobacco use  and family history  which is consistent with those of many patients with PAD and CLI. Apart from the direct management of CLI  aggressive management of these modifiable risk factors forms the crux of management and secondary prevention in such cases.
7,9,23,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial23,Patient Case Presentation: Critical Limic Ischemia  Patient Information:    The patient is a 67-year-old male. His past medical history reveals that he has been a heavy smoker for the past 45 years. He is also known to suffer from type 2 diabetes and hypertension for the past 10 years which was under control with medications. The patient reports adherence to prescribed medications but has not managed to quit smoking. His family history reveals that his father succumbed to a myocardial infarction at an early age of 55  his mother has hypertension  and one of his two brothers is diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD).   Chief Complaint and Symptom History:  The patient presents with complaints of severe test pain that has been escalating over the past 4 months. He also describes painful cramping in his left leg  especially while walking. Notably  relief from pain usually only occurs when at rest. Additionally  he observes ulceration on his left foot which hasn't been healing for the past 6 weeks.  Physical Examination:  On examination  his blood pressure was 155/85 mmHg. His body mass index (BMI) is 28 indicating that he is overweight. His left leg showed signs of skin discoloration  a non-healing ulcer on the foot  and cold to touch compared to his right leg. Furthermore  the pulses including the dorasalis pedis and the posterior tibialis were not palpable on the left leg. No such abnormal signs were observed in the right leg.  Investigation and Diagnosis:  The patient's blood sugar level was found to be 210 mg/dl  an indication that the patient's diabetes is not well-managed. Fasting lipid profile showed elevated levels of LDL cholesterol (160mg/dL). Ankle-brachial index (ABI) revealed an index of 0.4 on the left leg compared to 1.1 on the right (normal ABI > 0.9). Doppler ultrasound of the left lower limb revealed decreased blood flow indicting arterial occlusion. Further angiography revealed severe stenosis in the distal left superficial femoral artery and posterior tibial artery. Based on the symptoms  physical examination  and investigations  a diagnosis of left leg critical limb ischemia (CLI) was confirmed.   It is essential to take immediate action for the patient. CLI is a serious condition that can put the patient at risk for limb amputation and life-threatening cardiovascular events if not managed timely. The patient will need a thorough evaluation by a vascular surgeon for potential revascularization procedures and aggressive control of risk factors. Referral to a dietician and diabetes educator may be warranted to help manage diabetes and promote weight loss. Smoking cessation is also important for this patient.
7,9,24,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial24,Case Presentation:  Patient Information: Ms. J  a 70-year-old  African American female with a BMI of 28  presented to the clinic with an extensive one-month history of increasing pain and progressive discoloration of her left lower extremity. She disclosed that the pain often worsened during physical activity but didn’t completely abate at rest.   Clinical and Family History: Ms. J has a critical medical history comprising of poorly controlled Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. She has been a chronic smoker for about 50 years with COPD recently diagnosed. Her father had passed away due to an acute myocardial infarction in his late 60s; however  nothing consequential was recorded on her mother's side. No known allergies or drug reactions have been reported. Ms. J lives alone  and she could manage her activities of daily living unassisted. She is retired and gains support from her children for a medical visit or financial needs.  Physical Examination:  On the left leg  examination revealed areas of skin discoloration  significant skin pallor  an absence of palpable distal pulses  and decreased sensation. No similar symptoms were noted on her right leg. Blood pressure readings have consistently been elevated above the normal range.   Investigations and Diagnosis:  Initial tests included complete blood count  fasting blood sugar levels  lipid profiles  and EKG. Given the symptoms and her comprehensive history  further diagnostic procedures including an Ankle Brachial Index and Doppler ultrasound of her lower extremity arterial system were also ordered.   Her ABI test recorded readings of less than 0.4 in her left leg  while her right leg results were within the expected range. The Doppler ultrasound showed significant stenotic features in her left lower limb's arterial circulation.   Combining her critical symptoms of significant leg pain at rest  discoloration  history of smoking  poorly managed diabetes  hypertension  and the results of her diagnostic investigation  Ms. J was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) on her left leg.  Management Plan:  The treatment plan was to primarily address the pain and aim for limb salvage. Ms. J's poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension were planned to be addressed with suitable changes in her medication and lifestyle modification  with the cessation of smoking being critical. She was referred for revascularization following her consent. Conservative wound care was advised  given her age  coupled with physiotherapy initiation upon the surgeon’s consent post-revascularization. She will be advised on closer and regular follow-ups and reassessed at every visit.   The coordinator set an appointment with both the vascular surgeon and the diabetologist  and her case was discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting to ensure a holistic approach to her management.
7,9,25,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial25,Patient Profile: The patient is a 72-year-old African-American male  John Smith  a retired construction worker  residing in downtown Dallas. He is known to have underlying medical conditions such as type II diabetes mellitus (duration of 18 years)  hypertension (duration of 20 years)  and peripheral artery disease in both legs (diagnosed six years ago). Both of his parents died at an early age due to cardiovascular events. He is a former smoker and consumed two packs daily for 40 years but quit about ten years ago.   Chief Complaint: The patient primarily complains of severe pain in his left foot for the past two weeks.  History of Present Illness: Mr. Smith has been experiencing excruciating pain in his left foot which exacerbates during the night even while at rest. He describes the pain as burning  sharp  and unrelenting. Along with the pain  he also noticed skin discoloration on his left foot – it appears dark blue  almost black. He also reported a decrease in temperature of his left foot compared to the other and an ulcer on his toe that has been persistent for a month. His right foot is mildly symptomatic  with occasional claudication after walking long distances.  Physical Examination: Upon further examination  distal pulses were absent in his left foot  including tibialis posterior and dorsalis pedis. The rest of the cardiovascular examination was normal  with no obvious signs of failure. Neurological examination revealed a decreased sensation over the left foot compared with the right.  Investigations: Doppler Ultrasound was carried out which showed significantly decreased blood flow in the left foot compared to the right. A blood sample was collected and sent for routine investigations.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation and test results  the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia of the left lower limb was made.   Management: The patient was started on medications including aspirin and statins  along with optimal control of diabetes and hypertension. Consultation with the vascular surgery department was made for possible revascularization in view of the severe symptoms including rest pain and ulceration.  In conclusion  the patient's case is challenging due to the complexity of underlying peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia alongside poorly controlled diabetes. A holistic  team-based approach is required for optimal health outcomes. Smoking cessation education and motivational interviewing are further recommended to ensure the patient fully understands the risk factors and management plan.

She has been retired for a decade. She is a widow and lives alone  but she has three grown-up children who live in close proximity and assist her as needed.  II. Reason for Admission   The primary reason for admission is severe  worsening pain in both legs  particularly noticeable at rest. The pain has become increasingly debilitating over the past three months  affecting her mobility and quality of life.  III. Past Medical History   She has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 for the past 15 years and has been on Metformin. The patient was also diagnosed with high blood pressure around ten years ago for which she takes Lisinopril. She underwent a left breast mastectomy five years ago for stage 2b breast cancer and has been in remission since completion of chemotherapy and radiation.  IV. Lifestyle and Habits   The patient is a former smoker; she quit 30 years ago. She consumes alcohol occasionally and maintains a moderately balanced diet in congruence with her diabetic condition. Her physical activity has been limited lately due to leg pain.  V. Family History   Her father died from a stroke in his late 70s and her mother had hypertension and diabetes  passing away in her mid-80s due to heart failure. Her elder brother and sister are alive and well  with her brother having type 2 diabetes as well.  VI. Examination & Investigations    The lower limbs appear discolored with reduced hair growth. The posterior tibial pulse is weak and femoral pulse is absent bilaterally. An Ankle-Brachial Index was 0.6 bilaterally. Further investigations included duplex ultrasonography showing severe bilateral stenosis in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries.  VII. Diagnosis  Based on history and clinical findings  the patient was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI).  VIII. Treatment and Prognosis  The patient was referred for vascular consultation  and after the diagnosis of CLI  a revascularization procedure was advised. She will continue her current medications for diabetes and hypertension. Smoking cessation (passive too) and better glycemic control were stressed. Prognosis largely depends on her response to the revascularization therapy and how well she manages her diabetes and hypertension.
7,9,27,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial27,Patient Introduction: The patient is a 66-year-old African American male named Mr. John Preston. He lives alone in an urban setting  is a retired accountant  and is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history. The patient is generally independent in his activities of daily living.  Medical History: Mr. Preston has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes  hyperlipidemia  hypertension  and peripheral artery disease (PAD). His medications include daily metformin  atorvastatin  and lisinopril. He had two episodes of cardiac arrest  and he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) about 5 years ago. He has been exhibiting chronic symptoms of claudication  particularly in the right lower extremity  which have progressively worsened.  Family History: His mother died suddenly at the age of 70  but the cause of death is unknown. His father suffered from coronary artery disease and died at 65 due to myocardial infarction. One sibling has type 2 diabetes  while the other sibling is healthy.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Preston presented to the outpatient department with severe rest pain in his right lower limb  foot ulcers that were not healing for the past two months  and progressive weakness. The pain typically worsens when he lies down and slightly alleviates when the limb is in a dependent position. He also reported a recent weight loss and reduced appetite.   Examination and Investigations: On examination  the right lower limb was noticeably pale and cold compared to the left. Pedal pulses were impalpable on the right side. A wound on the right lateral malleolus  approximately measuring 2 cm x 2 cm  was noticed experiencing delayed healing. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed  with a low score reported in the right compared to the left leg  supporting the diagnosis of PAD.   Doppler Ultrasound revealed a significant loss of blood flow in multiple arteries of the right lower extremity. His fasting glucose  HbA1c  and lipid profile confirmed poor diabetes and hyperlipidemia control.   Diagnosis: Combining his medical history  presenting complaint  physical examination  and investigation results  Mr. Preston was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to advanced peripheral artery disease  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia.   Treatment Plan: Mr. Preston's management plan involves an interdisciplinary team including a vascular surgeon  endocrinologist  dietitian  and physical therapist. His immediate referral was made to a vascular surgeon for possible angioplasty  stenting  or bypass. His diabetic medications were changed  and insulin therapy was initiated to gain better glycemic control. Changes in his diet were also recommended for better management of diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Pain management and wound care were also prioritized for symptomatic relief and prevention of potential infection.    Follow-Up: Mr. Preston needs regular follow-ups with his endocrinologist for continuous monitoring of his blood glucose levels & HbA1C and with his primary care physician to monitor his cholesterol levels & blood pressure. Physical rehabilitation was suggested to help improve his walking endurance and overall cardiovascular health.    Patient Education: Mr. Preston was educated about the importance of medication compliance  routine exercise  regular foot inspections  and frequent follow-ups for achieving better health outcomes and manage potential complications related to critical limb ischemia  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. He was also informed about the benefits of smoking cessation and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
7,9,28,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial28,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 67-year-old African-American male  known as Mr. Benjamin. He has been a regular patient at the clinic for the past 24 years.  Past Medical History: Mr. Benjamin has a long-standing history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he had been seeking treatment and medication. He has a 45-year history of smoking approximately one pack of cigarettes daily  but claims to have quit about five years ago. Six months ago  he was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). There is no known history of coagulation disorders.  Family History: His father passed away due to a heart attack in his late sixties. His mother passed away at 83 due to stroke. He has one brother who is healthy and no history of vascular disease in the remaining family.  Presenting Problem: Over the past few weeks  Mr. Benjamin has experienced a progressive increase in leg pain  particularly in his right calf  even at rest. Due to the severe pain  he has difficulty sleeping at night and has deteriorated quality of life. This pain also restricts his mobility significantly.  Examination and Diagnosis: On physical examination  his right foot was pale  cold to touch and there was an absence of pulses below the right knee. The Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) in his right leg was significantly reduced  pointing towards advanced limb ischemia. Additionally  Bedside Doppler also substantiated the absence of arterial blood flow.  Investigations and Findings: We followed up with a CT angiogram which showed blockages in the right lower limb arteries. He was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  with Rutherford's Clinically staged Category 4.  Management Plan: Given the severity of CLI  his elevated surgical risk due to the presence of hypertension and diabetes  we plan to initiate an aggressive medical therapy  including antiplatelets  statins  and optimization of his diabetes and hypertension control. We also plan to do an endovascular or surgical revascularization based on the heart team's decision.   Future Considerations: Options for revascularization will be decided collectively by the heart team  where the patient's anatomical  clinical  and personal preference will be considered. Given the presence of severe limb ischemia  the ultimate goal will be limb salvage and improvement in the quality of life. A critical part of therapy will be smoking cessation and initiation of a walking program post-revascularization.   Prognosis:  With aggressive management and suitable revascularization  we anticipate an improvement in Mr. Benjamin's symptoms and an increase in his overall quality of life. However  he is at considerable risk of cardiovascular events given his smoking history and comorbid conditions  and therefore  close follow-up will be necessary.
7,9,29,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial29,Patient's Profile: Mrs. Julia Svensson  an 85-year-old Caucasian female  has presented several times in our medical facility with the chief complaint of painful leg ulcers and intermittent claudication. She has a 45-year-old history of smoking two packs a day  a prominent risk factor for peripheral artery disease (PAD). Her files reveal a past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  and a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Presenting Issue: Mrs. Svensson presented to the vascular clinic for a routine follow-up  however  over the past year  her condition has deteriorated. She complains of recurrent non-healing foot ulcers and resting pain in her right leg. She developed symptoms of critical limb ischemia  including discoloration of foot and the presence of non-healing ulcers. The pain has been known to disrupt her sleep  with it worsening at night.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed absent right pedal and posterior tibial pulses. The right leg was significantly cooler compared with the left one. She had right foot discoloration  and motor power in the right foot was 3/5. Doppler ultrasound showed severe stenosis in the right distal superficial femoral artery and occlusion of the right popliteal artery and anterior tibial artery. Laboratory tests indicated a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 9.2% and LDL cholesterol of 160 mg/dL.  Diagnosis and Treatment Plan: Based on clinical findings  Doppler ultrasound results  and symptomatology  Mrs. Svensson was diagnosed with right leg critical limb ischemia caused by severe PAD. Given her age and medical condition  amputation was taken into consideration. However  knowing its life-altering effects and Mrs. Svensson's personal preference  a conservative approach was adopted. She was treated with a supervised  detailed plan for glycaemic and cholesterol control. Pain control was prioritized using analgesics  and antibiotics were administered for the ulcer. Smoking cessation was encouraged  and she was referred to a dietician to support her in managing diabetes.  Considering the severity and complexity of Mrs. Svensson's condition  a multidisciplinary team was put together. Her treatment involved optimization medication  endovascular intervention  wound care  and regular monitoring of her disease status and quality of life.  Future Recommendations: PAD and critical limb ischemia require continuous medical attention. If Mrs. Svensson does not respond to conservative management or shows signs of worsening symptoms  endovascular or surgical procedures will potentially be considered. Mrs. Svensson is advised to attend regular follow-up examinations and adhere to the treatment regimen to reduce the risk of disease progression.
7,9,30,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial30,Patient Presentation  Mr. X  a 68-year-old African-American male  presents with complaints of severe pain in his right lower leg that has persisted for the last three weeks. The pain is most severe when he is walking and lessens when he's at rest but never completely resolves. He also reports non-healing ulcers on his right foot that have been present for about a month. Upon inspection  his right foot appears to be pale with weak pulses in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries.   Medical History  Mr. X has a known past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 15 years ago)  hypertension (HTN)  hyperlipidemia  and coronary artery disease (CAD). He currently takes metformin  lisinopril  atorvastatin  and aspirin. He has a history of smoking for the last 20 years but quit smoking five years ago. Mr. X was compliant with his medications and was taking regular follow ups for his longstanding conditions. There are no known allergies. A history of intermittent claudication was reported a year ago.   Family History  Mr X's family history revealed that his father suffered from peripheral artery disease and his mother had a longstanding history of type II Diabetes Mellitus  while his older brother passed away due to myocardial infarction at an early age of 50 years.   Investigations and Diagnosis  Mr. X’s Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed and was 0.4 on the right  suggestive of severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). A Doppler ultrasound showed decreased blood flow to his right lower leg  corroborating with his ABI test results.   After correlating the patient's symptoms of constant pain in legs at rest  non-healing foot ulcers  physical examination findings of weak pulses and critical ABI scores with his medical history of diabetes  CAD and HTN  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made.   Management and Planned Follow-Up  He was started on conservative management with optimal wound care for his foot ulcers and maximum medical therapy including statins  antiplatelet and antihypertensive drugs. A Vascular Surgery consult was sought for potential revascularization  and the findings were explained to him and his family. A regular follow-up bi-monthly is planned to monitor his condition and symptoms.   This case emphasizes the importance of early detection and management in patients who are at high risk  such as those with a history of diabetes  smoking and known cardiovascular diseases  where the progression of PAD to CLI can significantly increase the risk of limb amputation and mortality.
7,9,31,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial31,Subject: 68-year-old Caucasian Male diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Initials: J.D.  Demographics:  J.D. is a 68-year-old Caucasian male currently residing in upstate New York. He is a retired construction worker  a former smoker who quit about ten years ago  and has a history of excessive alcohol consumption. He is unmarried and lives alone.  Past Medical History:  J.D. has a comprehensive history of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) diagnosed at age 60. He was also diagnosed with Hypertension and Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) five years later. Other past diagnoses include mild Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) from long-term tobacco use and hyperlipidemia. He underwent a minimally invasive procedure to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm two years ago. He is compliant with medication - hypertension (Atenolol)  diabetes (Metformin  Sitagliptin)  and hyperlipidemia (Atorvastatin).  Family History:  His father had died from myocardial infarction at 56  and his mother was diagnosed with T2DM  whereas his elder brother and sister are both hypertensive. No known family history of any malignancies or genetic disorders.  Presenting Issues:  J.D. visited the hospital complaining of severe pain in his right lower limb  particularly while resting  and some intermittent claudication for the past three months. He also showed signs of Ischemic ulcers and noted an unintentional weight loss (6 kg in 3 months). On examination  his right foot was pallid  cold to touch  and there were signs of gangrene in the toes. His brachial BP was 140/90 mm Hg  and his right ankle pressure was non-recordable. Arterial Doppler ultrasound of the right lower limb indicated no flow below the knee.  Impression:  Upon inspection and taking into consideration his past and current medical history  J.D. was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia  stage III Rutherford category based on clinical presentations.  Plan:  The patient requires further investigations including CTA/MRA to visualize the runoff vessels. Following this  he will likely be considered for revascularization procedures either via angioplasty or bypass surgery taking into consideration his comorbid conditions. Plastic surgery consultation may be necessary for wound debridement. A dedicated care plan including personalized diabetic  blood pressure  and cholesterol management  along with a smoking cessation program has been recommended. Moreover  the possibility of a need for amputation  if revascularization fails or is not feasible  was discussed.    Mental Health Considerations:  It will be vital for the healthcare providers to monitor J.D.'s mental health condition  given the potential psychological impact of his diagnosis and subsequent treatments. A referral for psychological counselling may be necessary.  Notes:   This case requires careful follow-up due to the presence of several risk factors for accelerated atherosclerosis  such as diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Early detection and management of any similar cases in the family can help reduce further health complications.

He is a widower and lives with his older daughter. His primary language is English and he is under Medicare for his health coverage.  Presenting Problem: Mr. W.J. presented to the clinic with complaints of unrelenting pain in his left lower leg  especially at night. He mentioned that this has disrupted his sleep. He also reported the presence of a non-healing wound on his left foot for the past several weeks. He has not been able to walk more than a few steps without discomfort  resorting to using a wheelchair for movement.  Medical History:  He has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes for 15 years and hypertension for 10 years. He was a pack-a-day smoker but quit 5 years ago. His medical records show that his diabetes and hypertension control have been suboptimal in the past  but he has been compliant with his medications in recent years.  Family History: His father had coronary artery disease and passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 82. His mother passed away from ovarian cancer at the age of 75. He has a younger brother (73 years old) who has diabetes and hypertension.  Diagnostic Assessment: Upon clinical examination  there were weak peripheral pulses in the left foot and a small ulcer (2cm in diameter) on the left big toe. There was no palpable pulse in the left foot  suggesting critical limb ischemia. Ankle-Brachial index was 0.4 in the left lower limb. Confirmation of critical limb ischemia was achieved by imaging studies (CT angiography revealed severe peripheral arterial disease).  Management: The patient was immediately referred to a vascular specialist for further assessment and management. The plan involved initiating an intensive regimen of glycemic control  strict blood pressure control  lifestyle modifications  statins  and antiplatelet therapy. The potential for revascularization was also discussed.  Education: Patient was educated about the importance of diabetic and hypertension control  regular foot self-inspection  and lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise.  Follow-up Plan: Regular follow-ups at the clinic were scheduled to monitor his progress  ulcer healing  and control of his diabetes and hypertension.

He has two adult children living in different states who visit him quarterly. Mr. R is a former smoker and quit smoking approximately 20 years ago  but he continues to have moderate alcohol consumption.   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. R was initially presented to the hospital with severe pain in his right lower extremity  especially during activity (claudication)  which gradually advanced over six months to rest pain. He complained of changing skin color to pale and coolness of the foot. He also reported ulcers on his toes that aren't healing.  Relevant Past Medical History:  Mr. R has a significant past medical history  including type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 15 years ago  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and coronary artery disease  for which he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery seven years back.  Current Medications:  He is currently on Metformin  Lisinopril  Simvastatin  and Aspirin.  Family History:   His father had coronary artery disease and died in his late 70s from a myocardial infarction. His mother had diabetes and hypertension; she lived into her 90s. One of his two siblings had a stroke in her early 80s.  Physical Examination:  On examination  his right foot was pale  colder in comparison to the other. There were non-healing ulcers on his distal toes. Distal pulses (posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis) were feeble.  Pertinent Lab and Radiological findings:  Laboratory results showed elevated blood glucose and lipid profile. His ABI (Ankle brachial index) was low at 0.5  suggestive of significant peripheral arterial disease. A Doppler ultrasound revealed multilevel peripheral arterial disease with right femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal arterial occlusions.   Diagnosis and Future Planning:  The clinical presentation and the investigations confirmed the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia of the right lower limb. Mr. R was started on pain relievers and anticoagulants initially. He is being evaluated for possible angioplasty  stenting or bypass graft surgery based on his comorbid state  the severity of his illness  and life expectancy. His diabetes and hyperlipidemia will need better control. Discussions about the lifestyle changes  including diet and exercising  have been introduced.  This case highlights the necessity of early diagnosis and intervention in patients with critical limb ischemia  especially in those with multiple high-risk factors such as diabetes  smoking history  and family history of vascular disease. It also underscores the importance of lifestyle modifications and strict control of comorbidities to prevent or slow down the progress of the disease.
7,9,34,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial34,Patient Presentation:  Mr. X is a 65-year-old African-American male who was admitted to our hospital complaining of severe pain and swelling in his right lower leg. He described the pain as persistent and said it seemed to worsen when he attempted to walk. The patient disclosed that he has been a chronic smoker for over 40 years.   Past Medical History:  Mr. X was diagnosed with diabetes and high blood pressure 10 years ago  which he manages through diet  exercise  and medication. He had a partial colectomy for colorectal cancer three years ago  and has since been in remission. He also suffers from occasional episodes of atrial fibrillation for which he is taking Warfarin.  Demographics:  The patient is retired and resides with his wife in the countryside. He used to be a factory worker  is a non-drinker but continues to smoke despite numerous attempts to quit.  Family History:  Mr. X’s family history reveals that his father passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 70  and his mother had a long-standing history of diabetes mellitus. One of his brothers has hypertension and the other has a history of intermittent claudication.  Current Presentation:  Upon physical examination  the patient's BP was 145/90 mmHg  pulse 76 bpm  afebrile  respiratory rate of 18 bpm and oxygen saturation levels were 97% on ambient air. Examination of his legs has shown changes consistent with severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  which include lower skin temperature in his right leg  a weak right leg pulse  and absent pulses in the right foot. His right foot also showed signs of trophic changes with non-healing ulcers on the tips of his toes.  Investigation & Diagnosis:  The patient's ankle-brachial index (ABI) was alarmingly low suggesting PAD. A peripheral angiography confirmed severe blockages in the right lower leg and foot arteries. The findings are suggestive of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  The patient was duly informed of his diagnosis and discussed options for revascularization. Recommendation for an immediate surgical intervention was given considering the extent of arterial blockage.  This case underscores the fact that early identification and optimal management of risk factors can prevent or delay the onset of complications like CLI.

7,9,35,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial35,Patient Presentation  Introduction: Mr. Smith is an 81-year-old Caucasian male patient diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He was referred to our facility after presenting with extensive pain in his left lower extremity that increases with activity and drastically limits his mobility.  Demographics: He lives with his 83-year-old wife in a single-story house in a suburban community. He is a retired engineer and has three adult children who live locally. He quit smoking 20 years ago but had a 35-year history of smoking prior (1.5 packs a day). He rarely drinks alcohol  usually only on special occasions.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has previously been diagnosed with hypertension (for which he has long been controlled on a beta-blocker) and peripheral vascular disease  diagnosed five years ago. He has a history of hyperlipidemia  which is managed by a statin. He has not been diagnosed or treated for diabetes. He underwent coronary bypass surgery around ten years ago and has been maintaining well since.  Family History: His mother died at 70 years due to a stroke  and his father died at 75 years due to heart disease. His older brother was diagnosed with lung cancer at 67 years and passed away a year later.  Presenting complaints and Associated Symptoms: The patient reports suffering from rest pain for approximately six months  where the pain intensified in the past week. The pain  located chiefly in his left foot  has transitioned from initially only being present during exercise to being noticeable even at rest. The pain is severe enough to disturb his sleep. He has also noticed that his foot appears more pale than usual and feels cooler to touch.  Physical Examination: On examination  his left foot was indeed paler than the right and was cool to touch. His distal pulses were not palpable  and there was reduced hair on his left leg. There were no apparent lesions or ulcers noted.  Conclusion: The features suggest an exacerbation of his critical limb ischemia. This is concerning and needs immediate evaluation and intervention to reduce his pain and to prevent further complications such as ulcers or even gangrene. His exacerbating limb ischemia puts him at high risk for major amputation or death if it's not managed appropriately.  Management Plan: Urgent vascular consultation has been sought for potential revascularization procedures. He was started on dual antiplatelet therapy and high dose statins to reduce the risk of plaque rupture and subsequent thrombosis.  This case presents important education points regarding the risk factors  presentation  and management of critical limb ischemia. Particularly in patients with peripheral vascular disease  it highlights the importance of early recognition of symptoms and seeking immediate medical attention.
7,9,36,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial36,Patient Information: Mr. John  a 68-year-old African American male  presented with a month-long history of severe pain in his left leg that has grown steadily worse over a week. Originally from Raleigh  North Carolina  he is a widower  retired mechanic and father to three adult children. His past medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes  which has been fairly well-controlled with medication despite occasional neglect  and a 40-pack year smoking history.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. John reported intermittent claudication initially  followed by a progressive escalation in pain in his leg  particularly when at rest. Examination showed his left foot to appear pale with reduced skin temperature compared with the contralateral limb  absent distal pulses  and non-healing ulcers on his toes - pointing towards Critical Limb Ischemia.  Past Medical History: His notable medical history involves obesity (BMI: 31.2)  a 10-year history of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus  and hypertension diagnosed seven years ago. He was prescribed Metformin and Lisinopril  but his compliance had been inconsistent at best.  Family History: Mr. John’s family history includes his father passed away from stroke at age 73 and a younger brother diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease in his 50s. No known history of similar presentation in other family members.   Life Style and Social History: John is a widower; his wife died 10 years ago due to breast cancer. He lives alone but is visited regularly by his children. He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking cigarettes and admits to continued tobacco use.  Clinical Findings: On examination  distal pulses (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial) in his left foot are absent  and signs of necrosis are present in his big toe. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test was done which displayed a value of 0.3 in left leg (lower than normal). These signs pointed at the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.   Investigations: His investigations revealed glucose levels and HbA1c indicating poorly controlled diabetes. His lipid profile was abnormal with high LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol. Doppler ultrasound showed decreased blood flow in the left popliteal artery and in the vessels of the lower leg  indicating severe peripheral artery disease.  Treatment and Prognosis: He was admitted to the vascular surgical team promptly. An extensive discussion was held regarding potential treatment options  including angioplasty  bypass surgery  or potentially amputation  if limb salvage is not feasible. His condition is severe and will necessitate immediate intervention to prevent limb loss. To help prevent future health issues  Mr. John has been advised to quit smoking  follow a holistic diabetes management plan  and consider initiation of statin and antiplatelet therapy post-surgery.  This case of Mr. John reflects the importance of maintaining meticulous glucose control and smoking cessation in preventing the development and progression of complications related to diabetes and peripheral artery disease. It also underlines the urgency and complexity of managing critical limb ischemia.
7,9,37,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial37,Patient Information:   Mr. A is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who was referred to the Vascular Surgery department due to concerns around Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The patient lives with his wife and has two adult children. He is retired from a lifelong career in construction. Mr. A is a smoker with a 50 pack-year history  drinks alcohol sporadically  and denies illicit drug use.  Presenting Problem:  Mr. A has been experiencing progressive  severe pain in his right lower extremity  particularly in the calf and foot. The pain persists at rest and has interrupted his sleep pattern for the past month. On presentation  he displayed signs of tissue loss on his toes  suspected to result from ischemia.   Past Medical History:   Mr. A has an established history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which have been managed with medication for the last ten years. He was diagnosed as prediabetic two years ago and has demonstrated a lack of compliance with the prescribed dietary regulations. In addition  he suffers from mild osteoarthritis but is otherwise generally fit.  Family History:   His father passed away from myocardial infarction at the age of 58  and his mother had peripheral artery disease and passed away at 76 due to stroke-related complications. His older brother was recently diagnosed with coronary artery disease.   Clinical Examination and Investigations:   An Ankle-brachial Index (ABI) was performed which showed an index of 0.4 on the right side which correlates with severe arterial disease. A Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) revealed significant stenosis of the right superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery  with multiple occlusions of the tibial and peroneal arteries  consistent with CLI.  Diagnosis:  Based on clinical presentation and investigation findings  Mr. A was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Plan/Management:  The team plan involves primarily managing Mr. A's risk factors that contribute to his CLI. He has been recommended to cease smoking and to undergo dietary changes. A referral to a dietitian has been made in order to properly manage his prediabetes. The patient will likely need an angioplasty or a more extensive revascularization procedure depending on the findings during angiography. Wound care for his toes will be conducted and monitored closely. Collaboration from the Cardiology department may also be necessary due to the family history of cardiac disease and the correlation between peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease.
7,9,38,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial38,Patient Information: Ms. X.M.  a 75-year-old Caucasian female  presents with complaints of rest pain and ischemic ulcerations on her left lower extremity. Her past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 50-pack year smoking history which she quit 5 years ago. She's a retired school teacher living alone  with two adult sons living in nearby cities. Her family history is significant for peripheral artery disease (PAD) in her father who underwent revascularization in his late 60s.  History of Present Illness: Ms. M. reports experiencing increased discomfort in her left leg over the past few months  escalating to more severe pain in the last 4 weeks  particularly at night. In addition to this  she also has wound development on her toes and heel that is non-healing and has worsened in the last 2 weeks. Ms. M. admits to delaying her visit to the hospital due to concerns related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Physical Exam: On physical examination  Ms. M.'s left foot is found to be pale with noticeable temperature drop. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses on her left foot are not palpable. There are three ulcers on her left foot  two on her toes and one on her heel. Distal sensation and motor function intact.   Investigations: Laboratory investigations reveal HbA1c of 7.8%  blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg  and lipid panel indicates elevated LDL (143 mg/dL). Ankle-brachial index (ABI) demonstrates significantly reduced ABI of 0.40 on the left side while a Doppler ultrasound confirms the presence of multilevel stenosis and occlusion in the left leg.   Diagnosis: She was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  stage 4  of her left lower extremity  secondary to peripheral artery disease.  Treatment: The patient is being considered for revascularization therapy after multidisciplinary consultation due to her severe rest pain and limb threatening ischemia. The risks have been discussed in terms of benefits vs harm. She will also be managed by the diabetes control team  advised on dietary assessment  and a supervised exercise programme.  Follow-up: Weekly monitoring of the healing process of the ulcers and to assess the effect of measures taken. Further investigations or referrals will be decided based on the progress.  Prognosis: Her prognosis depends on several factors  including her response to the revascularization therapy  wound healing  diabetes control  and potential for lifestyle modifications.   Psychosocial Aspects: She seems anxious about her condition  especially the potential need for amputation. Stressing the importance of regular follow-ups  and clarifying doubts about the nature of her disease and the importance of lifestyle modifications (diet  exercise) in managing her condition might help alleviate her fears. Seeking support from a mental health professional or case manager might be beneficial.
7,9,39,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial39,Patient Background: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male who lives in a suburban area. He is a retired high school teacher and has a history of smoking for almost 30 years  although he quit about five years ago. He has presented with pain in his lower extremities.  Past Medical History: Important highlights from the patient’s past medical history include hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operation about ten years ago and has been managing his diabetes for fifteen years. He has been adhering to his prescribed medications  including metformin  lisinopril  and rosuvastatin. He tested negative for peripheral neuropathy.  Current Issue: The patient has been experiencing severe pain in his right foot for the past few weeks  exacerbated when he walks even short distances or climbs stairs. Apart from the pain  he has also noticed a gradual discoloration of his foot  appearing slightly blue.   Family History: His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 76. His mother has a history of type 2 diabetes and is currently alive and well at age 85. His younger brother  aged 66  was recently diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease.  Examinations: Upon physical examination  both feet were cool to the touch. Pulse in the right foot was significantly attenuated compared to the left. No ulcerations were observed but there was an evident discoloration. Blood tests showed controlled glucose levels with an HbA1c of 7.2%  but his cholesterol was slightly out of range.   Diagnosis and Discussion: Based on his history  symptoms  and physical examination  he was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe form of peripheral arterial disease. Considering his previous smoking history  hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  his risk for developing CLI is considerably high.   Plan of Treatment: The multidisciplinary approach would include endovascular or surgical revascularization based on the patient's angiogram report. Aggressive control of hyperlipidemia  hypertension  and diabetes were suggested  with consultation from an endocrinologist and cardiologist. A cessation of his prior smoking habit was commended. Due to his symptoms and arterial Doppler results  the vascular surgery team has been consulted for potential intervention. The patient was informed with his family about the disease process  importance of medication  and lifestyle modifications needed to manage his health condition effectively.   This case of CLI highlights the importance of early detection and comprehensive management of risk factors in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

Resides in a suburban environment with his wife. Works as a retired engineer.  Past Medical History (PMH): History of poorly managed type 2 diabetes mellitus for 20 years  peripheral artery disease (PAD) secondary to atherosclerosis for five years  hypertension for ten years  and dyslipidemia for eight years. History of smoking is approximately 30 pack-years. No history of alcohol or drug abuse.  Medications: Regular medications include metformin 500mg mornings and evenings for diabetes  valsartan 80mg in mornings for hypertension  and atorvastatin 40mg in evenings for high cholesterol.  Family History (FH): His father had myocardial infarction (heart attack) and died at 74. Mother  who lived to 84  had a cerebral stroke. He has one brother  aged 70  who has had coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) secondary to ischemic heart disease.   Social History (SH): Married with two grown-up children  both in good health. The patient is a retired engineer  now living a sedentary lifestyle. He does not drink alcohol and relinquished smoking ten years ago.  Presenting complaints: The patient reported severe pain in his left lower extremity  worsening with walking but also present at rest  especially at night. An evaluation conducted seven days ago indicated lesions  non-healing wounds on two toes of his left foot.   Physical Examination (PE): Pale  cold left foot with a weak or even absent pulse  no edema. Ulcers on the tips of his big and second toe. No sensory impairment found.  Investigations: EDGE Doppler ultrasound of the left lower extremity confirmed severe blockages in the arteries that supply blood to the foot and toes. HbA1c is 8%  indicating suboptimal glucose control. Serum lipid profile shows elevation in LDL cholesterol.  Diagnosis: Mr. Smith was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain  ulcers  or gangrene attributable to objectively proven arterial occlusive disease.  Treatment: Revascularization was decided. The patient will undergo angiography and subsequently angioplasty  with stent placement if necessary. He was also prescribed insulin for glycemic control  wound care  antibiotic therapy  and lifestyle changes to control risk factors.  Prognosis: As per the current scenario  the prognosis for Mr. Smith is concerning. If left untreated  CLI can result in limb amputation. However  if revascularization is successful  along with optimized medical therapy and pertinent lifestyle changes  prognosis can be significantly improved.   Overall  the case presentation of this gentleman emphasizes the complexities of managing chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension that  when poorly controlled  can lead to serious implications like CLI. It also signals the importance of generalized atherosclerosis control and early detection of PAD.

He has had hypertension for the past 20 years  and uncontrolled Type-2 diabetes for 15 years  with occasional episodes of hyperglycemia. There are no known drug allergies. His regular medications are metformin  lisinopril  metoprolol  and atorvastatin.  Family Medical History:  Mr. K.'s father died from an MI at 60  and his mother had a stroke at 69. One of his two siblings  a younger brother  has Type-2 diabetes and hypertension  whereas his sister is relatively healthy.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  Mr. K.'s right foot was cold to touch  with absent dorsal pedal and posterior tibial pulses. The foot showed signs of mottling and necrotic tissue at the heel  indicating critical limb ischemia. Symptoms include severe pain and numbness in the foot  even while resting. The left foot appears normal with palpable pulses and no significant findings.   His laboratory tests revealed uncontrolled blood glucose levels and abnormal lipid profile. His Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was extremely low at 0.3 (Normal ABI is 1.0-1.4).   Clinical Course and Discussion:  Given the patient's heavy smoking history  uncontrolled diabetes  and overall cardiovascular history  he has a significant risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and critical limb ischemia. The clinical findings support the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia in the patient's right foot and lower leg. Mr. K. requires immediate treatment  encompassing revascularization procedure  wound care  and aggressive risk factor modification  including smoking cessation and strict diabetes control. The case illustrates the influence of poor lifestyle choices and uncontrolled diabetes on the development and progression of peripheral arterial disease and critical limb ischemia.

She also reported difficulty in walking and an increased dependence on her children for daily activities.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Lab results revealed elevated triglyceride levels  LDL cholesterol  and diminished HDL cholesterol  consistent with her past medical history of dyslipidemia. An Ankle-Brachial Index registered a value of less than 0.4 in her left lower limb. She was referred for an arteriogram which revealed severe disease with multiple occlusions in the left lower limb. A toe-brachial pressure index was also completed with a value less than 0.1.  All clinical findings  lab tests  and Alice's extensive history of peripheral artery disease  we diagnosed her with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which significantly reduces blood flow to the lower extremities.  Treatment and Management Plan:  She was immediately prescribed antiplatelet therapy and statins  along with the strict reinforcement of her antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications. She was referred to vascular surgery for a possible revascularization procedure considering the severity of her condition. She is currently awaiting her procedure.  Prognosis:  The prognosis for Alice’s condition largely depends on her upcoming surgical intervention and how well her diabetes and hypertension will be controlled. It is essential for her to emphasize diet  exercise  and strict medication compliance moving forward.

7,9,51,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial51,Patient Presentation:  Patient Summary:  Our subject is a 75-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Richards  presenting symptoms congruent with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).   Past medical history: Mr. Richards has a known history of Type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Despite being on medication  his blood glucose and lipid levels have been poorly controlled over the years. Consequently  he has had previous hospitalizations due to diabetic foot ulcers. Moreover  he has a 30-year pack smoking history  which he quit almost five years ago.  Family History: Both of his parents had cardiovascular diseases. His father  deceased at 65  suffered from myocardial infarction  while his mother  deceased at 70  had a stroke. His elder brother  77  has peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Current Scenario: Mr. Richards visited the hospital complaining of severe rest pain in his right lower limb that's been progressing over the past two months. The pain predominantly bothers him at night and is temporarily relieved by hanging his leg over the edge of the bed. He noted a wound on his right foot that has been present for the past three weeks  showing signs of poor healing.   Physical Examination: On examination  his right foot was pale with diminished popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial pulses. The wound was located on his right heel and surrounded by dry  scaly skin with peripheral cyanosis. His Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was 0.4  indicating an abnormal result.   Treatment Plan: Considering Mr. Richards' medical history  his presenting symptoms  physical findings  and his high risk factors - including poor diabetes control  smoking  and family predisposition to PAD  he was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia. He was referred to a vascular surgeon for revascularization procedures and a plastic surgeon for wound management. Medication was optimized for better control of his underlying chronic health problems.  Future Implications and Prevention: Mr. Richards is at high risk for major amputation if not appropriately managed. He was advised to maintain strict control of his blood glucose and cholesterol levels and to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle. Emphasis was made on regular foot inspection  proper foot care  and immediate reporting of any abnormalities.   This case highlights the essential role of early detection and treatment to prevent the devastating outcomes associated with the advanced stages of peripheral artery disease. Regular collaboration and follow-up with endocrinologist  cardiologist  and podiatrist are established for multidisciplinary management.  Additional Note: Critical Limb Ischemia is a severe form of PAD that needs urgent attention. It's a strong predictor for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Through awareness and early identification  the adverse outcomes can be prevented  and the quality of life in patients with CLI can be improved.
7,9,52,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial52,Patient Presentation  Our patient is a 63-year-old African American male named Mr. Roberts  who is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife of 40 years. He has been a heavy smoker for nearly 45 years  consuming a pack of cigarettes daily  and drinks socially. He has a BMI of 29 and has been recently diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).   Past Medical History  Mr. Roberts had been previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension 10 years ago but has been non-compliant with medications citing forgetfulness and lack of knowledge about the seriousness of their implications. He has also been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and has a history of ischemic heart disease  which was managed with coronary artery bypass graft surgery 5 years ago. There were no reported complications after the surgery  and he had been on regular follow-ups.   Family history  There is a strong family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father dying at an early age due to myocardial infarction  and his older sister currently managing peripheral artery disease (PAD). Additionally  his mother has type 2 diabetes and hypertension.   Presenting complaint  Mr. Roberts reports having severe pain in his right lower limb  especially upon exertion and at night  for the past three months. He experienced significant weight loss and has wound ulcers that are not healing  raising concerns about his quality of life and heightened risk of lower extremity amputation.   On assessment  his lower right foot is cold to the touch with visible skin color changes showing pallor and cyanosis. The pulses in his right leg are weak and no audible doppler signal is present at the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries indicating severe blood flow compromise.   Laboratory findings reveal elevated blood glucose and lipid levels. An angiogram shows severe obstruction in the superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery in the right leg. These clinical findings have led to a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia  which justifies his clinical symptoms of debilitating pain in his right leg and non-healing ulcers.   This case warrants urgent medical attention due to the severe nature of CLI  the objective is to salvage the limb  manage the pain  and slow the disease progression. The management plan for Mr. Roberts will be multifaceted  including aggressive control of his diabetes and hyperlipidemia  smoking cessation  wound care  pain management  potential angioplasty or bypass surgery  and lifestyle modifications. Regular psychological and social support will also be offered due to the high stress and anxiety level associated with this illness.

Patient also reported skin discoloration  feeling of coldness in the leg  and difficulty in walking.  History of Present Illness: The patient's leg pain initially started around 20 days back  minimum at rest but gradually increased in severity. The pain has been restricting his daily activities. Over the past week  he noticed changes in the skin color of his foot.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes for 15 years  hypertension for ten years  and high cholesterol levels for six years. He had a smoking history of 20 cigarettes a day but quit 15 years ago.  Medications:  The patient is on oral hypoglycemic drugs  ACE inhibitors  and statins.  Family History: There is a family history of heart disease. His father had an early myocardial infarction at the age of 55 and his older brother was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease at 60.  Physical Examination: On examination  the left leg was cooler compared to the right one  with a weak pulse and skin pallor noted. There was a non-healing ulcer over the left heel adding further concern to the potential severity of his condition. No signs of gangrene noted. The ankle-brachial index was 0.6 indicating severe peripheral artery disease.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Detailed arterial Duplex ultrasound examination revealed significant stenosis of the left external iliac artery. Resting ankle brachial index (ABI) was 0.4 in the left leg and 0.9 at the right leg.   Mr. A was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI) due to significant stenosis of the left external iliac artery  secondary to long-standing poorly controlled diabetes  and a strong family history of vascular disorders.  Management: The initial management plan for Mr. A is divided into reachable goals which are: pain control  improving limb perfusion to prevent amputation  and lifestyle modifications.  Patient had undergone endovascular revascularization for his left lower limb  and pain management is achieved using opioids. He will be referred to rehabilitation to improve muscle function and physical capacity after revascularization.  Regarding lifestyle modification  it will include regular checkups for blood glucose levels  lipid profile  blood pressure along with dietary changes  and an exercise plan.  This case highlights the importance of early detection and prompt management of PAD. High-risk patients with a history of diabetes and smokers should be the target of such interventions.

An urgent peripheral artery angioplasty and stent placement were advised  followed by serial non-invasive vascular studies to monitor the flow in the right leg. Due to his uncontrolled diabetes  adjustments to his medication regime were suggested  along with dietary changes and a podiatry review to prevent future foot infections.   This case highlights the importance of early detection and management of risk factors like diabetes and hypertension  which can significantly delay CLI progression and decrease the need for intervention. Nevertheless  this patient’s continuing care will require a multidisciplinary approach involving primary care  vascular medicine  endocrinology  dietetics  and psychiatry services for comprehensive management.
7,9,56,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial56,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Fitz  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presents with a chief complaint of pain in his lower limbs  particularly his left leg. The pain has been constant and severe over the past three to four weeks  leading to a significant decrease in his quality of life. He reports the pain to be exacerbated by physical activity and somewhat relieved by rest  but mentions that it has started to persist even at rest. He also reports non-healing ulcers on his left foot.  Past medical history is significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which he has been managing for the past 15 years with oral medications. He was also diagnosed with high blood pressure about 10 years ago. He has a 40-year history of smoking  approximately a pack a day  and admits to moderate alcohol consumption but denied illicit drug use.   His family history is significant; both his father and paternal grandfather had heart disease and his mother had a stroke.   On physical examination  his left leg appears pale when raised and reddish-blue upon dependency. The leg is cooler to the touch compared to the other one. Pulses on the left leg are faint and there are non-healing ulcers around his left ankle and foot. An Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) is conducted  demonstrating a low ABI of 0.4 in his left leg and 0.9 in his right leg.   Further diagnostic investigations included a Doppler ultrasound  which confirmed severe blood flow reduction in the left leg  specifically around the area of his left popliteal artery.   Mr. Fitz was subsequently diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  likely secondary to peripheral artery disease (PAD) which itself appears to be related to his longstanding history of uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and smoking.  Current treatment includes pain management with analgesic medication  rigorous wound care  and he was commenced on antiplatelet and statin therapy to manage his PAD. Interventional options  inclusive of angioplasty  stenting  or bypass surgery  are being considered and discussed with the patient.   We counseled Mr. Fitz on the importance of strict blood sugar and pressure control and advised him to quit smoking to prevent the progression of CLI and PAD  and other potential complications like heart disease and stroke. We've also referred him to a dietician to help create a diet plan that is heart-healthy and good for his diabetes.   This case underscores the significant impact of non-communicable diseases and health behaviors on underlying vascular issues. Timely diagnosis and management of CLI is essential to avoid complications such as amputation and mortality.

He has two elder brothers  one of them has coronary artery disease (CAD) and the other brother has hypertension and diabetes.  Current Medications:  Atenolol 50mg  once daily for HTN; Glipizide 10mg  once daily and Metformin 500mg twice daily for DM; Simvastatin 20mg  once daily for dyslipidemia.  Clinical Examination:   On physical examination  the patient had an unhealed toe ulcer  noticeable pallor  diminished pulse in the right lower limb indicative of impaired circulation. The Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) for the right leg was 0.48 indicative of severe perfusion deficit.  Diagnosis:  Based upon the history  examination findings  and ABI result  the patient was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia.  Plan:  The patient was immediately referred to a vascular surgeon for further treatment  including angioplasty  stent placement  or bypass surgery  depending on the severity and extent of the vascular blockage. Meanwhile  DM  HTN  and dyslipidemia are to be properly managed in coordination with his primary care physician. Strict glycemic control would be ensured to bring Glipizide and Metformin doses to target levels. The patient was counseled on lifestyle modification  including a strict no-smoking policy  maintaining an active lifestyle  and adhering to a fixed diet plan ideal for a diabetic and hypertensive patient. Regular follow-up appointments are recommended.
7,9,70,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial70,Patient Information:   A 65-year-old male patient  of Asian descent  with a residence in downtown Boston presented with worsening pain in his lower limbs for the last six months. He also reported some loss of weight  fatigue  and poor appetite over the same period. The patient lives alone  has a sedentary lifestyle  and a 30-year history of cigarette smoking around a half pack/day. He does not consume alcohol and has no known drug allergies. He retired as a school teacher five years ago.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a known medical history of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes mellitus. Both were diagnosed 15 years ago and are on medication (Metformin for diabetes and Ramipril for hypertension).   Family History:   His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 70  while his mother died of stroke complications at 68. He has one sibling  a younger sister who has hypercholesterolemia.   Present Complaint:  He started experiencing dull aching pain in his right lower leg about six months ago. The pain became constant and was aggravated on walking even short distances (claudication) to the point that he required rest to relieve it. Over the last month  he also started experiencing discomfort in his left lower leg and developed a non-healing sore on the right big toe. He denies any trauma to the site. He also shared that he often feels his feet being cold to touch  and has noticed discoloration in his foot areas.   Physical Examination:  Upon examination  peripheral pulses (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial) were difficult to palpate on both lower limbs. There was a noticeable pallor in both feet  more pronounced in the right one which had a non-healing ulcer over the big toe. His body mass index was 26  and blood pressure was elevated at 145/100 mmHg.   Investigations:  Lab reports showed elevated fasting blood glucose  HbA1c  and lipid profile (LDL  total cholesterol). His cardiac enzymes  including troponin I level were normal. An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test indicated diminished peripheral circulation. Color Doppler Ultrasound of lower limb arteries revealed significant stenosis in both right and left posterior tibial arteries and right anterior tibial artery.   Diagnosis:  Based on the findings  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia was made  and the patient was advised for urgent vascular consultation for possible intervention to restore circulation.  This case reflects the typical sequelae of risk factors such as history of smoking  uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and high cholesterol which often leads to end-stage peripheral artery disease like Critical Limb Ischemia. Critical Limb Ischemia is a severe obstruction of the arteries resulting in significantly reduced blood flow to the limbs. It is a serious condition  associated with poor prognosis and high rates of morbidity and mortality.   Follow-up / Plan of Care:  The patient was referred to vascular surgery for potential endovascular therapy or bypass surgery. He was advised to continue with his medications  and control his modifiable risk factors like smoking  diet  exercise  and regular monitoring of blood sugar and blood pressure. The importance of foot care was stressed upon him. He is scheduled for a follow-up after a week to chart the progress and see if further interventions are required in his management plan.
7,9,71,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial71,Case Presentation: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Confidentiality Reference: Patient X  Patient Background:  Patient X is a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a history of poorly managed type 2 diabetes mellitus for thirty years. He has been reportedly non-compliant with the administration of insulin and only sporadically adheres to the recommended dietary adjustments. The patient also has a history of smoking (1 pack/day for 45 years) and heavy alcohol consumption  which he quit five years ago. Furthermore  the patient suffers from hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which he has been controlling with antihypertensives and statins  respectively.   Demographic Details and Family History:  Patient X is a retired factory worker  divorced  with two children  and currently lives alone in urban New Jersey. His father died of stroke in his early sixties  and his mother succumbed to breast cancer. His 75-year-old brother has coronary artery disease and is a long-term diabetes sufferer as well  but manages his health more carefully.  Onset of Presenting Complaints:  His current issues began approximately four months ago when he noticed intermittent pain in his right lower leg  particularly while walking - a symptom known as claudication. Recently  the pain has considerably worsened and is now present even at rest.   Clinical Examination: Physical examination revealed an absence of pulses in the right tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. The right lower leg was cold to touch  with noticeable skin discoloration and the presence of superficial ulcers on the toes. His left leg was largely asymptomatic  and arterial flow was normal on Doppler ultrasound.   Diagnostic Tests and Results: After conducting an ankle-brachial index (ABI)  which presented values less than 0.4 and a transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) assessment that also showed abnormal results  the patient was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI) in the right lower limb.   Plan: The critical stage of his illness is requiring a comprehensive interprofessional approach to his health needs. We plan to consult with a vascular surgeon for possible revascularization procedures  a dietitian  a diabetes educator  and a social worker to address his diabetes mismanagement  and a podiatrist for wound management. Patient X will require regular follow-ups with his primary care physician over a prolonged period to monitor his diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Treatment plans will necessitate significant changes to their lifestyle and strict compliance to prescribed therapies.   This case emphasizes the importance of managing chronic diseases and adhering to treatments as the patient's non-compliance with his diabetes management escalated a possibly preventable condition to a critical state.
7,9,72,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial72,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old African American male who has been diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI). He hails from Brooklyn  New York  and lives with his wife. He worked as a construction engineer and has been retired for 10 years.   Medical History:  His past medical history is significant for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus for over 15 years  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. Mr. Smith had previously undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery eight years ago due to ischemic heart disease. His diabetes is associated with peripheral neuropathy  retinopathy  and nephropathy. He is a former smoker with 30 pack-years of smoking but quit after his CABG surgery.   Presenting symptoms:  Mr. Smith presented to the clinic with intense rest pain in his right lower leg that has been going on for several weeks. He also reports non-healing wounds on his right foot and slight skin discoloration. On examination  his right foot appeared pale and cold to touch  with poor capillary refill. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were not palpable.   Family History:  Mr. Smith's family history of cardiovascular disease is significant with his father having a heart attack at 54  and his elder brother has undergone angioplasty for symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD). His mother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. There is no history of stroke or aneurysm in the family.   Social History:  Mr. Smith is a teetotaller and does not indulge in any substance abuse. His diet mainly contains calorically dense foods with limited intake of fruits and vegetables. Physical activity is minimal. His BMI is 30 and falls under the obese category.  Past and Present Medications:  Mr. Smith has been taking Metformin 500mg twice daily for his diabetes along with Lisinopril 20mg once daily for his hypertension  and Atorvastatin 40mg once daily for his hyperlipidemia. Aspirin 81mg for secondary prevention of heart disease is also part of his medication regimen.  Diagnostic Work-Up:  An Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was performed which revealed an index of 0.3 indicating severe obstruction. Doppler ultrasound imaging revealed significant narrowing of the distal right popliteal artery and absence of flow in the anterior tibial  posterior tibial  and peroneal arteries. Hence  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia was made.  Plan:  The severity of his condition requires urgent intervention. Multidisciplinary care involving a vascular surgeon  endocrinologist  dietitian  podiatrist  and a physical therapist should be put in place. Mr. Smith needs angiography for further assessment followed by revascularization procedure. He needs aggressive management of his blood glucose levels  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  along with dietary modifications  smoking cessation counseling  and regular exercise to improve his overall prognosis.  Informed consent for angiography and possible vascular intervention should be obtained  while also educating the patient on the urgency and benefits of the procedure. Mr. Smith should be prepared for lifestyle modifications and informed of the need for regular follow-ups post intervention. 
7,9,73,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial73,Patient Profile:  Mr. X  a 72-year-old male  retired mechanic  presented to the outpatient department with complaints of severe pain in his left lower limb  particularly in the foot region for the past month. He also reported experiencing intermittent claudication  or pain during walking that relieved with rest. On further questioning  he disclosed that the discomfort was significantly worse during the night  often disturbing his sleep. He mentioned a recent difficulty in healing a small cut on his foot. He resides with his wife in a suburban setting and is a father of two adult sons.  Medical History: The patient has a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes  which is managed with oral hypoglycemics and diet control. He also suffers from hypertension for the past ten years  managed with medication. He is a nonsmoker  moderate alcohol drinker (3-4 drinks weekly for about 30 years)  and denies any illicit drug use. He has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia  managed with statins.   Family History: Mr. X's father passed away at 85 due to a stroke. His mother died of congestive heart failure at the age of 90. His eldest brother has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting at 70.   Physical Examination: On examination  his left foot was found to be cold with pallor and delayed capillary refill time (>3 seconds). The foot had a small non-healing ulcer with necrotic edges on the plantar surface. Pulses in the left foot were weakly palpable. No signs of deep vein thrombosis were detected.   Investigations: Peripheral arterial Doppler ultrasonography showed significantly reduced blood flow at the level of the left popliteal artery  with an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.4  indicative of severe ischemia. Blood tests indicated poor glycemic control (HbA1c of 9.0%) and elevated LDL cholesterol level.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical scenario and investigation findings  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) was made.  Disposition: The patient's risk factors like uncontrolled DM  HTN  and hyperlipidemia were addressed. Glycemic control was optimized by adjusting diabetes management  BP control was emphasized  and the statin dosage was increased. He was recommended for smoking cessation and a healthier diet. A vascular surgery consultation was obtained for possible revascularization procedures like angioplasty  stent  or bypass surgery. Multidisciplinary teams involving vascular surgeons  diabetologists  and wound care nurses were engaged for a comprehensive treatment approach.
7,9,74,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial74,PRESENTATION OF THE PATIENT:   Mr. Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  came to the hospital with complaints of severe rest pain in his left lower leg for the past three weeks  making it difficult for him to walk or perform any physical activity. He also mentioned the presence of non-healing ulcers on his left foot.   PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Mr. Smith has a known medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 20 years  managed with Metformin and Insulin  and Hypertension for 10 years  which is being managed with Lisinopril. He also has dyslipidemia and is on Atorvastatin. He was diagnosed with Renal Insufficiency 2 years ago but has not required dialysis yet. Furthermore  he quit smoking 15 years ago after having been a 1-pack/day smoker for 30 years but continues to consume alcohol moderately.  FAMILY HISTORY:   His father died from a heart attack at the age of 75  his mother is alive and suffers from osteoarthritis  and his brother had a stroke at 62. This throws light on the genetic predisposition Mr. Smith could possibly have toward cardiovascular diseases.  CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  1. Metformin for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  2. Insulin Pen for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  3. Lisinopril for Hypertension  4. Atorvastatin for Dyslipidemia   RELEVANT INFORMATION:  Investigations reveal a significantly diminished left pedal pulse with Doppler studies showing severely reduced blood flow in the left leg  while the right leg appears normal. Additional imaging  including digital subtraction angiography  reveals critical limb ischemia of his left leg and foot  due to occlusion of the distal portion of the left SFA and entire popliteal artery. A diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is established.  Considering Mr. Smith's existing comorbidities and the severity of his CLI  it is crucial to assess him for potential revascularization. Upon discussing the prognosis and treatment options  Mr. Smith expressed his willingness to proceed with any procedure that could potentially save his leg and improve his quality of life. He understands that without proper intervention  the possibility of amputation is high. In this case  we highly recommend consultation with the vascular surgery team for further management.  Mr. Smith has been advised to regularly check his blood sugar level  maintain a healthy diet  and moderate physical activity as it permits to help manage his diabetes better. He has also been advised to abstain from alcohol. His family has been urged to monitor his health closely and encourage compliance with medication and lifestyle changes. He agrees to adhere to the management plan and schedules follow-up appointments to monitor his progress.
7,9,75,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial75,Patient Introduction: Mr. James Schmidt  a 65-year-old male  presented to the emergency department with severe rest pain in the left lower limb  which had been worsening over the past two weeks. An examination revealed coldness  coloring changes  and numbness. Mr. Schmidt resides in Brooklyn with his wife and has been a retired plumber for the past five years. He's a heavy smoker with a 45-year-pack history.   Past Medical History: Mr. Schmidt was diagnosed with type II diabetes approximately fifteen years ago  for which he takes oral anti-diabetic medications regularly. He had an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) six years ago  followed by successful stent placement in the left anterior descending coronary artery. He has been under medication for hyperlipidemia and hypertension for about ten years.  Family History: His father died of massive myocardial infarction at the age of 58  and his mother is alive and well at 85. His elder brother was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) at 60.  Clinical Examination: On examination  his BMI was calculated to be 30.5  and his blood pressure was 155/90 mm of Hg. The left lower limb was notably cooler than the right  with weak femoral and popliteal pulsations and an absence of distal pulses. The ankle-brachial index was 0.4  revealing severe limb ischemia.  Investigations: Lab investigations revealed HbA1c- 8.2%  indicating suboptimal control of diabetes. Electrocardiography  while at rest  was unremarkable. Three sets of angiograms revealed the left superficial femoral artery and distal vessels were profoundly diseased.  Diagnosis: Based on history  clinical presentation  and radiographic finding  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) secondary to atherosclerosis of the lower limb vessels was made.  Care Plan: An immediate referral to a vascular surgeon was arranged for possible peripheral revascularization  and a multidisciplinary team meeting was scheduled. The patient was retained under observation due to severe rest pain. His cardiovascular medications were thoroughly reviewed  and a plan was made to optimize his diabetes control and hypertension.  Preventive measures  such as smoking cessation  weight reduction  and control of lipid profile  were stressed upon. The patient was referred for physiotherapy after the proper treatment of CLI. Regular follow-ups for wound care and further management were planned.  This case highlights the importance of early detection and aggressive treatment of peripheral artery disease  especially in high-risk patients such as those with diabetes and a strong family history of cardiovascular disease. Public health initiatives to encourage smoking cessation  routine exercise  and healthy dietary habits will be a valuable addition in controlling the prevalence of these high-risk diseases.

7,9,77,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial77,Patient Presentation:   Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 62 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Location: Colorado Springs  Colorado  Mr. Johnson  a 62-year-old male  has presented with severe pain in his right lower limb. The pain persists even during rest and occasionally  he feels burning or prickling sensations. The patient reports a few instances of non-healing ulcers on his right foot as well.  His past medical history includes: 1. 18 years of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  which has been fairly controlled with insulin therapy.  2. Hypertension for the past 10 years  managed with antihypertensive medications.  3. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 5 years ago due to significant heart disease.  He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking  though he quit smoking right after his bypass surgery five years ago. Mr. Johnson admits to occasional alcohol consumption but denies any illicit drug use.  In terms of his family history: 1. His father died in his early sixties due to myocardial infarction 2. His mother died in her late seventies and had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.  3. Both his older brother and sister are managing Type II Diabetes and Hypertension.  Examination reveals an absent pulse in his right popliteal  anterior tibial  and dorsalis pedis. His right foot is pale in comparison to the left one and shows signs of atrophy and hair loss.  Based on his symptoms  physical examination  and past medical history  Mr. Johnson has been diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI) of his right lower extremity. CLI is a severe obstruction of the arteries which drastically reduces blood flow to the extremities and has progressed to the point of severe pain and even skin ulcers or sores.  In order to plan further management  we're considering an angiogram to define better the extent and location of arterial disease. Our primary concern is saving Mr. Johnson's right leg  thus surgical or endovascular interventions like angioplasty  bypass grafting  or stent placement may be on the cards depending on angiogram results. Also  pain management  wound care  and aggressive risk-factor modification  including strict diabetic control  will be part of his treatment plan.
7,9,78,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial78,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Richard Cooper is a 72-year-old African-American male  retired mechanic  referred to vascular surgery for critical limb ischemia diagnosed two weeks ago. He presents with increased complaints of rest pain  severe enough to wake him up at night. He has noticed non-healing ulcers on his left foot with no notable trauma or infection. He also reports intermittent claudication that is affecting his mobility and quality of life.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Cooper is obese with a BMI of 33. He has an extensive past medical history  including type II diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years  hypertension  dyslipidemia  and a 50-pack-year smoking history  but he has been tobacco-free for the last 10 years. He has a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but no history of cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease.  Examination:  On clinical examination  he has weak pulses in left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. There are non-healing ulcers noted on the digits of his left foot. His right leg's peripheral pulses are preserved. No signs of infection were found.  Demographics and Family History:  Mr. Cooper currently lives in a suburban neighborhood with his wife of fifty years. He finished high school and worked as a mechanic in the military. He denies alcohol use but reports quitting smoking ten years ago after the diagnosis of COPD. His father died of a stroke aged 67 and his mother at 79 of unknown cause but had diabetes and hypertension. He has five siblings  two of whom have Type II diabetes and one who had a below-knee amputation due to peripheral artery disease.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is 0.4 on the left side and 0.9 on the right side. Angiogram reveals severe multilevel peripheral artery disease (PAD)  especially in the left lower extremity. The patient is diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) based on the clinical presentation  non-invasive study findings  and angiogram.  Plan:  The goals of intervention for Mr. Cooper are pain relief  wound healing  prevention of limb loss  and improving his quality of life. Given his diagnosis of CLI  revascularization is the most appropriate initial treatment. He will require optimal medical therapy  including antiplatelet therapy  statin therapy  antihypertensive therapy  glycemic control  and smoking cessation  which he has already achieved.   Further  wound care consultation for his foot ulcers  dietary consultation for weight loss  and diabetic education for better diabetes control is also recommended. Cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation and closely supervised exercise programs can be beneficial to improve functional status and quality of life. Regular follow-up reviews are also needed for monitoring disease progression and potential complications.   This comprehensive approach should significantly improve Mr. Cooper's CLI prognosis  and prevent amputation of the limb.
7,9,79,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial79,Patient Background:   Mr. A. is a 67-year-old Caucasian male admitted to the vascular surgery department with severe pain in his right lower leg during rest  especially at night. He stated that the pain has been persistent for the past few weeks and has been interrupted by his sleep  which directly led to his loss of productivity and overall quality of life.   Medical History:  Mr. A. has chronic heart disease (CHD)  for which he has been receiving treatment for over a decade. His other comorbidities include type 2 diabetes mellitus that has been managed with oral hypoglycemic agents and diet control for 15 years  as well as stage 2 hypertension that has been maintained with antihypertensive medications for around five years.   The decline in his lower extremity health started around one year ago  with intermittent claudication and slowly progressive distal necrosis on his right foot. Recent progression of ischemic rest pain led the primary care physician to refer the patient to the vascular surgery department.   Family History:  There is a significant family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 65  and his older sister was diagnosed with CHD at the age of 56. Additionally  both his parents had type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Presenting Complaints:  On admission  the patient complained of severe rest pain in the right lower leg  particularly at the toes region. The pain has been increasing in intensity  particularly at night  and is relieved to a certain extent only on hanging the leg at the side of the bed. Skin discoloration  inconsistent and weak pedal pulses  and decreased sensation in the right lower limb were noted. Moderate non-healing ulcers were observed on his right heel and first toe.  Lab Investigations/Diagnostic Tools:  Lab investigations revealed uncontrolled Diabetes (HbA1C 8.5%) and high LDL levels (140 mg/dL). Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was diminished  0.4 on the right side. A Doppler ultrasound showed significant stenosis in the distal part of the right lower extremity.  Based on the clinical picture and diagnostic results  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made.  Management Plan:  Initial management includes analgesia and attempts for swift revascularization. The patient is scheduled for angioplasty  but optimal diabetes and hypertension control is a mandatory step pre-operation. A diabetic foot care specialist has been looped in to manage the non-healing ulcers  and diet modification is advised to manage his LDL levels.  Conclusion:  Critical Limb Ischemia is a severe stage of peripheral artery disease  that often presents as severe rest pain  non-healing ulcers  or gangrene. It is often associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  and dyslipidemia  which were present in this patient. Early recognition and appropriate management are crucial to prevent limb-loss to maintain the patient's quality of life. The ultimate aim is to achieve maximal limb salvage and improve quality of life.
7,9,80,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial80,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Johnson is a 72-year-old African American male  hailing from Seattle  Washington. He has been diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI). His presenting symptoms include severe pain in his left foot at rest  non-healing wounds on his toes  and significant difficulty walking short distances due to pain.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a longstanding history of poorly managed type 2 diabetes  diagnosed twenty years ago  and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) that has been worsening progressively for the last five years. He also has a history of hypertension and was previously a heavy smoker  but quit smoking ten years ago.   Family History:  Mr. Johnson's family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases. His father passed away with a myocardial infarction at the age of 67  and his older sister was diagnosed with early-onset coronary artery disease at the age of 55. He also has a younger brother who is living with type 2 diabetes.  Social History:  Mr. Johnson is a retired truck driver  living with his spouse in a suburban setting. He admitted to smoking two packs of cigarettes per day over a 35-year period but quit smoking ten years ago. He denies regular alcohol consumption and has an inactive  sedentary lifestyle due to difficulty walking caused by pain. He has three children and six grandchildren and is a widower.  Current Medications and Allergies:  He is currently on Lisinopril for hypertension  and Metformin for diabetes. He has an allergy to Penicillin  presenting as a rash.   Physical Examination:  Clinical examination reveals absent pulses in the left pedal region and an ulcer on the plantar surface of the left foot which is poorly healing  displaying features of chronic ischemia. Furthermore  symptoms of rest pain and claudication further point towards CLI.  Plan:  The plan for Mr. Johnson includes aggressive limb salvage strategies due to the severity of his CLI. This would include initial imaging studies  such as an angiogram  to evaluate the vascular patency and decide on revascularization procedures like angioplasty  bypass surgery  or possibly endovascular techniques. Further examinations to assess wound healing and prevent amputation may be needed.   Mr. Johnson will also need aggressive management of his comorbidities  including stricter glycemic control for his diabetes and better hypertension management. Lifestyle counseling about diet and exercise would also be beneficial. More frequent follow-ups will ensure progress monitoring and necessary adjustments in his treatment regimen.
7,9,81,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial81,Patient Profile:   Mr. Thomas is a 73-year-old Caucasian male  residing in the rural area of Lincoln  Nebraska. He is a retired post-office worker  and currently leads a sedentary lifestyle. He is a known case of Type II diabetes mellitus for the past 12 years  takes oral anti-diabetic medication  and his diabetes is generally well-controlled. He also has a diagnosis for Stage II Chronic Kidney Disease. Mr. Thomas is an ex-smoker  having quit 10 years ago but had a 30 pack-year smoking history. He is married  does occasional gardening which constitutes his minimal physical activity  and lives with his wife of 50 years.   Presenting Complaint:   Mr. Thomas presents to the clinic with chronic  worsening pain in his left lower limb  especially in the calf muscle. He mentions the pain has increasingly affected his sleep over the last month and worsens after mild activity  like walking about 100 meters (Intermittent Claudication). He also complains of ulcers on his left foot that have not been healing for a few weeks now.  Clinical Examination:   Upon physical examination  one can observe non-healing ulcers on his left foot (Gangrene not yet evident). His left leg appears to be paler as compared to his right  particularly when elevated. Pulses on the popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and post-tibial artery are not palpable in the left leg. Pedal skin is also colder on touch in his left leg compared to the right.  Investigations and Diagnosis:   Lower extremity arterial Doppler revealed greater than 50% stenoses in his left femoral and popliteal arteries. His ankle-brachial index (ABI) is below 0.4 in his left leg. Given these findings coupled with the history and examination  Mr. Thomas has been diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) of the left leg.  Family History:   Mr. Thomas's father died at 65  potentially due to a cardiac event  while his mother died at 77 after suffering from dementia. He has two brothers  both of whom are living and well but have a history of diabetes. There is no known familial history of peripheral arterial disease.  Complications and Comorbidities:   Mr. Thomas' diabetes  CKD  and history of smoking place him at high risk for atherosclerosis  potentially contributing to his current condition. If not treated appropriately  CLI could potentially lead to amputation of the affected limb.  Management:   Mr. Thomas has been referred to a vascular specialist. While waiting for his consultation  he has been advised to elevate his leg  avoid crossing his legs  and use a wheelchair for mobility to minimize limb use. His medications have been revised to include aspirin  statins  and ACE inhibitors considering his risk factors and current diagnosis of CLI.
7,9,82,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial82,Case Presentation:  Patient Presentation: Our patient  Mr. A  is a 70-year-old Caucasian male  presenting with chronic  non-healing wounds on his right lower extremity. He reports experiencing persistent rest pain in his right foot  particularly at night. His pain is described as sharp  constant  and worsens when the leg is elevated. He also complains of numbness and a tingling sensation in the same foot.  Past Medical History: Mr. A has a 10-year history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He was diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago  and it is controlled with Lisinopril. Due to his medical history  he has a long-standing history of dyslipidemia and a 30-pack year history of smoking  but quit smoking about 6 months ago. His BMI is 28  confirming that he is overweight. He has no known drug allergies.  Family History: His father died at the age of 72 from congestive heart failure  and his mother has a history of Hypertension. He also has a brother who was diagnosed with Peripheral Artery Disease at the age of 66.  Physical Examination: Clinical examination revealed pallor  coolness to the touch  and diminished pulses in the right foot. Ulceration and necrosis were noted on his right foot  particularly at the toes. No apparent signs of infection were present at wound sites.  Diagnostic Evaluation: Angiography revealed significant arterial blockages in his right lower extremity. His ankle-brachial index was significantly reduced  indicative of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Additional tests  including a duplex ultrasound and CT angiography  confirmed the diagnosis.  Discussion: Mr. A's past medical history of Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension combined with his history of smoking and dyslipidemia put him at high risk for developing vascular diseases like Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). CLI is a severe obstructive peripheral arterial disease where blood supply to the lower extremities is critically reduced causing severe pain  non-healing sores  and potentially can lead to amputation if left untreated.  Treatment Plan: Mr. A was started on an aggressive treatment plan including anticoagulation and lipid-lowering therapy. A vascular surgeon was consulted  and a revascularization procedure  whether endovascular or surgical  was discussed. The patient was educated about the importance of tight blood glucose and blood pressure control  diet  exercise  and smoking cessation. He was also referred to a diabetic foot care program.  Follow-Up: Mr. A will be closely monitored over the coming weeks and months to monitor his response to the treatment. Surgical intervention or revascularization procedures may be necessary if the conservative treatment fails to improve his condition.   Ethical Considerations: Mr. A’s treatment will be executed ensuring absolute privacy  dignity  and consent. His care plan includes shared decision-making  respecting his autonomy  and fostering clear communication between him  his family  and the healthcare team. His mental health will also be constantly reviewed and acted upon due to the high-stress nature of his diagnosis.
7,9,83,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial83,Patient Presentation  Patient Profile: Mr. Carlos Hernandez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male residing in Corpus Christi  Texas. He is a retired steelworker and is now leading a sedentary lifestyle. Mr. Hernandez is a widower who lives with his adult daughter. As a lifelong smoker  he has consumed 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. His diet typically includes high-fat foods  which has subsequently led to obesity with a BMI of 32.5 kg/m2.  Presenting Illness:  Mr. Hernandez presented to the hospital with severe pain in his lower left leg that started three weeks ago. He describes the pain as aching and persistent  even while resting. Additionally  he complained of persistent foot ulcers that did not respond to any over-the-counter medicines.  Personal Medical History:  Mr. Hernandez suffers from chronic illnesses  including type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 10 years ago  hypertension  and a past history of myocardial infarction five years prior to this admission. His regular medicines include Metformin  Lisinopril  and Aspirin.   Family History:  Both his parents died in their late 60s  the father from myocardial infarction and the mother from stroke. His younger sister was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. There is no family history of cancer.  Diagnosis  Investigations & Findings: The ankle-brachial index was performed which revealed a reading below 0.4 (indicating critical limb ischemia) in the left leg. Duplex ultrasound was then conducted  confirming two significant stenoses in the patient's left leg. Severe calcification in the arteries was also noted  which is consistent with diabetes mellitus and long-standing smoking habit.  Management Plan: The vascular surgery team decided to perform an endovascular revascularization. Given the patient's multiple co-morbidities and advanced age  this less invasive option was chosen with an aim to relieve his pain  heal the ulcers  prevent limb loss  and improve his quality of life.  Healthcare team members from cardiology  endocrinology  and nutrition are also involved in managing his cardiovascular health  diabetes  and obesity respectively. A smoking cessation program has been recommended.   Conclusion: This case of Mr. Hernandez underscores the importance of early diagnosis and aggressive management of modifiable risk factors such as smoking  obesity  and diabetes in cases of critical limb ischemia to prevent detrimental outcomes like amputation and increase the quality of life.
7,9,84,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial84,Patient Presentation:   Patient Initial: Mr. G    Age: 68 years old  Sex: Male   Race: Caucasian   Occupation: Retired accountant   Presenting Complaint: Severe pain in his left leg that intensified over past few weeks.   Medical History: Mr. G has a history of Type II diabetes diagnosed 15 years ago  managed by oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has hypertension under control through medication for the past 10 years. The patient is a former smoker  having quit smoking five years ago after smoking a packet per day for close to 30 years. There is no known history of allergies.   Family History: Both his parents died in their mid-seventies. His father had a fatal myocardial infarction  and his mother had documented coronary artery disease before dying after a stroke. His elder sister who is 70 lives with Type II diabetes and hypertension.  Examination & Diagnosis: Upon examination  Mr. G had a lower left leg ulcer surrounded by discoloration and foot pallor. The pulse in the left pedal was poorly felt  and a weak popliteal pulse accompanied by severe pain when the limb was raised. Based on these findings and severity of pain  Doppler ultrasound was done to confirm the suspicion which revealed severe reduction in blood flow to the lower part of his left limb. Further angiographic examination confirmed multi-segment disease with significant stenosis. Diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia was made.  Treatment & Management:   As per guidelines  Mr. G had been recommended for revascularization. Post-revascularization  he has been planned for multidisciplinary wound care for the leg ulcer. Pharmacologic therapy includes antiplatelet drugs for preventing complications and statins for managing any associated dyslipidemia. His diabetes and hypertension will be more strictly controlled concerning his new diagnosis.  Prognosis: Owing to the age  diabetes  and diagnosis of severe Critical Limb Ischemia  the prognosis would be guarded and highly dependent on his response to revascularization  wound management  and adherence to medications. Regular follow-ups would be planned to monitor the same.   Patient Education: Mr. G has been counseled about the need for strict glucose and blood pressure control  importance of foot care  wound management  adherence to medication  and healthy lifestyle habits.
7,9,85,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial85,Patient Profile: Name: John Doe Age: 65 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Electrician Location: New York  USA  Chief Complaint:  The patient complains of severe pain in his right leg that increases during the night. He also notes ulcers or sores in the same leg that are slow in healing  indicating possible poor blood circulation.  Medical History:  The patient has an underlying condition of Type II Diabetes which has been poorly managed over the past 10 years. He has been a smoker for over 40 years  which has led to hypertension and high cholesterol levels. In 2005  he was diagnosed with coronary artery disease resulting in a CABG procedure the same year.  Family History:  His mother died of a myocardial infarction at 73  and his father had passed away due to a stroke at the age of 80. The patient also has one brother who has been recently diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  Physical Examination: Upon examination  the right foot presents with coolness compared to the left and distinct signs of atrophy of the skin. Pulses are weak distally. There is a small ulcer on the big toe.  Investigations: An ankle-brachial index (ABI) test showed that the patient's ratio is significantly decreased  indicating blockage or narrowing of the arteries in the leg.  Diagnosis: Given these symptoms and the results of the ABI test  John Doe has been diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Treatment Plan: The treatment focuses on risk factor modification  exercise regimen  and possible intervention by angioplasty or vascular surgery to increase blood flow to the affected leg. The patient must stop smoking. Strict control of his blood glucose  blood pressure  and cholesterol levels will be necessary to prevent further arterial damage.  John's condition needs to be monitored closely as CLI increases the chance of heart attack  stroke  and amputation. This treatment plan will require a multidisciplinary team that includes his primary care physician  a vascular surgeon  a podiatrist  a dietician  and a diabetes educator.  Prognosis: The progression of CLI can be slowed down with suitable treatment and lifestyle changes  but the overall prognosis will largely depend on how well the patient can manage his co-existing pathologies  especially his diabetes and smoking habits.
7,9,86,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial86,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith is a 73-year-old white male with a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He was brought into the emergency department with symptoms of severe pain in both his lower limbs. This pain has been persisting at rest and often deprives him of sleep. On examination  the limbs were notably pale with weak to absent peripheral pulses. Doppler ultrasound confirmed lower blood flow in his limbs.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a significant medical history of type-2 diabetes and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). He also has high blood pressure and hyperlipidemia and has been a chronic smoker for around 50 years. His diabetes has been generally poorly controlled over the years  leading to the development of PAD and eventually CLI. He also has a 10-year history of coronary artery disease and had angioplasty done twice in the past.  Family History:  Mr. Smith's father died young at the age of 67 due to congestive heart failure and his mother passed away from a stroke when she was 82. His eldest brother has type-2 diabetes and a personal history of myocardial infarction. There is also a huge family history of smoking on both sides.  Social History:  John Smith is a retired truck driver and currently lives with his wife in rural Alabama. He has two children  both living out of state. His lifestyle has been largely sedentary since retiring. He has been a chronic smoker since he was 23 years old  smoking a packet a day. He denies alcohol use.  Conclusion/Discussion:  Mr. Smith's CLI custody is severe and is worrying considering his medical and family history. His history of poorly controlled diabetes  PAD  chronic smoking  and coronary artery disease makes him at high risk for cardiovascular events and limb loss. He is presently under discussion for revascularization pending additional assessment of anatomical involvement and comorbid conditions.  Prompt and effective CLI management is extremely crucial considering its high morbidity and mortality rates  particularly in patients like Mr. Smith with a multiple comorbid condition. Integrated medical and interventional treatments  lifestyle changes  and possible surgical intervention are potential options for managing his condition. Moreover  better control of his diabetes is needed to prevent further complications. 
7,9,87,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial87,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jim McBride  a 67-year-old  retired truck driver  white male presented to the clinic with a complaint of increasingly severe pain in his right lower limb which gets intense during the night. He also reported non-healing sores since the last 3 weeks  his wife had noticed the shin of the leg turning shiny and blue.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Jim has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus that has been poorly controlled for the last 15 years  as well as hypertension. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack year history and quit smoking ten years ago. He also has obesity with a BMI of 32 kg/m2. Past surgical history is notable for appendectomy as a young adult. His regular medication includes metformin  lisinopril  and low-dose aspirin.  Family History:  His father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 69 and his mother passed away at the age of 74 with complications related to diabetes. His younger sister underwent bypass surgery on her leg at age 64. He claimed no history of deep vein thrombosis  known clotting disorders  or malignancy in his family.  Physical Examination:  Physical exam revealed a cool to touch right foot with weak popliteal and absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. Distal hair loss with shiny skin  as well as non-healing  slightly foul-smelling ulcerations on the right foot  were observed. Capillary refill was >10 seconds and pedal edema was present. He had palpable femoral and popliteal pulses on the left side. A monofilament test revealed significant peripheral neuropathy. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.  Pertinent Information:  Mr. Jimmy is retired and lives with his wife  who is his primary caregiver. He used to consume alcohol socially but quit the same time when he quit smoking. Mr. Jim's mobility is also compromised due to consistent limb pain. His diabetes management has been inconsistent  largely due to limited health literacy.  Given the patient’s history  clinical presentation  and physical examination findings  a diagnosis of Critical limb ischemia (CLI) was made.  Management:  Multidisciplinary management is required for holistic care  including optimizing diabetes control  a cardiovascular evaluation for atherosclerotic disease  and a vascular surgery consultation for potential revascularization. Meanwhile  analgesia  wound care  diet optimization  and limb elevation strategies were encouraged.
7,9,88,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial88,Patient's Profile: Mr. Adams  a 68-year-old African-American male  was brought to the emergency department with complaints of increasing pain and discoloration in his right foot over the past three weeks.   Past Medical History: Mr. Adams has a 20-year history of uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and hypertension. He was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease four years ago for which he has been on medication. Despite his medical conditions  he has continued to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 45 years.  Demographics: Mr. Adams is a retired auto mechanic. He lives with his wife of 40 years and is parent to three grown-up children. He maintains a sedentary lifestyle and his diet mostly includes high-fat and high-calorie foods.   Family History: His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 56 and his mother had a stroke in her late sixties. Sibling and children health history is unremarkable except for his younger sister  aged 64  who is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.   Clinical Assessment and Findings: Upon clinical examination  Mr. Adams' right foot showed signs of severe ischemia with areas of dry gangrene  suggestive of critical limb ischemia (CLI). He reported pain at rest and open sores that are slow to heal. Lower extremity pulses were diminished. His Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was calculated to be less than 0.4 indicating severe circulation problems in the affected leg. Buerger's test was positive. His blood panel revealed an elevated glucose level and HbA1c of 8.9%. EKG showed signs of left ventricular hypertrophy.  Diagnosis and Management: Mr. Adams was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia secondary to his peripheral artery disease  uncontrolled diabetes mellitus  chronic smoking and advanced age. An urgent vascular surgery consult was obtained. He was commenced for immediate revascularization to restore blood flow. Concurrently  an endocrinology consult was obtained to optimize his diabetes control. He was also referred to a dietitian and smoking cessation program. His family was counseled about his condition and the necessity of lifestyle modifications.  Conclusion: Mr. Adams' case illustrates the detrimental impact of uncontrolled diabetes  smoking  and unhealthy lifestyle habits on vascular health leading to severe complications like critical limb ischemia. Intensive blood glucose control  lifestyle modifications including quitting smoking  and consultations with specialists for proper management can help prevent the potentially devastating consequences of this condition. Timely revascularization and adequate postoperative care are also key to improving outcomes.
7,9,89,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial89,Patient Profile: The patient is a 76-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Davies. He resides in a nursing home in Pennsylvania. He is a widower with two adult children  and a retired coal miner.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Davies presented with severe resting pain in his right lower leg which has been troubling him for the last 8-9 months. The pain intensifies especially at night causing sleep disturbances. He also reported the presence of non-healing ulcers in his right foot  present for around 4 months.  Medical History: Mr. Davies has a past medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 20 years  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) secondary to a long history of smoking  and hypertension. He had myocardial infarction 8 years ago  followed by coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery  and has been on statins and anti-platelets since then.  Family History: Both of Mr. Davies’ parents suffered from heart disease and his father had suffered from a stroke at the age of 80. His sibling  a brother (now deceased) had a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).   Social History: Mr. Davies has been in a care facility for three years  after the demise of his wife. Prior to this  he was a heavy smoker (two packs per day for 35 years) but has quit smoking since his heart surgery in 2013.  Physical Examination & Diagnosis: On physical examination  the doctor noted coolness of the right leg below knee  pallor on elevation  dependent rubor and diminished pulse intensity. An abnormal finding was pain at rest. An ulcer was noted on the right foot with blacken changes suggesting gangrene. On auscultation  there were coarse crackles sounds in both lungs.   The weighing of all clinical information considered  Mr. Davies was diagnosed with “critical limb ischemia (CLI) of the right leg”.  Treatment Plan: Mr. Davies’ treatment plan is two-fold: management of pain  and restoration of blood flow to the limb. The doctor has planned for revascularization  either surgical or endovascular  to restore blood flow. If this proves impossible  then amputation of the gangrene-affected parts may be inevitable to stop the spread of infection. Efforts will also be made to control Mr. Davies’ blood sugar and blood pressure  to manage his COPD and to counsel him about the disease condition and its possible outcomes  as well as steps he can take to manage it. Close monitoring will be needed throughout the course of treatment and follow-ups arranged.  Prognosis:  The prognosis is uncertain due to the age and other associated comorbid conditions of the patient. It's crucial that Mr. Davies understands the severity of his condition and cooperates fully with the medical team for possible favourable outcomes.
7,9,90,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial90,Patient Presentation:  Patient Details: Mr. Jones  a 65-year-old African American male presents to the clinic.  Chief Complaint: He complains of rest pain in his left foot and non-healing ulcerations on his left toes that have been present for approximately six to eight weeks.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant past medical history including type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He has a 25-year pack history of smoking and admits to drinking alcohol socially. He had an MI five years ago  which was managed with angioplasty and stenting.   Allergies: He has no known drug or food allergies.  Family History: His mother died at age 70 due to a stroke and his father had coronary artery disease. He has one brother who has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  Mr. Jones is in obvious discomfort. His left foot is pale with diminished warmth indicating poor circulation. There are two ulcerations on the dorsal aspect of the second and third toes. Pulses are absent on the left foot. The rest of the examination is unremarkable.   Lab Workup: His fasting glucose and A1C levels are elevated. His lipid profile shows high LDL cholesterol. Other lab results including kidney function tests are within normal limits.  Imaging Studies: Based on clinical suspicion  peripheral angiography was performed showing significant stenosis and occlusion in the left lower limb vessels  confirming the diagnosis of critical limb ischemia.  Impression and Plan: Mr. Jones was admitted for intravenous analgesia  antibiotics and optimized control of his vascular risk factors including his diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. A vascular surgical consult was requested for possible revascularization procedure to restore blood flow.  This case highlights the importance of recognizing critical limb ischemia in patients with risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  and smoking. Early detection and treatment can prevent serious complications such as limb amputation. Patient education about risk factor control is also crucial in these cases.
7,9,91,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial91,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 76-year-old African-American male who initially presented with a chief complaint of worsening pain in his right lower extremity for the past six weeks. The pain was described as severe  constant  and was not alleviated by rest. He reported that the pain had been intermittent for a few months  but it had progressively become more intense and continuous. The patient's lower extremity was observed to be cold  with mottled skin and no palpable pulses.  Past Medical History:  He has a significant past medical history  including a 20-year history of hypertension  well-managed type II diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. The patient had been smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 50 years but quit about five years ago. He also had a minor stroke two years ago with no residual effects.  Family History:  The patient's family history revealed that his father died at the age of 60 from myocardial infarction  and his mother had diabetes and hypertension. His brother  currently 72  has coronary artery disease.  Pertinent Information:  Mr. J reports a decrease in his mobility due to pain  can barely walk short distances  and needs frequent rests  which has dramatically affected his quality of life and made him gain significant weight due to lack of activity. Additionally  he reported no changes in his diet and has been consistent with taking his prescribed antihypertensive and diabetic medications.  On clinical examination  his blood pressure was found to be elevated at 150/90 mmHg  but the rest of the examination was unremarkable except for the lower extremity findings. His laboratory tests were normal.  Power Doppler ultrasound revealed markedly diminished blood flow in the patient's lower right limb. Subsequent angiography confirmed severe peripheral artery disease with critical stenosis of the right superficial femoral artery.  Impression:  The diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was made based on the patient's clinical symptoms  evidence of poor blood circulation in the affected limb  and imaging studies.  Through this case  we can see how several factors played a part in the development of CLI in this patient – uncontrolled hypertension  a significant history of smoking  a sedentary lifestyle  and an undiagnosed peripheral artery disease. It reinforces the importance of regular screenings for peripheral artery disease in patients with significant risk factors or symptoms suggestive of CLI.   Treatment Plan:  Mr. J was referred for vascular intervention with angioplasty and stenting  to improve blood flow to the limb  and to a dietician to help manage his weight. He was also prescribed antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs to manage his cardiovascular risk factors. Regular follow-ups were scheduled to monitor his condition and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
7,9,92,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial92,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  referred by his primary care physician due to complaints of severe pain in his left lower extremity. He has a known medical history of diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia  all managed with medication. He is a former smoker and quit 15 years ago. He has a history of alcohol consumption but cut back substantially over the last 5 years. He is retired and is living with his wife.  Presenting Problem:  The patient has been experiencing worsening pain in his left lower leg over the past four months  especially at night and during rest. It has disturbed his sleep and routine activities  leading to decreased mobility. He also reports a non-healing ulcer on his left foot.  Physical Examination:  Physical examination revealed an active  non-healing ulcer on the dorsal aspect of his left foot. There was pallor on elevation  increased dependency rubor and cold skin temperature on the left lower extremity. Pulse palpation was diminished in the left femoral  popliteal  dorsalis pedis  and posterior tibial arteries  with normal pulses in the opposite extremity.  Tests:  A comprehensive peripheral vascular examination and an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test were performed along with a Doppler ultrasound which confirmed significantly decreased blood flow to the left lower extremity  indicative of advanced peripheral artery disease. His ABI was 0.40 which is indicative of severe arterial insufficiency. Further angiography demonstrated severe obstructive lesions in his left iliac and superficial femoral arteries.  Conclusion:  Based on the clinical evidence  medical history  and diagnostic results  the patient was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Management:  The patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for consideration of possible endovascular revascularization. A consultation with a podiatrist was also made for wound care management.  Family History:  The patient’s father had myocardial infarction at 65  and his mother had a stroke at 70. He has a brother who also has diabetes and hypertension. There’s no known family history of peripheral artery disease or similar vascular diseases.    This case underscores the importance of early recognition and management of risk factors  particularly in individuals with a known medical history of diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia. It also emphasizes the importance of thorough physical examination and the use of ABI in assessing patients suspected of having PAD or CLI. Coping with CLI not only involves alleviating the painful symptoms but also managing the associated wound through proper foot care and possible revascularization.
7,9,93,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial93,Patient Information: Mr. John Smith  a 68-year-old African American male  Presenting Concern: Mr. Smith was brought to the emergency department complaining of severe pain and darkened skin on his left lower leg that has gradually worsened over the last 2 weeks.   Medical History: Mr. Smith is a long-standing patient and his records from prior visits reveal that he is a diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic for the past 15 years. There is a history of Hypertension and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) as well. No other remarkable diseases are identified in his past medical history.   Social History:  The patient is a former smoker who has quit 5 years ago. He reports drinking alcohol socially. He is a retired construction worker who lives with his wife and has limited physical activity due to the pain in his leg.  Family History: His family history reveals that his father had peripheral artery disease (PAD) and died from a stroke  and his mother had coronary artery disease and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.  Examination and Diagnosis: Upon physical examination  the left lower leg was noted to be colder to touch and showed signs of mottled  darkened skin  with non-healing sores. Pedal pulses were not palpable on the left side. These signs were consistent with the onset of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Investigations: An Ankle-Brachial Index was conducted  revealing an ABI score of 0.40 (normal range: 1.0-1.4). A Doppler ultrasound showed significant stenosis in the left popliteal artery.   Management: The patient was started on dual antiplatelet therapy and statins to manage the disease. Subsequently  he was referred to a vascular surgeon to review the possibility of revascularization surgery. His diabetic medication was adjusted  and the patient was also advised to follow a healthy diet and engage in moderate exercise.   Prognosis:  The patient's prognosis is guarded considering his age and the severity of the CLI. The presence of chronic comorbid conditions (Diabetes  Hypertension  CKD) can complicate the recovery and increase the risk of amputation.   This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate management of PAD in preventing the progression to CLI  notably in diabetics. It also underscores the need for patient education and lifestyle modifications in managing chronic conditions. 
7,9,94,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial94,Patient Introduction:   The patient  Mr. Alberto Russo  is a 64-year-old Caucasian male who resides in Sacramento  California. He's a retired construction worker and is currently living alone. Mr. Russo first came to the clinic complaining of ongoing severe discomfort and pain in his left lower limb  particularly while resting.  Medical History:  Mr. Russo has a considerable medical history. He has been a type 2 diabetic for the past 12 years and manages his condition with oral anti-diabetic agents. He is also a hypertensive patient over 10 years and currently has his blood pressure under control with the usage of ACE inhibitors. Mr. Russo is a previous smoker  having quit 15 years ago  but with a total of 30 pack-years.  Current Problem:  Mr. Russo’s chief complaint is the severe pain in left lower limb. He’s been experiencing this pain for the last 2 months  stating it's worse while resting or during the night. He also notices that wounds and ulcers on his left leg heal slower than expected. He had presented with a large non-healing ulcer on his left foot. There is no history of fever  chest pain  or shortness of breath.  Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  the skin of the affected limb was cooler to the touch compared with the opposite limb. Pulses in the left foot were feeble as compared to the right foot. There were no palpable popliteal  femoral  or dorsalis pedis pulses on the left side. The ulcer on his left foot was significant and showed no imminent signs of healing.  Preliminary Diagnosis:  Considering Mr. Russo’s medical history and presenting symptoms  along with the physical examination findings  the preliminary diagnosis was that of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).  Investigation:  Mr. Russo’s Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test results were 0.4. Duplex ultrasound and CT angiography were conducted  revealing a significant decrease in blood flow to the left lower limb with multiple blockages. A vascular examination established the presence of peripheral arterial disease in his left leg.  Management and Treatment  The primary treatment goal for Mr. Russo is to alleviate his pain  heal the foot ulcer  halt disease progression  and improve his overall quality of life. The typical first-line therapy would be balloon angioplasty. Considering the extent and location of his blockages  a vascular specialist will need to determine if he is a candidate for a vascular bypass procedure or angioplasty. In any case  medication adjustments  regular exercise  and a healthy diet will be important parts of his overall management strategy.  Family History:  His father had a history of coronary artery disease and his mother was a type 2 diabetic. There is no known hereditary illness present in the immediate family.   This case presentation highlights the patient’s complex clinical condition and the necessity for a multidisciplinary approach to improve Mr. Russo’s quality of life and reduce the risk of amputation.  Follow-Up:  Mr. Russo was scheduled for a follow-up within two weeks  with instructions to seek immediate medical attention should his condition worsen in the meantime. A vascular specialist will be consulted within this timeframe. During the follow up visit  his wound healing and pain score will be assessed. Future follow-ups will be scheduled on a regular basis as effective management of CLI requires close and continuous care. 
7,9,95,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial95,Patient Information:  	 Mr. Smith  a 65-year-old African-American male  is being evaluated for critical limb ischemia. He hails from a suburban background and is a retired firefighter.   Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Smith has been experiencing ongoing  severe pain in his right lower extremity  even while at rest. He reports a decrease in temperature in his right leg compared to the left one and points out visible color changes in the leg including pallor and redness. He also noticed a non-healing wound on his right toe that appeared about two months ago.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for 15 years and hypertension for ten years. He also was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease 5 years ago and takes aspirin  atorvastatin  and ramipril. He was a heavy smoker  but quit five years ago following his diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease.   Family History:  His father succumbed to an ischemic stroke at the age of 70  and his mother had heart disease. He has one brother currently managed for diabetes and peripheral arterial disease.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  the right foot had weak to non-palpable pulses. A significant decline in temperature was obvious through palpation. A 2cm by 2cm non-healing ulcer was noted on his big toe  with no apparent infection.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Mr. Smith had an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) which was less than 0.40 on the right  pathological state confirming severe obstruction. His complete blood count (CBC)  lipid profile and glucose level showed increased triglycerides and uncontrolled glycemic level.  Management Plan:  Our multidisciplinary approach to Mr. Smith’s critical limb ischemia includes managing his diabetes  hypertension  and cholesterol with appropriate medications  diet  and lifestyle management. He also undergoes revascularization using angioplasty. His wound care was managed by the wound care specialist team. We have discussed the potential of amputation if the situation doesn't improve.  He has been educated on the importance of smoking cessation  maintaining good foot hygiene  exercise  and a balanced diet. Regular follow-ups have been arranged for constant monitoring of his health status and to ensure timely medical intervention. We are also considering the possibility of including Psychosocial support  if necessary.  In conclusion  Mr. Smith's case of critical limb ischemia is complex due to his comorbid conditions. His management plan includes both aggressive treatment to restore blood flow and comprehensive management of his comorbid conditions to prevent future complications.
7,9,96,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial96,Patient Presentation:  Subject Details: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named John Smith.  Past Medical History: John Smith has a history of uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia. He has battled hypertension for the last five years  and is currently on medication for the same. He is a former smoker  with a history of about 50-pack years  but quit 8 years ago. He also underwent CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) following a heart attack 6 years ago. He reports being non-compliant with his diabetic medication regimen in recent months due to financial constraints.  Social History: Mr. Smith lives alone and has been retired for six years now. He does not drink alcohol or use any illegal drugs.   Family History: His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 57  his mother had type 2 diabetes and lived till the age of 73. His younger brother is also diabetic but has it under control with oral medication. There is a family history of heart diseases and type 2 diabetes.  Presenting Illness: Mr. Smith was hospitalized following complaints of severe pain in his left leg  primarily in the calf region. The pain tends to intensify with physical activity but is consistently present  even when resting. He also reported to have noticed a non-healing wound on his left foot.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed pale skin  loss of hair on the lower left limb  non-palpable pulses  and a small necrotic ulcer on the left foot. On auscultation  reduced breath sounds were heard at the bases indicating possible peripheral arterial disease. Lab reports showed increased blood sugar levels.   Diagnosis: Based on all the clinical findings  a diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) secondary to peripheral artery disease was made. This decision was supported by duplex ultrasound results showing severely reduced blood flow in the lower extremity.  Prognosis: The patient is at high-risk due to his age  uncontrolled diabetes  previous history of heart disease  and non-compliance with medication. It is critical to initiate appropriate treatment immediately to prevent limb loss. Long-term management of his diabetes and other comorbidities is also crucial for favorable outcomes.  Plan: The management plan includes revascularization through bypass surgery or angioplasty to restore limb perfusion. It also includes optimizing glycemic control  managing his hypertension and hyperlipidemia  quit smoking counseling  wound care  pain management  and physical rehabilitation post-revascularization surgery.   This case demonstrates the aggressive steps required for managing CLI  particularly in patients with multiple risk factors. It is essential to improve the patient’s compliance with long-term therapy and lifestyle modifications to increase the chances of a successful outcome.
7,9,97,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial97,Patient Profile Patient Initials: M.W  Age: 65  Sex: Male Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Retired Truck Driver Residence: Nashville  Tennessee  Presentation of the Patient M.W.  a 65-year-old retired truck driver  presents with severe pain in the lower extremities  particularly in his right foot. He reports a persistent onset of rest pain over the last six weeks that is not alleviated even during non-ambulatory periods. Physical examination shows a cyanotic right foot and a cold left foot. He also demonstrates intermittent claudication after walking for short distances  further compounded by the presence of non-healing ulcers on the right foot.  Past Medical History M.W. is hypertensive and has been managing it for the past 20 years. He is also a type II diabetic and a chronic smoker  with a history of smoking for the last 40 years  a pack every day. He had a myocardial infarction five years ago and underwent successful angioplasty.  Family History There is a family history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and coronary heart disease in M.W.'s family. His father died of a heart attack at 65  and his older brother (68) suffers from PAD.  Diagnosis Considering the clinical presentation  past medical history  and family history  M.W. was diagnosed with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  the most severe form of PAD.  Current Management Currently  M.W. is on antiplatelet agents  statins  and ACE inhibitors for routine management of his cardiovascular disease and hypertension. His type II diabetes is being controlled using metformin and diet control. He has also been prescribed pain medications to manage his ischemia pain.  In the context of M.W.'s case  his diagnosing physician has referred him to a vascular surgeon for evaluation of his CLI. The possibility of femoropopliteal bypass surgery or an angioplasty has been discussed  based on PACS results.   In addition to medical management  M.W. has been strongly advised to quit smoking  maintain a balanced diet  and keep his hypertension and diabetes under control to prevent further damage.  Prognosis M.W.'s prognosis largely relies on adherence to both medical and lifestyle recommendations given by his provider. With successful surgical intervention  his immediate relief of CLI symptoms is highly likely. However  his past history and continued smoking habit do indicate he is at high risk for recurrent PAD and other cardiovascular conditions. Early intervention and strict compliance to lifestyle modifications will be central in managing his condition.
7,9,98,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial98,Patient Case Presentation  Patient Information: Mr. John Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI). He has been experiencing worsening pain in his left lower extremity  ulcers that didn't heal  and foot discoloration that turned black over the past month.  Demographics: Mr. Smith is a retired construction manager. He is currently living in a suburban area with his wife.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 for the past 20 years and underlying peripheral artery disease (PAD). Other relevant past medical conditions include Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia which are controlled with medication. He quit smoking ten years ago but had a 30-year pack history prior to quitting. He also acknowledges sporadic alcohol ingestion. There is no history of any surgical procedures.  Presenting Complaint: He complains of severe  persistent pain in his left foot  even while at rest. Pain is reported to be 8/10  and not relieved by over-the-counter painkillers.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the left foot appeared pale with blackened areas on multiple toes  indicative of gangrene. Pulses were absent on Doppler examination in the left foot. The temperature of the left foot was significantly lower compared to the right foot. Foot ulcers were noted on the plantar surface. Neurological assessment indicates decreased sensation in the left foot.  Family History: His father died of a heart attack at the age of 70 and his mother had a stroke at 75 but is currently living. He also has a brother who is living with heart disease. Given this history  there might be a genetic susceptibility to atherosclerosis.  Investigations: Blood tests were conducted  confirming poor glycemic control (HbA1c - 8.5%) and abnormal lipid profile. Ankle-Brachial index was significantly decreased in the left lower extremity. An angiography was recommended to pinpoint the exact location and severity of artery blockage.  Next Steps: Given this clinical picture  an urgent vascular surgery consultation is crucial for possible revascularization procedures to restore blood flow and prevent amputation.  In summary  Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old male  with a history of uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus Type 2  Hyperlipidemia  and Hypertension  presenting with critical limb ischemia. His condition is most likely a result of peripheral arterial disease exacerbated by his metabolic conditions and past history of smoking. His immediate treatment plan will aim at pain management  glycemic control  managing his lipid profile  and importantly  re-establishment of blood supply to his ischemic limb. Further education regarding smoking cessation  diet control  and management of diabetes is also essential in management to prevent further complications.
7,9,99,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial99,Case Study:  Patient Overview:  Mr. Carlos Gonzalez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male from Los Angeles  presents with severe pain in his left lower extremity. He lives alone and is independent with ADLs. He has no known allergies and is a non-smoker who quit 15 years ago after a 25-year history of tobacco use.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Gonzalez has a significant past medical history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension  and Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage 3). He is currently on Metformin  Lisinopril  and Amlodipine. Furthermore  he had a surgical history of right eye cataract removal 3 years ago.  Family History:  The patient's family history is critical  with his father passing away due to myocardial infarction at 70 years  and his mother suffering a stroke at 67 years. His younger brother was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease at 65 years old.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Gonzalez has been experiencing severe  intermittent pain in his left calf for the past six months. He reports the pain intensifies while walking but subsides at rest. Recently  he began experiencing pain at rest  predominantly at night. He also noted a non-healing wound on his left foot  which has persisted for the past three months despite ongoing wound care.  Examination and Diagnosis:  Upon examination  his left lower extremity is noticeably cooler compared to the right. Pulses are non-palpable distally and a non-healing ulcerative wound is seen on the medial side of the left foot. Lower extremity peripheral pulses are reduced on the left compared to the right. Based on these findings  a diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) was suspected and confirmed through ABI (Ankle-Brachial Index) which came back as 0.3 for left lower extremity and ultrasound Doppler showing significantly reduced blood flow.  Treatment Plan:  Mr. Gonzalez was referred to a vascular surgeon for further management. His current medications were adjusted with the addition of Cilostazol to improve blood flow and aspirin to prevent clotting. Education provided on blood glucose control  foot care  and the importance of regular follow-ups.   The multidisciplinary team - including the vascular surgeon  nurse  dietician  and a social worker - comes up with a comprehensive care plan which includes optimizing medical therapy  considering revascularization  active surveillance of foot lesions  renal protective strategies  and home assistance considering his living alone circumstances.  This case highlights the importance of a high degree of suspicion for CLI in patients with known risk factors presenting with rest pain or non-healing wounds. Swift diagnosis and management can prevent the dire consequences associated with progression of this disease  including amputation and death.
7,9,100,diagnosis7-prompt9-trial100,Patient Profile: Mr. John Doe  a 78-year-old Caucasian male residing in Seattle  presented with a complaint of worsening pain and skin ulcerations in his right lower extremity  particularly when lying down or walking short distances  for the past four weeks.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has been a long-term smoker with a 40-pack-year history. He has hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  poorly managed due to patient’s non-compliance to medications and diet control. He had a myocardial infarction about six years ago  managed with a coronary artery stent placement.  Family History: There is a strong family history of peripheral artery disease on his mother's side with both his mother and uncle having been treated for this condition. His older brother died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 68 and his father had hypercholesterolemia.  Presenting Symptoms: Four weeks ago  Mr. Doe began experiencing pain in his right lower extremity  particularly in the calf muscle  during walking. The condition has now worsened to the extent the pain persists at rest and increases during the night while laying flat. He has also started developing non-healing sores on the same foot  mostly on weight-bearing areas  such as his heel.  Examination: Physical examination reveals a pale  cold right foot with diminished sensation. Pulses in the right leg are decreased. An ulcer measuring 1.2 cm in diameter and surrounded by necrotic tissue is seen on his right heel. No significant edema or palpable crepitus noted.   Diagnosis: Based on presenting symptoms  clinical examination findings  and past medical history  he was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI) secondary to peripheral artery disease.  Management: Mr. Doe was immediately started on analgesics for pain and antibiotics to prevent infection at the ulcer site. Given his non-healing ulcers and the level of pain he's been experiencing  the vascular surgeon has been consulted for a potential revascularization procedure to restore blood flow. Aggressive management of his co-morbidities  particularly his diabetes and hypertension  are also being pursued. Smoking cessation counseling has been initiated.   Follow Up: He has been referred for wound care for management of the foot ulcer and will continue to receive regular follow-up to assess the effectiveness of his treatment plan and look for any potential complications of CLI  such as tissue necrosis and potential amputation.  Discussion: Critical limb ischemia is the severe form of peripheral artery disease and is a serious condition associated with poor outcomes. As Mr. Doe is also dealing with significant co-morbidities such as hypertension  diabetes  and history of MI  it is crucial that his overall care plan addresses these factors for effective management of his health.

The pain often becomes more intense at night to the extent of disturbing his sleep. Recently  he has also noticed a small non-healing ulcer on his left foot.  Past Medical History: He has uncontrolled diabetes for the past ten years and moderate hypertension for the last eight years. He was also diagnosed as obese a couple of years ago. He has been treated for these conditions  but his adherence to his medication and diet has been suboptimal. No prior history of surgery or any significant injury. He resigned from his job five years ago due to worsening health conditions. He has a history of smoking but quit five years ago.  Family History: His father had peripheral arterial disease and underwent amputation due to gangrene development. His mother had hypertension and died due to stroke.  Review of Systems: In addition to the significant constant pain in the left foot  Mr. Stevens reports feeling intermittent cramps in the same leg during short walks. The pain sometimes improves if he dangles his foot off the edge of the bed. He also notes occasional dizziness  loss of appetite  fatigue and intermittent night sweats.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  the left foot is cooler to touch compared to the right. There is a small  non-healing ulcer on the big toe with minimal discharge. The pulses in the left foot are considerably weaker as compared to the right foot. The rest of the exam was unremarkable.   Diagnosis: Mr. Stevens' condition is suggestive of critical limb ischemia. Subsequent investigations (including Doppler ultrasound  angiography  blood tests  and possibly tissue biopsy) are needed to confirm the diagnosis and the underlying cause.   This clinical scenario emphasizes the importance of understanding the pathophysiology  evaluation  and management of critical limb ischemia  particularly in patients with common risk factors such as diabetes  hypertension  obesity  and smoking.

Mr. Smith also shares that he had experienced a significant loss of appetite and unintended weight loss over the last few months.  Family History: His father died of a heart attack at age 68 and his mother has diabetes and high blood pressure. He has two elder siblings: a sister living with diabetes and a brother who had a stroke at age 60.  On a further probe into lifestyle habits  Mr. Smith admits to smoking heavily and indulging in fatty  fast foods. However  there is no regular exercise and he consumes alcohol moderately.  In conclusion  the case presents a middle-aged man  with a significant history of smoking  hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  who now presents with symptoms suggestive of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). This should provoke thorough examination and prompt intervention to reduce potential risks such as amputation and mortality.
7,10,5,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial5,Case Report:   Demographics:   Mr. Smith  a 75-year-old African-American male  retired construction worker  resident of Charleston  South Carolina. He is a widower with three adult children and lives alone in his own house. He has a 50 pack-year smoking history but quit smoking ten years ago.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a significant medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). He has been diabetic for the past 25 years  managed with Metformin and insulin injections  and hypertensive for 15 years  managed with Lisinopril. He was diagnosed with PAD five years back. His diabetic control has been suboptimal over the years  with a recent HbA1c level of 8.2%. His other risk factors include hyperlipidemia controlled by atorvastatin and a history of smoking.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Smith is presenting with extreme discomfort in his left lower limb  particularly in the foot  that has been persistent for 2 months. He describes the pain as a burning and cramping sensation that is notably severe at rest  especially at night. He has also observed non-healing sores on his toes. The sores started as small blisters two weeks ago and have not shown signs of healing  causing increasing pain and discomfort. Mr. Smith has noticed a progressive decrease in the temperature of his left leg  in comparison with the right one. Along with a disturbing decrease in mobility  he has also started to complain about an inability to sleep because of the unrelenting pain  causing significant distress and impacting his quality of life.  Summary:   This is a case of an elderly male with multiple risk factors including diabetes  hypertension  smoking history  and diagnosed PAD  now presenting with rest pain  non-healing sores  and temperature differences between limbs  suggestive of potential progression to critical limb ischemia. 
7,10,6,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial6,Patient Profile: A 72-year-old Caucasian male  Past Medical History: Patient has a medical history of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension  and Tobacco use. He was diagnosed with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) 5 years ago. Despite undergoing angioplasty  the patient has not seen significant improvement in symptoms.  Key Complaints:  The patient presents with severe pain in his right lower leg that has been worsening over the past six months. The pain occurs even at rest and becomes excruciating at night (rest pain). He also informs that he has been noticing non-healing sores on his right foot and some areas have turned blackish. Despite using prescribed oral antiplatelets and statins  the symptoms appear to be worsening notably the pain and sores.   Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  the patient's right leg appears discolored with a bluish/pale hue. There are some non-healing sores visible  mainly on the foot and toes. Popliteal and Pedal pulses are weak on the right leg compared to the left. The leg feels colder compared to the other limb. There is also observed muscle atrophy in the lower limb.  Given the patient's history and current symptoms  it's crucial to consider the possibility of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) in this case. This condition  a severe form of PAD  occurs when there's a significant reduction in blood flow to the limbs  generally due to atherosclerosis.   He should be subjected to diagnostic imaging tests  such as an ankle-brachial index (ABI)  doppler ultrasound or angiography  and if required  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) or Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) for further assessment. It is crucial to manage this case promptly as CLI can lead to limb loss if not treated properly. Treatment modalities may involve medical  surgical  or endovascular approaches depending on the severity and the patient's overall health condition.    This case is designed to help you understand the signs and symptoms of Critical Limb Ischemia  its diagnosis process  and treatment options. It's essential for medical students to know the severity of this disease and the importance of early detection.
7,10,7,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial7,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Christopher  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer  from a mid-sized town in Ohio  is presenting to the hospital. He is a non-smoker (quit 10 years ago)  moderate alcohol consumption (2-3 drinks per week)  with a BMI of 28.   Past Medical History:  His past medical history includes well-controlled type II diabetes for the past 14 years  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in 2016 which was managed with coronary artery stenting. His medications include metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin.  Key Complaints:   He reports a 6-month history of increasing painful cramping and heaviness in his left calf muscle (characteristic of claudication) that only occurs with exercise or by walking short distances (approximately half a block). He also reports experiencing numbness and coldness in his left foot and ankle. In the past two weeks  he’s noticed that the pain seems to persist a bit  even when resting. He also reports a small ulceration near his left big toe that is not healing well despite local wound care.   In addition to that  the patient has noticed a slower growth rate in his hair and toenails  loss of hair on his toes  and discoloration of the skin on his legs. The above symptoms are raising suspicion for worsening peripheral artery disease (PAD) progressing to critical limb ischemia. The lack of improvement in his leg symptoms despite optimal medical therapy and lifestyle adjustments  along with the presence of foot ulcer indicates the need for further vascular assessment and possible revascularization.
7,10,8,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial8,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. John Thompson  a 72-year-old male.  Demographics: Mr. Thompson is a retired engineer  is married  and has three adult children. He resides in a suburban residential area. He is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history but quit 15 years ago.   Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago and is regularly taking metformin. He was also diagnosed with hypertension 7 years ago and is on daily low-dose aspirin and lisinopril. He had colon cancer  for which he underwent surgical resection two years ago; follow-ups have confirmed he is currently cancer-free. There is no known allergy history. He reports no prior surgeries or significant illnesses.  Key Complaints:  Over the past three months  Mr. Thompson has reported experiencing progressive discomfort in his left lower leg. He initially felt the pain while walking but noted it usually disappears with rest. However  over the past month  the pain does not seem to go away  and it keeps him awake at night. He also mentioned that his left foot feels colder than the right one.  Over the past week  he has noticed a non-healing wound on his left big toe. He initially dismissed it  thinking it was an ordinary foot ulcer  but he became increasingly worried when the pain seemed to become almost unbearable.  He has not had any associated symptoms such as chest pain  dizziness  difficulty in breathing  or palpitations.   On inspection  his left foot appears dusky  and a painful ulcer measuring about 2x2 cm is seen on the first toe's dorsal aspect with surrounding erythema. There are also hair loss  shiny skin  and brittle nails indicating chronic ischemia.  Pulses in the left foot are not palpable  but the right foot pulses are intact. The capillary refill time in the left foot's toe is markedly prolonged  the motor power and sensation in the left lower limb appear reduced compared to the right side.  This clinically appears to be a case of critical limb ischemia  likely associated with his past medical history of diabetes and hypertension. The non-healing wound may represent a complication of severe peripheral artery disease. An urgent vascular surgery consult and further diagnostic studies like pressure index and arteriography are warranted. The case will require a multidisciplinary approach involving vascular surgeons  endocrinologists  and wound care specialists  along with comprehensive patient education about diabetes and foot care.

The patient mentions that he has a marked reduction in his ability to independently manage his daily activities due to the pain in his leg. Change in lifestyle habits has been noted  with the patient avoiding activities like walking his dog due to leg pain.   This clinical situation presented should guide students to suspect peripheral artery disease (PAD) with progression to critical limb ischemia (CLI) due to poor blood supply  necessitating prompt diagnosis and proper intervention. Discuss possible risk factors including hypertension  advanced age  smoking history  diabetes  family history  and obesity. Discuss pain assessment including rest pain and claudication  and the need for a physical examination including skin color  temperature  presence of ulcers  along with additional diagnostic testing such as Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  Doppler ultrasound  angiography as necessary. The importance of treatment  addressing modifiable risk factors  and potentially life-saving surgical interventions should also be emphasized.
7,10,13,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial13,Patient Information: Mr. Thomas Grey  a 73-year-old Caucasian male  retired teacher.  Demographic Information: Lives with his wife in suburban Ohio  nonsmoker  and drinks alcohol occasionally. His diet lacks fruits and vegetables  and he leads a sedentary lifestyle.   Past Medical History: Mr. Grey has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  which has been poorly controlled over the years. He also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He had a minor myocardial infarction 5 years ago  which was managed successfully with medication. He is currently on Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Grey visited the clinic complaining of recurrent pain in his right lower leg  especially when walking  which he describes as a cramping sensation. The pain usually subsides with rest  but in the last week  he began to feel pain even at rest. He also noticed that his right foot appears paler than the other and feels cooler to touch. He stated that he's been having trouble sleeping due to the pain and noticed the development of non-healing sores on his foot.   These symptoms hint at a progression to critical limb ischemia  characterized by excruciating pain even at rest  pale appearance of the foot (pallor)  cool sensation (suggestive of poor perfusion)  and non-healing sores. This case will help medical students understand the management of patients with critical limb ischemia. They can consider this case to improve their clinical decision-making skills regarding this pathology and to understand the essential role of controlling predisposing factors such as diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia in managing ischemic symptoms.

His mother and two other siblings are relatively healthy.  Social History:  Mr. Smith has been retired for ten years and lives with his wife. Their adult children live out of state but visit often. He is not very active due to the pain in his foot but attends regular card games with friends at the local senior center. He reports no travel history in the last year.  Key Findings:  On physical examination  his right foot is colder than his left. The skin is shiny  hairless  and bluish-purple in color. Two non-healing ulcers with a small amount of purulent discharge are present on his big toe and heel. His right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are not palpable  and his Ankle-Brachial Index is lower than 0.4.  Given Mr. Smith's symptoms  clinical examination  and history  the case aims to educate medical students on diagnosing  managing  and understanding the implications of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).   Key Learning Objectives: - Understand the risk factors and recognize the clinical presentation of CLI - Importance of controlling comorbidities like diabetes  hypertension  and dyslipidemia. - Understanding the use of Ankle-Brachial Index in diagnosing CLI. - Understand the current guidelines for the management and treatment options for CLI. - Importance of patient education in CLI management  dealing with quitting smoking  and lifestyle modifications.
7,10,17,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial17,Patient Case:   Demographics: Patient J.T. is a 67-year-old African-American male  retired factory worker  long-term smoker with a pack/day smoking history for the past 40 years. He lives with his wife in a rural area quite far from the hospital.  Past Medical History: He has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 12 years ago which is poorly controlled. His Hemoglobin A1c is consistently over 9%. J.T. also has a history of Hypertension. He has Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) diagnosed 5 years ago. A stent was placed in his right leg due to severe stenosis in the femoral artery 3 years back. J.T has a BMI of 27 indicating that he is overweight  and reports imperfect adherence with his oral medications due to financial constraints.  Key Complaints: The patient has recently been experiencing increasing pain in his left leg  even when at rest  and notes that it has been disrupting his sleep. In addition to the rest pain  he mentions an ulcer on his left big toe that hasn't healed in over a month. He reports a feeling of coldness in his left leg when compared to his right. Lastly  he mentions that the pain becomes slightly relieved when his leg is in a dependent position  thereby causing difficulty in walking.  These complaints  the patient's demographic  and medical history are suggestive of critical limb ischemia. The next steps should include a thorough physical examination  further diagnostic tests including Ankle-Brachial Index and imaging studies and consulting with a specialist for evaluating appropriate treatment options including revascularization procedures or medications. 
7,10,18,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial18,Patient Information:  Ms. C. A. is a 70-year-old Caucasian female  a retired schoolteacher who lives alone. She is slightly overweight (BMI 27.5) and a former smoker  having quit about a decade ago.  Past Medical History:  Ms. C. A. has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has been on medication for these health conditions for approximately 10 years. She had an episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) 6 years ago but has been stable since. There is no history of any surgeries. She also reports that for about a year  she has had intermittent leg pain while walking which got better with rest.   Key Complaints:  Ms. C. A. presents with severe pain in her left leg that has been increasing over the past 3 months. She reports that she initially felt the pain only while walking but now she experiences it even while at rest  making her nights particularly difficult. The pain  she says  is mostly in her calf but sometimes radiates to the foot. The foot often feels cold. Over the past few weeks  she has noticed a dark patch developing on her big toe.   Additionally  she mentions that she occasionally feels dizzy and her balance has been off on a couple of occasions  but she hasn't fallen. Her blood pressure is well-controlled  her diabetes however has had fluctuating control with HbA1c readings ranging over 7-8% in the past year.  Assessment:  This case prompts concern about the potential worsening of peripheral artery disease  likely progressing to critical limb ischemia (CLI) given her inactivity due to pain  development of skin changes on the foot  and overall worsening of symptoms. Her diabetes  hypertension  age  and smoking history place her at significant risk. Furthermore  her occasional impairment of balance and dizziness may be associated with cerebrovascular disease  already echoed in her past TIA episode.   Plan:  A thorough physical exam focused on the cardiovascular and nervous system is warranted. She should be referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation. Investigations should include an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) and additional imaging as deemed suitable by the specialist. Enhanced diabetic control and proper foot care should be emphasized. Possible interventions should be considered promptly to improve blood flow if CLI is confirmed  to prevent possible complications like amputation. Additionally  her cerebrovascular health should be assessed. 
7,10,19,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial19,Patient Information: Sex: Male Age: 70 years old Ethnic Background: Caucasian  Past Medical History: The patient is a smoker with a 40-year smoking history  diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  uncontrolled type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He has a history of intermittent claudication but denies any chest pain or symptoms of angina. No history of previous strokes or transient ischemic attacks. He has not had any surgeries in the past.  Key Complaints: The patient presents with extreme pain at rest in his right lower leg which has been ongoing for the past two weeks. Describing it as a severe  burning kind of pain  noticeably worse at night when he's lying down and slightly eased when he dangles his leg off the bed. He reports new onset non-healing ulcers on his toes and a noticeable decrease in the temperature of his foot compared to the other. There is no noticeable change in color. He denies any trauma to the site.   Family History: The patient's father had a history of coronary artery disease and passed away in his early 70s due to a myocardial infarction. The patient's mother has high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.   Social History: The patient is a retired office worker who lives with his wife. He smokes one packet of cigarettes a day for the past 40 years  makes moderate use of alcohol. He denies any illicit drug use. His level of physical activity is low  mainly due to leg pain.  Review of Systems: The patient reports significant fatigue and occasional shortness of breath  which he attributes to his smoking habit. He also notes some mild constipation  which is a common side effect of his pain medication. No complaints of chest pain  palpitations  or dizziness. No other significant symptoms in other systems.   These complaints and history hints towards Critical Limb Ischemia. The patient’s uncontrolled diabetes and smoking are primary risks for the progression of his PAD to the more severe end-stage of CLI. The rest pain indicates that the ischemia is also present even in resting conditions and the non-healing wounds suggest insufficient blood supply in his lower extremities.
7,10,20,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial20,"Patient Information: Patient is Mr. John Doe  a 67-year-old African American male.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Doe reports """"resting pain"""" for the past three weeks primarily in his left lower leg especially at night. He also states an ulcer developed on the big toe of his left foot about a week ago which is not healing. He also notes increasing difficulty in walking and maintaining balance.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of type 2 diabetes for the last 15 years  which has been poorly controlled. He also indicates that he has a long history of cigarette smoking  averaging two packs a day for around 35 years  mate  hypertension and has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease two years prior  managed conservatively. Last year  he underwent CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting) for triple vessel disease.  Surgical History: Apart from CABG  he underwent appendectomy at the age of 35.  Family Medical History: His father had coronary artery disease and mother had hypertension.  Physical Examination:  Examination reveals a non-healing dry gangrene at the base of the left big toe. Skin over the left lower limb is shiny  with loss of hair  and cold to touch. Both of his lower legs show decreased sensation to fine touch and temperature. Distal pulses in the left leg (dorsalis pedis  posterior tibial) were weak and femoral pulse seems normal.   This case presents a classic patient profile of Critical Limb Ischemia  the severe stage of peripheral artery disease  prompting the need for rapid diagnosis and treatment to forestall potential limb loss."
7,10,21,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial21,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Johnson  Age: 72 years  Sex: Male  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired mechanic  Past Medical History: 1. Diabetes mellitus type II for 15 years  managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. 2. Hypertension for 10 years  managed with medication. 3. History of smoking - 40 pack years. 4. Hyperlipidemia diagnosed 8 years ago  currently on lipid-lowering agents. 5. Previous Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)  2 years ago  no residual deficits.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Johnson presents with rest pain in both legs  more prominent on the right side. He reports that the pain is intense during night hours  and interferes with his sleep. There has been a noticeable change in color of his distal extremities to a bluish tint. He also mentions chronic non-healing sores on his right foot for the past two months. He experiences tremendous pain while walking even short distances  which requires him to halt (Intermittent claudication). Mr. Johnson has lost weight because of reduced activity and decreased appetite due to his illness.  Examinations and Diagnosis: To develop a suitable plan of intervention  an ankle-brachial index (ABI) test  ultrasound  angiogram  and a blood test including HbA1c and lipids can be suggested. Mr. Johnson's constellation of symptoms aligned with the results of the investigations lead to the diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia.  In this case  medical students should be taught about the risk factors for Peripheral Artery Disease and Critical Limb Ischemia  symptoms and signs of both conditions  interpretation of investigations like ABI and angiogram  and the significance of holistic management involving control of diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia along with the specific management of the Ischemia. Perfusion enhancing techniques  such as angioplasty  surgery  or even amputation in severe cases  should be discussed. Emphasize the need for smoking cessation  maintaining a healthy lifestyle to control risk factors  and regular follow-up.  Morbidity and mortality associated with untreated CLI should also be highlighted along with the economic and psychological burden endured by the patients. Additionally  the role of a diabetic foot in CLI can be an integral part of the teaching session.
7,10,22,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial22,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: Name: John Doe Age: 70 years old Sex: Male Occupation: Retired school teacher Race: Caucasian Insurance Status: Medicare  Past Medical History: - Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes 20 years ago - Smoking history of about 25 years  quit 10 years ago - Diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia - Had a previous myocardial infarction 5 years ago - Current medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and Adderall  Key Complaints: Mr. Doe presented to the clinic complaining of an array of symptoms in his right leg  which primarily included pain  heaviness  and noticeable colour change. He explained that for the past two weeks he had been experiencing severe pain in his right calf and foot even while at rest. Unlike previous instances  the pain did not alleviate upon leg elevation  but exacerbated at night making it difficult for him to sleep.   Further  he stated that he had noticeably reduced sensation in the same leg and was having difficulty walking. He also noticed a cold feeling in his foot in comparison to his other extremities. The patient mentioned that a small wound on the calf that had not healed for a while and was becoming darker over time. Upon inspection  the right foot appeared to be pale and cooler to touch.  The above case presents critical limb ischemia which typically presents with pain at rest  non-healing wounds  and symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This patient  being diabetic and having had a significant smoking history  is at high risk. Additionally  his cardiac history may also influence his overall prognosis and increase his risk for adverse events. Prompt diagnosis and intervention would be necessary to save the limb and to improve the patient's quality of life.

Past Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 20 years  and Blood Hypertension (HTN) for last ten years. He has been a smoker for the last 40 years with a smoking history of 30 pack-years  and also has a positive familial history of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD).   Key Complaints:   Mr. Brown has been referred to vascular clinic with persistent pain in his right foot that has been worsening over the past 2 months. The pain is severe enough to keep him awake at night  which he describes as burning and aching. He feels relief when he hangs his foot over the side of the bed. Recently  the patient noticed non-healing sores on his right foot and it appears discolored (bluish). His foot is cold to touch even in warm conditions. Moreover  he also reports claudication  a pain in his calf muscle during walking  which subsides at rest. Pain has restricted him from completing his daily chores  hence has reduced his quality of life. He has been experiencing loss of appetite and unintentional loss of weight along with overall weakness.   In summary  Mr. Brown is a senior adult diabetic and hypertensive patient with a significant smoking history  presenting with a complaint of rest pain  non-healing ulcers  discoloration of the foot  and claudication. These symptoms suggest critical limb ischemia  most likely due to Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). It is crucial to evaluate further and confirm the diagnosis by conducting proper tests and initiate necessary management steps.

He mentions that the pain often intensifies at night and sometimes wakes him up from sleep. He also complains of noticeable coldness in his leg compared to the other one and has noticed some areas turning dark in color near his foot. Over the past few weeks  he has developed non-healing sores on his foot. He also mentions experiencing some difficulty walking due to the pain. He reports that he often tries hanging his leg over the bed for some relief from the pain.   Summary:   A 68-year-old male patient with a medical history consisting notably of type 2 diabetes and hypertension presents with continuous pain in his lower extremities that gets worse during periods of rest and coldness in his right leg. The patient also reports having non-healing sores on his foot  a change in the color of his skin  and difficulty walking  indicating the possibility of critical limb ischemia. Given his smoking and family history  he is of high risk  making rapid assessment and intervention crucial.
7,10,27,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial27,"Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 72 Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian   Past Medical History: John has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He also has a 10 years history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. He is currently taking Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.  Presentation:  John presented with a 3-week history of increasing right leg pain  which he initially attributed to """"old age"""". He described the pain as a constant  severe burning sensation focused on his right calf and foot that intensified at night. In the past week  the pain has escalated  causing sleep disruption  and it is now occurring  even at rest.  On questioning  he also mentioned that he had noticed some skin discoloration in his right foot along with non-healing sores on his toes. His right foot felt colder than his left one. He admitted that he had recognized these symptoms progressively over the last two months but didn't mention them because he thought they were not serious.  His pain worsened when he elevated the right leg and slightly alleviated when he hung his leg down. He also experienced pain when walking  noting that he could barely walk a block without needing to stop because of the discomfort. The symptoms were affecting his quality of life  as he could no longer take his daily walks in the neighborhood.   No recent trauma  fever  or weight loss was reported. He also denied any chest pain  shortness of breath  or headaches. His review of systems was otherwise unremarkable.   This case provides an example of critical limb ischemia  a severe obstruction of the arteries which drastically reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to cause severe pain and skin ulcers or sores. The medical students will have to go through a physical examination  evaluate the patient's risk factors  carry out appropriate diagnostic tests  and decide on the correct course of therapeutics."

7,10,29,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial29,Patient Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics:  • Name: Mr. Paul Matthews • Age: 68 years • Gender: Male  • Occupation: Retired Army Officer • Ethic Origin: Caucasian   Past Medical History:  Mr. Matthews has been previously diagnosed with Type II diabetes managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has a history of hypertension  controlled with medication  and he is both a former smoker and drinker. In addition  he has hyperlipidemia under treatment with a statin. There is a peripheral vascular disease history confirmed 3 years prior. There is no known history of any allergy.  Current History of Present Illness:  Mr. Matthews has presented with a two week history of worsening pain in his left calf  more pronounced when walking short distances (within 200 meters) and relieved by rest. He has also been experiencing increasing instances of numbness and coldness in the same leg. Over the past few days  he has had difficulty sleeping due to severe pain in his left foot  rising to the level of rest pain.   On further questioning  Mr. Matthews discloses that he has been occasionally noticing a non-healing small wound on his left big toe for the past month  which he initially ascribed to his diabetes. He also noted that his left foot appeared paler than the right one.  The above symptomatology suggests that Mr Matthews's condition has advanced into critical limb ischemia (CLI). Further diagnostic tests and immediate clinical attention will be necessary to prevent imminent complications which can range from major amputation to a high cardiovascular risk.
7,10,30,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial30,Patient Information:  Name: Johansson  Alfred Sex: Male Age: 51 Race: Asian  Profession: Software Engineer   Chief Complaint:  Alfred has been experiencing severe pain in his right leg that worsens when he is at rest. He also complains about Persistent numbness and coldness in the lower part of the right leg.  Past Medical History:  Alfred has a history of Diabetes Mellitus (Type II) for the past 10 years  Hypertension  and hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol). He is also a regular smoker for the last 30 years. He had a cardiac stent placement 2 years ago due to coronary artery disease.   Vitals:  Alfred's blood pressure remains elevated  despite his hypertensive medications. His heart rate is slightly rapid. His temperature  respiration rate  and oxygen saturation are all within normal range.   Symptoms: Alfred reported discomfort in his right leg that became particularly severe at night  often disturbing his sleep. He also noticed color changes like paleness and blueness in his right leg and foot. He mentioned that he has had multiple wounds on his right foot that have been slow healing for the past few months.   He has had a weight loss of approximately 15 pounds over the last 5 months  which is not associated with any intention to lose weight or any changes in his diet or physical activity. This could be due to the associated malabsorption or hyper-metabolic state.  Alfred has been experiencing erectile dysfunction over the last year. He does not have any complaints regarding chest pain  palpitation  or shortness of breath.   Physical Examination:  Upon examination  a non-healing ulcer was noted on the distal part of his right foot. The right leg is cold compared to the left  with diminished sensation. There is notable weakness in the right leg  and peripheral pulses (femoral  popliteal  posterior tibial  and dorsalis pedis) are faintly palpable or absent on the right side compared to the left.   Possible Diagnosis:  Given his symptoms and physical examination findings  Alfred could be suffering from critical limb ischemia  likely secondary to the large amount of plaque build-up (atherosclerosis) in the arteries due to his history of smoking  diabetes  hypertension  and high cholesterol. Further investigations such as an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  duplex ultrasonography  CT scan  or angiogram may be required to support this diagnosis.

Patient further complains that the leg  particularly around the foot  is colder than the left. He had noticed intermittent pain during walking last two months  which resolved upon rest. However  he ignored it due to lack of awareness.   Upon physical examination  the right foot appeared pale and was cool to touch. Two of the toes showed signs of necrosis and there was reduced sensation in the entire foot. Pulses in the right lower extremity (popliteal  posterial tibial  dorsalis pedis) were feeble.  The patient denies any chest pain  breathlessness  or other systemic symptoms. The preliminary diagnosis was made as Critical Limb Ischemia of the right lower limb. The patient was then referred for further vascular assessment and intervention.
7,10,32,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial32,Patient Information: Mr. John Smith  67-year-old  Caucasian male  retired firefighter from a small suburb in Milwaukee.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years. He is an ex-smoker but had a heavy smoking history of 30-pack years. He also has a history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  peripheral artery disease (PAD)  and has had a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack) 7 years ago. His current medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  Amlodipine  and Atorvastatin.  Key Complaints: Mr. Smith presented to the clinic complaining of severe  worsening pain in his right lower limb which he described as sharp and persistent. The pain was predominantly affecting his right foot. He indicated that the pain was exacerbated during walking and sometimes present at rest  causing him continuous discomfort  especially during the night. He mentioned a recent unintentional weight loss and declining activity levels due to the pain. On further inquiry  Mr. Smith also reported a non-healing wound on his right big toe. He had noticed it about three weeks ago  but he thought it was a small injury and would heal itself.  Summary: The patient is a 67-year-old man with a significant medical history including type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  dyslipidemia  PAD and a history of myocardial infarction. His presentation is in keeping with critical limb ischemia  characterized by severe pain in his lower right limb  even at rest  and a non-healing wound on his right toe.
7,10,33,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial33,Patient Case:   Ms. Jane Cyrus  a 68-year-old African American woman  presents to your outpatient clinic. Her past medical history includes smoking two packs of cigarettes per day for the last 35 years  Type 2 diabetes mellitus for 20 years  and uncontrolled hypertension for 15 years. She reports medication non-adherence due to financial constraints and difficulty understanding the importance of medication.   Key Complaint:  Over the past three months  Jane has been suffering from significant discomfort in her left leg  especially during walking. She describes it as a severe  crampy calf pain that appears after about 200 feet of walking and dissipates after a few minutes of rest. Recently  she reported having the same pain  but at rest  prominently at night. She stated that dangling her leg over the bedside appears to temporarily mitigate the pain. She also noted a progressive color change (pallor to bluish) and a decrease in temperature in her foot. She expressed concern over her left big toe  which has developed a non-healing ulcer over the past few weeks. The identified symptoms and medical history point towards the possibility of critical limb ischemia.   Educational Goals:  1. Identify critical limb ischemia considering the symptoms and the medical history of the patient. 2. Understand the crucial risk factors (smoking  diabetes  hypertension) of critical limb ischemia. 3. Recognize the importance of patient adherence to medications in managing chronic conditions. 4. Approach the management plan for a patient with critical limb ischemia. 5. Understand the implications of non-treatment or delayed treatment of critical limb ischemia. 6. Enhance patient communication skills  including discussion on the importance of medication adherence.   Suggested Additional Learning Activities:  1. Role-play: Discuss how you would approach and educate this patient about her condition and the importance of medication management.  2. Case Study Review: Examine a few more patient cases highlighting the variation in symptoms  demographics  and prognosis of critical limb ischemia patients. 3. Seminar: Invite a Vascular Surgeon to discuss the surgical aspect and latest advances in treating critical limb ischemia. 4. Journal Club: Assign recent research articles on critical limb ischemia for critical reading and discussion. 
7,10,34,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial34,Patient Demographics:  Mr. Abdullah Ali  a 72-year-old male of Middle Eastern descent  is a retired engineer residing in a suburb outside of Houston  Texas with his wife. He is a smoker and indulges occasionally in alcohol.  Past Medical History: Mr. Ali  suffering from Type 2 diabetes and peripheral arterial disease  has a history of hypertension which is well-controlled with medication. He is also renowned for occasional episodes of angina pectoris. He had a coronary artery bypass graft surgery 11 years ago and takes daily medication for diabetes  high cholesterol  and hypertension.  Key Complaints: Mr. Ali presents with escalating pain in his left lower leg that has persisted for the past 3 weeks. Previously  the pain was intermittent  but it has become more constant over the last couple of days. The pain is especially severe at night and disturbs his sleep. He reports that even while at rest  his leg throbs painfully.   He also indicates a noticeable temperature difference when touching his left and right legs. The affected limb appears paler and feels cooler to the touch. The pain is debilitating  making it difficult for him to walk short distances. Recently  he has noticed swelling and redness around a non-healing ulcer on his left foot  which was initially a small blister but has since expanded.  Mr. Ali admits an unintentional weight loss over the last couple of months due to loss of appetite which he had attributed to stress. He hasn't been checking his glucose levels regularly  and his last HbA1C level was 9% six months ago.  Recognizing these symptoms  Mr. Ali came to the hospital fearing a critical condition requiring immediate attention. Indeed  these symptoms point toward Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which drastically reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores.
7,10,35,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial35,"Patient Information: Mr. Johnson  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  who is a retired truck driver  comes to your clinic.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has been a smoker for over 40 years. He suffers from controlled hypertension  moderate obesity (BMI 32)  Type 2 diabetes (managed by oral hypoglycemic)  and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). He has no known allergies to any medication.   Key Complaints: Mr. Johnson complains of an increasing pain in his right calf that he describes as """"cramping """" especially when walking. He states this pain often subsides after a few minutes of rest. However  he reports that  over the past week  the pain has started to occur even when he's not walking but simply resting  sitting or lying down  especially at night. He also noticed that his right foot feels cooler than the left one and appears paler. He is concerned as he noticed a wound on his right big toe that is taking a while to heal. He has no fever  chest pain  palpitations  or dyspnea.   This case scenario suggests a progression of peripheral arterial disease to critical limb ischemia  complicated by poor circulation and non-healing wounds secondary to the underlying diabetes. Further investigations (like Doppler ultrasound  ankle-brachial index  and angiography) and management steps should be discussed further  with the consideration of involving a multidisciplinary team to preserve the limb and prevent amputation."
7,10,36,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial36,"Case Summary:  Patient Demographics:   The patient is a 75-year-old African American male with a past medical history of smoking two packs per day for 50 years  chronic hypertension  and type II diabetes mellitus that is poorly controlled.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presents to the clinic with complaints of significant pain in his right lower leg. He describes the pain as """"constant"""" and """"worst when I walk""""  which has gradually worsened over the past six months. He also reported that his foot feels cold all the time  while the skin appears pale and dry. Furthermore  he has noticed an ulcer on the lateral aspect of the forefoot that refuses to heal and sometimes discharges a foul-smelling liquid. Moreover  he has been feeling weak and has lost over 15 pounds in the past three months due to lack of appetite.  Past Medical History:   The patient's medical history is significant for Type II Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 15 years ago and is currently being controlled with Metformin. However  his last HbA1C was 9.3%  indicating poor glycemic control. Hypertension is controlled with Lisinopril. He has also been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia for which he is taking Atorvastatin. He previously worked as a dock worker but has been retired for 10 years. No known drug allergies are reported.  Social History:  The patient reports he smoked cigarettes for the past 50 years with a 100-pack-year history but now is trying to quit. He drinks alcohol occasionally and denies any illicit drug use. He lives alone after his wife passed away three years ago. He admits that he is non-compliant with his medications and often forgets to take them.   Family History:  His father suffered a heart attack at age 62. His elder brother and sister are both hypertensive  and his sister also has Type II diabetes. No family history of cancer or any genetic diseases.   This case could be used to discuss the typical presentation of Critical Limb Ischemia and underline the importance of a thorough patient history and physical examination in reaching a proper diagnosis. It is also an opportunity to discuss the role of early prevention  risks associated with smoking  and the importance of managing diabetes and hypertension in preventing vascular complications."
7,10,37,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial37,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 72-year-old African American male. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 27.3 and lives a sedentary lifestyle. The patient is a former construction worker. He is a retired widower living alone  with two adult children living out of state.   Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus which have been managed with medication for the past 15 years. He also has a 30-pack year smoking history but quit smoking ten years ago.   Key Complaints: The patient came to the outpatient clinic complaining of severe pain in his lower left leg which has been worsening over the past few weeks. The pain escalates at night and wakes him from sleep  while slight relief is achieved only by hanging his leg off the edge of the bed.   The patient also reports intermittent claudication after walking short distances  and his movements have become increasingly limited due to the persistent pain. Additionally  the patient noticed the onset of sores on his toes that do not appear to be healing. He reports changes in color on his leg  perceived cold temperature at the foot  and some degree of numbness. The patient has not noticed similar symptoms in his right leg.   These symptoms suggest that this patient may be suffering from critical limb ischemia in his left lower extremity. The patient’s type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and extensive smoking history suggest a long-term exposure to peripheral artery disease risk factors  which could potentially complicate the medical picture. The medical teaching case will be designed with this information as a focal point.
7,10,38,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial38,Patient Information: Mr. Henry Thompson  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  residing in a suburban neighborhood  present with complaints of chronic pain in his right lower limb. He is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs around 200lbs  BMI 29.5  indicating obesity.   Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a history of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 15 years which is currently managed with Metformin. He also has hypertension under control with Lisinopril. He is a former smoker and has been smoking almost a pack per day for 40 years but quit ten years ago. He also underwent a triple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery five years back due to his ischemic heart disease.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Thompson experiences chronic  severe pain in his right leg which has been worsening over the past several months. The pain often becomes severe at night  disrupting his sleep. He also reports experiencing pain while walking even short distances  forcing him to stop - a symptom of intermittent claudication. Recently  he has noticed his right foot turning pale and cool compared to the left. He has also pointed out a non-healing ulcer on his right toe.  Given his history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) risk factors such as diabetes  smoking  hypertension  obesity  and a personal history of other atherosclerotic diseases  Mr. Thompson shows signs of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe stage of PAD.  Next steps would involve a detailed physical examination  including palpation of pulses  skin inspection  ankle-brachial index measurement  and further definitive tests such as angiography. Prompt diagnosis and targeted medical therapy  potentially revascularization  are essential to preserve limb function where possible or consider potential amputation. Extra care should be taken to manage patient comorbidities and modify risk factors.
7,10,39,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial39,Patient Information: Mr. Richard Thompson  68-year-old African American male.  Medical History: A past smoker with a 20 pack-year history  quit 10 years ago. He is a diagnosed hypertensive and diabetic patient with moderately controlled levels on medication for the past 5 years. Has a family history of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  Chief Complaints: Mr. Thompson reports increasing pain in his right calf  especially during walking  that has been progressively worsening over the past 6 months. Pain started to occur even at rest over the past week. He also complains of a non-healing wound on his right foot for the past 3 weeks.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination reveals a slightly overweight man with BP 150/90 mm Hg with moderate distress due to pain. Right foot shows coolness to touch  feeble popliteal and dorsalis pedis pulses  and a shallow  poorly perfused ulcer on the dorsal aspect. The left foot appears normal with palpable pulses. Blood sugar levels are mildly elevated.  Impression: Symptoms and signs suggest possible Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) of right lower limb  likely secondary to uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  and history of smoking. The patient requires immediate hematological and radiological investigations.  Discussing Points:  1. Basics of PAD and CLI 2. Importance of Risk Factors like diabetes  male sex  smoking  and African American race 3. The role of Ankle-brachial index (ABI) in initial diagnosis 4. Role of additional investigations: Doppler ultrasound  CT angiography  or MR angiography 5. Standard management including lifestyle modifications  medical therapies  and various revascularization procedures 6. Importance of early diagnosis in preventing severe complications like amputation and cardiovascular events. 7. Understanding the role of multidisciplinary care in the management of such conditions.
7,10,40,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial40,Patient Information: Mr. Smith is a 68-year-old African American retired construction worker  who lives alone and hails from a relatively poor socio-economic background. He is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago but had a 30-pack year history  and a non-drinker.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Smith has reported experiencing severe pain in his lower left leg over the past three months  especially when walking short distances. The pain has been progressively increasing and disturbing his sleep lately. He also noticed his left foot turning colder compared to his right foot and discoloration over his left toes.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a long-standing history of uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. He has been following up with a primary care doctor regularly for these issues. His medications include Metformin 1000 mg twice a day and Losartan 50 mg once daily. He is not compliant with his medications and keeps skipping his glucose testing at home. He had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago  treated with coronary stenting.  Family History: His father died of heart disease in his 70's and his mother has a history of stroke in her late 60's. His elder brother has well-controlled diabetes and his younger sister has hypertension.  Physical Findings: On examination  Mr. Smith's lower left leg looked slim  pale  and glossy with noticeable absent hair distribution. His pulses in the left foot were absent. Distal foot was markedly colder than the right foot. Mr. Smith also shows the presence of a nonhealing ulcer on his left big toe.  In this case scenario  the primary findings and symptoms indicate that Mr. Smith is likely suffering from Critial Limb Ischemia  which needs immediate attention. Although other differentials should also be considered  his history of longstanding diabetes and hypertension alongside his symptoms lead us to this conclusion. Further diagnostic procedures should be initiated to confirm the diagnosis and plan for the necessary interventions.
7,10,41,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial41,Patient's Case:  Patient Demographics: Name: Jane Doe  Age: 72 years old  Gender: Female  Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired school principal  Residence Area: Suburban  Past Medical History: Jane has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which she takes appropriate medications. She had a myocardial infarction 10 years ago and subsequently underwent coronary artery stenting. Noteworthy  she is a 40-year pack-smoker  despite multiple attempts to quit. Jane has mild chronic kidney disease  but no known history of diabetes. She has intermittent claudication which was medically managed and she underwent right femoral artery angioplasty 5 years ago.   Key Complaints: Jane presents with a 3-week history of worsening pain in her left lower leg. She describes this pain as a constant throbbing pain  which intensifies when her leg is elevated and somewhat relieves when it is in a dependent position. The skin on her left leg and foot appears paler than that on the right leg  and lately  she is having trouble walking short distances due to severe pain. Jane reports that she has noticed an ulcer on her left great toe that is not healing despite proper care. She endorses feeling pulses 'disappear' occasionally in her left foot. No fever or chills. No history of trauma to the leg. The rest of the review systems was non-contributory.  This concise training case will help medical students discuss the assessment and management of critical limb ischemia. The escalating symptoms including rest pain  impaired color and temperature  presence of foot ulcer and diminished pulses make critical limb ischemia a likely diagnosis. Furthermore  Jane's smoking history  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and previous history of angioplasty make her a quintessential candidate for peripheral artery disease  which further precipitates the condition. This case can guide a fruitful discussion about the pathophysiology  risk factors  clinical presentations  diagnosis  and management of critical limb ischemia.
7,10,42,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial42,Case Report - Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: Mr. Morris  67-year-old Caucasian male.  Residence: Suburban community in Denver  Colorado.   Occupation: Recently retired office clerk.  Past Medical History: Patient has a significant history of Type II diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 12 years prior  managed with Metformin and regular insulin administration. He has a 40-pack-year smoking history  having quit 5 years prior. He also has a known history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both well-managed with medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin). Mr. Morris underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 3 years ago due to a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease.  Key Complaints: His chief complaints include persistent pain in his left lower limb  particularly the foot. The pain intensifies when he walks short distances or at night  disrupting his sleep. He also complains of a non-healing ulcer about 1 inch in diameter on his left heel that appeared 3 weeks ago.  Physical Examination: Presence of absent distal pulses in the lower extremities. His left foot displays signs of discoloration  with bluish-purple areas and is cool to touch. The ulcer on his heel is clean but deep with no signs of infection. There are no palpable pedal pulses in the left foot.  It is essential in this case to further investigate the possible diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. Given the patient's medical history and current symptoms  his risk factors include Diabetes Mellitus  a smoking history  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and past evidence of arterial disease (CABG). This makes the case suited for teaching medical students about early identification  diagnosis  and management of critical limb ischemia.
7,10,43,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial43,Case Profile:  Patient Demographics:   Mr. John Doe  a 68 year old male  from a non-Hispanic white background  resident of suburban Dallas  Texas.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and peripheral arterial disease  which have been managed medicinally for the past 15 years. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history and quit 2 years ago. He does not have a history of coronary artery disease  stroke  or any known chronic lung disease.  Key complaints:  Mr. Doe presented with a history of severe pain in his left lower leg that has been escalating over the last 3 weeks. He initially felt the pain during activity (walking or climbing stairs)  but recently it has been bothering him even at rest. He also mentioned experiencing intermittent mild pain in the right leg. He described the pain as a deep  intense ache that feels like a cramp and is usually felt in the calf muscle  though it sometimes occurs in the foot or thigh.  In the past week  he started noticing non-healing ulcers on his left foot. Upon further questioning  he also acknowledged experiencing mild numbness in the left foot. He has not experienced similar symptoms in the right foot. He does not have any symptoms of claudication.  Mr. Doe has not experienced any chest pain  shortness of breath  or any other cardiac complaints. His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.    Upon physical examination  the left foot appeared pale and cold to touch  and distal pulses were not palpable. Doppler ultrasound of the leg revealed severely reduced blood flow.  This case is suggestive of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood-flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed beyond intermittent claudication. 
7,10,44,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial44,Title: Critical Limb Ischemia in an Elderly Diabetic Patient   Patient Demographics:  Name: Uncleared for confidentiality Age: 68 years old Gender: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired Industrial Worker Residence: Urban  Past Medical History: The patient has a known 15-year history of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus. Comorbid conditions include poorly controlled hypertension and a 10-year history of hyperlipidemia. The patient is a former smoker  with a 30-pack-year history  having quit 5 years ago. He also has peripheral artery disease (PAD). There is no known history of heart disease or stroke.  Key Complaints: The patient presents with severe  constant pain in his lower right leg  even when at rest. The pain often worsens at night  and he reports disturbed sleep due to the pain. He also describes the pain as being relieved upon lowering the limb.   Signs of non-healing wounds are visible on his right foot. The patient also mentioned intermittent claudication  characterized by pain in his leg and discomfort when walking which subsides while at rest. Few days prior to the visit  the patient observed that his right lower leg and foot became cold and colorless. In the duration of one week  he noticed progressive deterioration of the condition with increasing pain  numbness  and an appearance of non-healing ulcers on the foot.  More recently  the patient reported an unintentional loss of weight and decreased appetite  which have persisted for the past two months.  The critical limb ischemia training case study is designed as such to shed light on the common clinical presentation  the importance of patient's past medical history  key complaints and the methods of diagnosing and treating the condition. The association of critical limb ischemia with diabetes  peripheral arterial disease  and other comorbid conditions  as well as its debilitating consequences such as non-healing ulcers and rest pain  lays emphasis on the need for early recognition and appropriate management.
7,10,45,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial45,Case:  Mr. Roberto Garcia is a 72-year-old male patient from a Hispanic background who presents with complaints of significant pain in his right lower extremity  exacerbated by movements and activities. The pain has increased in severity and frequency over the past four months and is persistent to the point that it disturbs his sleep and limits his daily activities. He mentions that the pain does subside slightly when he hangs his leg off the side of his bed. He also mentions the presence of non-healing sores on his foot and lower leg.  In terms of past medical history  Mr. Garcia has been a Type II Diabetic for the past 15 years  requiring oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has hypertension  managed with a beta-blocker and a thiazide diuretic  and moderate chronic kidney disease. Mr. Garcia is a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  but smoked a pack a day for about 35 years.  He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases.   Through this case scenario  we will discuss with medical students the complexity of critical limb ischemia's diagnosis  its pathophysiology  and management strategies  focusing on the care of patients with multiple comorbidities. The students will also learn the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and patient-centered care in managing such patients.
7,10,46,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial46,Patient Information:   Mr. William Brown  a 72-year-old African-American male is presented today.  Previous Medical History:   Reported medical history involves high blood pressure and chronic smoking. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 15 years ago which is currently uncontrolled. He also has degenerative joint disease and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) which was managed with lifestyle modifications and medications.  Presenting Complaints:   Mr. Brown comes in today complaining of severe pain in his lower extremities  primarily in his left foot. The pain has been persistent for two weeks now and is more severe when he attempts to walk or climb stairs but alleviates when he is rested. He mentions that the pain often wakes him up in the middle of the night. Recently  he has noticed bluish discoloration of his left foot along with cold sensation to touch. He has also observed small non-healing ulcers on his left heel and over the big toe. He has not noticed any swelling or redness but reports feeling a decrease in the sensation of his left leg.  This case should then continue with further diagnosis  examination  procedures  and ultimately  discussions regarding the management of the patient’s condition.
7,10,47,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial47,Patient Demographics: Name: John Doe Age: 66 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer Residence: Urban  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: Diagnosed 10 years ago; on regular medication. 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed 15 years ago  poorly managed  on insulin therapy. 3. Smoker: 20 cigarettes/day over the past 30 years  currently trying to quit but struggling with withdrawal. 4. Dyslipidemia: Under treatment for high cholesterol and triglyceride levels for the past 5 years.   Key Complaints: John presented with complaints of severe rest pain in the right leg for the past two weeks  which is more pronounced at night and has resulted in disturbed sleep. He describes it as a constant aching and burning sensation in the calf muscles. He also remarked on noticing a non-healing wound on the toes of the right foot with a blackish discoloration of the skin surrounding it.  About a month ago  John noticed occasional pain in his right calf while walking  which got relieved by rest. He initially ignored it thinking it was due to age. Over the past few weeks  the pain started occurring even during rest and considerably increased in intensity.   Additional Observations: On physical examination:  - Palpable pulses absent in the right foot. - Skin became cool  discolored  and pale in lower extremities. - Non-healing wound with necrotic areas observed on the toes of the right foot. - Right leg hair loss and brittle toenails were noted.  Conclusion: The above symptoms  signs and the past medical history strongly suggest Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  the severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Further investigations with Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  Doppler ultrasonography  Angiography  etc.  are required to confirm the diagnosis and plan the treatment accordingly.
7,10,48,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial48,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: Mr. Lambert is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired military personnel  residing in Oregon with his wife.  Past Medical History: Mr. Lambert has a long history of type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension  both controlled with medication for the past 15 years. He is a former smoker with a 40 pack-years history and quit smoking five years ago. He also underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for Ischemic Heart Disease ten years ago. He follows up regularly with his cardiologist and primary care physician.  Key Complaints: For the past six months  Mr. Lambert has been experiencing progressive pain in his right lower extremity. The pain initially started when walking  but now it has begun to trouble him at rest too. Over the past two weeks  he has also noticed some non-healing sores on his right foot. He denies experiencing chest pain or breathlessness  recent vision changes  or uncontrolled blood glucose level. Recently he has been waking up in the middle of the night due to severe pain in his right foot. The pain momentarily eases when he dangles his leg off the bed.  Upon examination  notable findings were weak to even absent distal pulses  coldness of the right foot  reduced sensation  observable pallor upon leg elevation  and a noticeable dark wound on the dorsal side of the right foot. Based on initial findings  a working diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia of the right lower extremity was made.   This case represents classic signs of advanced peripheral artery disease  also termed critical limb ischemia. This diagnosis has severe implications if left unchecked or untreated  possibly resulting in amputation of affected limbs or dire cardiovascular events. It is important for medical students to familiarize themselves with recognizing and managing this condition as they progress into their clinical years and beyond. 
7,10,49,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial49,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Demographics: - Patient's Name: Mr. X - Age: 70 years old - Sex: Male - Race: African-American - Occupation: Retired government official  Past Medical History: Mr. X is known to have chronic medical conditions including Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  which have been managed well with medication for the past 15 years. He quit smoking approximately 10 years ago after a 30-year pack history but does not have a history of hyperlipidemia. He has no history of diseases like chronic kidney disease or cerebrovascular accidents. There is a history of peripheral artery disease diagnosed two years ago. He neither consumes alcohol nor has a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Presenting Complaints: 1. He reports a 6-month history of gradually progressive  dull and aching pain in his left lower limb which is often precipitated by walking short distances and relieved by rest. This has started limiting his daily activities.  2. He reports experiencing pain in the left foot at rest  which has intensified over the past few days affecting his sleep. He describes the pain as a constant  sharp and burning sensation  which gets worse at night. 3. He also notes non-healing sores on the toes of his left foot.  4. Recent noticeable change- His left foot often feels cold  while the right foot feels normal  prompting his visit to the clinic.  This case presentation introduces Mr. X  an elderly diabetic and hypertensive patient suffering from progressive rest pain  non-healing wounds on the foot  and decreased temperature in the foot indicating the presence of critical limb ischemia. The students are expected to discuss the possible approach  differential diagnosis  necessary investigations  and management strategies of this critical condition contributing to significant morbidity and mortality.
7,10,50,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial50,Patient Presentation: A 70-year-old  African-American male presents to the emergency department with chronic  progressive pain in his lower right leg which has significantly increased over the past week. He reports that he has had difficulty walking due to the pain and has also begun to feel a constant cold sensation in the same area. Upon examination  the soles of both feet show ulcers and there is an absence of pulse in the right leg.  Patient Demographics: The patient is a retired construction worker. He lives alone  is widowed  and has three adult children who live out-of-state. He reports being a smoker for the past 50 years and drinks alcohol more than five times a week. His diet mainly consists of meat and processed food  and he neglects vegetable and fruit intake.   Past Medical History: The patient has a significant medical history for cardiovascular disease with a myocardial infarction occurring 10 years ago  and he had an angioplasty carried out at that time. Other than this  he has a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and hypertension for which he takes medication sporadically. He admits non-adherence to his medications mainly because he forgets doses and sometimes cannot afford to refill his prescriptions. He also admits to neglecting his diabetic diet and exercise plan recommended by his primary care physician.  Key Complaints: The main concerns include an escalating pain in the lower right leg  particularly when walking  the development ulceration on the soles of both feet  and the constant cold sensation in his right leg. This has caused a substantial reduction in his mobility and independence which is aggravating his underlying depression.

Present Complaints: The patient reported increasing pain in her left leg for a few weeks. She mentioned that the pain worsens when she walks or engages in any form of physical activity  though it tends to lessen while resting. She also complained about some degree of numbness and a consistent feeling of cold in her left lower limb. Mrs. K also indicated that she noticed a small non-healing wound on her left foot.  Past Medical History: She has a documented history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (managed with metformin) for the past decade. She also has a history of Hypertension (on Lisinopril) and Hyperlipidemia (managed with Simvastatin). Mrs. K quit smoking a year ago after a 30-year smoking history of one pack/day.  Social History: The patient lives with her husband  who is a retired police officer. She retired 10 years ago. They enjoy moderately active lifestyles  often participating in community activities and gardening.  Family History: The patient mentioned that her father had a history of Coronary Artery Disease and died from a Myocardial Infarction at age 80. Her mother died of colorectal cancer at age 76. She has a younger brother (72 years old) diagnosed with Peripheral Artery Disease.  Based on the patient's reported symptoms  demographic information  lifestyle  existing comorbidities  and family history  it is crucial to investigate the possibility of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which notably reduces blood flow to the extremities and can lead to amputation if not treated promptly. 
7,10,52,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial52,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischaemia  Patient Profile: Name: John Doe Age: 63 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Factory Worker   Past Medical History: 1. Type II Diabetes Mellitus for 15 years  with the slightly irregular follow-up appointment and insulin-dependent. 2. Hypertension for 10 years  managing with antihypertensives: Amlodipine 5mg daily. 3. Mild obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 32. 4. History of smoking for 30 years  but quit five years ago. 5. Previous Myocardial infarction 3 years ago  treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 6. Routine medications include insulin  amlodipine  and aspirin.  Key Complaints: The patient presented to the emergency department with a complaint of progressive intense pain in his right lower limb  primarily in the foot  that was worse at night and often disturbed his sleep. He also noticed the development of unhealing ulcers on his foot and coldness of the foot compared to the other foot. Despite the discomfort  he had noticed gradually he'd been moving it less and less over the last few weeks due to increased pain upon movement.   The patient also reported weight loss but denied any fever  chest pain  dizziness  or breathlessness. Intermittent claudication was also reported by the patient  typically after walking a few blocks.   No history of trauma or any similar incidents in the past were reported. The patient is a frequent traveler  his recent travel including prolonged flights. The diet was moderately balanced  although he expressed difficulty keeping his blood sugars in control.  The patient is rightly anxious about these symptoms and tends to his primary care provider. This case is designed to enable medical students to grasp the comprehensive approach to diagnosing and managing critical limb ischemia  which goes hand in hand with ruling out differentials  understanding the disease etiology  learning about risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension  and the importance of lifestyle factors such as smoking  diet  and exercise.
7,10,53,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial53,Case Report  Patient Information:   Mr. Williams is a 68-year-old African American male with a BMI of 30 kg/m2. The patient is a retired construction worker and lives with his wife. He's a former smoker with a pack history of 35 years  having quit about ten years ago. He does not consume alcohol and has no allergies.  Past Medical History:   The patient has a significant past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus for over fifteen years  and hypertension for twenty years. Additionally  he's had hyperlipidemia for about ten years and is under medication. He underwent coronary artery bypass surgery eight years ago due to coronary artery disease.  Chief Complaints:  Mr. Williams presents with a 3-week duration of worsening right lower limb pain at rest  non-healing ulcers on his right foot  and noticeable color change to a dusky hue. He also mentions that his foot often feels cold  and there's an associated noticeable decrease in hair growth. His pain significantly intensifies when his leg is elevated  especially at night  disturbing his sleep.  His wife reports noticing him walking with a limp  revealing symptoms of claudication with pain after walking a short distance. They report no trauma or injury to his foot. The chronic nature of these symptoms  accompanied by an inspection of the ischemic ulcers and the rest-pain indicates possible critical limb ischemia requiring immediate evaluation.  
7,10,54,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial54,Patient Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. William Thompson Age: 68 years Gender: Male Occupation: Retired Accountant Ethnicity: Caucasian Marital Status: Married  Past Medical History: 1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus – Diagnosed 15 years ago  well-managed on oral hypoglycemic medications. 2. Hypertension – Diagnosed 10 years ago  well-controlled on antihypertensive medications. 3. Previous smoker – Smoked one pack per day from age 18 to 55  quit smoking due to the development of mild Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).   4. Mild Obesity – Body Mass Index (BMI) 31.   Key Complaints: Mr. Thompson visited his primary care provider with the chief complaints of persistent  severe pain in his right lower leg for the past 3 weeks. The pain was initially intermittent and only appeared after walking a certain distance (claudication)  but recently it has stayed even while resting and is significantly affecting his sleep.   He described the pain as a deep  stabbing sensation in his calf muscle. He also reported that his right foot felt noticeably colder and appeared paler than the left one. He noticed a non-healing ulcer on his right big toe about a month ago.   He has no complaints of chest pain  palpitations  breathlessness  cough  or loss of consciousness. He has been adhering to his medication schedules and has not noticed any significant change in his dietary habits  physical activity level  or weight during this period.    This case study  on brief review  seems to suggest a clinical scenario of critical limb ischemia secondary to peripheral artery disease (PAD)  a common complication in patients with longstanding diabetes and hypertension. The non-healing ulcer  persistent pain even during rest  and the coldness and paleness of the foot are key early signs of CLI. The next steps would likely consist of a thorough physical examination  further investigation involving noninvasive vascular studies  and angiography if indicated. Appropriate therapy would be determined based on the severity and extent of the disease. 
7,10,55,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial55,Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired school teacher  living in a suburban community with his wife.  Chief Complaint: The patient presents with severe  constant rest pain in his left lower limb that is worse at night. The pain has significantly disturbed his sleep pattern  and he notes it is somewhat alleviated when he dangles his leg off the side of the bed. He also complains of non-healing ulcers on his left foot.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 15 years  which is controlled by oral hypoglycemic agents. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed by prescribed medication. Forty years ago  he was a daily smoker but quit 10 years ago. The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 8 years back for ischemic heart disease. After the surgery  he adhered to a cardiac rehabilitation program and performs regular aerobic exercises.  Family History: His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 84. His mother had a stroke at 80 and passed away two years later. One of his two brothers also has a history of coronary artery disease and his sister is diabetic.  Social History: The patient lives with his wife  who is his primary caretaker. He has two children  both are healthy. He does not consume alcohol or use illicit drugs. He has a health-conscious diet following his heart surgery.  Review of Systems: He notes severe left lower extremity pain that is not relieved by OTC pain medication. He also admits to having an ulcer on his left foot that has not improved over the past three weeks despite regular dressing and cleaning. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  dizziness  headaches or fever. There is no significant weight loss reported.  The described scenario forms a typical base for a case of critical limb ischemia. The next steps would typically involve a physical examination  appropriate diagnostic workup  and formulation of a management plan. The management plan should ideally take into consideration both medical and surgical options  if necessary.
7,10,56,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial56,Patient Information: Mrs. D  a 70-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher  living with her husband in a suburban neighborhood.  Primary Complaints: She presents with non-healing ulcers on the left foot coupled with severe pain in the foot  even at rest. She reports the pain has been increasing gradually over the past several weeks  making it increasingly difficult to walk or even sleep comfortably at night. Notably  she also mentions a sudden loss of sensation in the foot over the past few days.  Past Medical History: Mrs. D has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) duly managed with oral hypoglycaemic drugs for the last 15 years; she is also hypertensive  on medication for the past 10 years. Additionally  she has a history of smoking  though she quit 5 years ago. She was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) 3 years back.  Family History: There is a positive family history of DM and coronary artery disease in her parents.   Diagnosis: Given the above data  the presenting complaints are suggestive of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  a serious form of PAD  where there is a dramatically reduced blood flow to the extremities  causing severe pain  non-healing ulcers  or even gangrene.  The scenario emphasis the importance of managing cardiovascular risk factors to prevent severe complications like CLI. Further  it highlights the need for multidisciplinary collaboration in the management of such patients  including primary care physicians  vascular surgeons  and podiatrists.
7,10,57,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial57,Case Report on Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 68 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Civil Engineer  Past Medical History Mr. Doe has a distinguished history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 12 years. He is also hypertensive  presenting uncontrolled blood pressure values over the past 6 months. He is a former smoker who quit ten years ago after a 30-year history of tobacco use which averaged to a pack a day. His records also show hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol levels). He had a stroke 7 years ago  with no residual deficits. No known allergies on his records. Mr. Doe follows up regularly with his primary care physician and endocrinologist  where he's been compliant with medications and lifestyle modifications.  Key Complaints Mr. Doe has noticed worsening pain in his left leg over the past 6 months  which initially occurred after walking for a certain distance  but now has started to pain even at rest. He describes it as a constant cramping and burning sensation which intensifies at night  making his sleep quality poor. Recently  the pain is accompanied by numbness and a sense of coldness. There are no ulcers or sores on his lower left leg  but he has mentioned that it takes a longer time for even minor injuries to heal on the said leg. He acknowledges a significant reduction in physical activity due to the pain  affecting his overall quality of life.  The above details have been carefully put together to provide medical students with a clinically relevant scenario of a patient with likely peripheral artery disease (PAD) progressing into critical limb ischemia (CLI). The risk factors in the patient's history and his current complaints should lead one to consider the possibility of CLI which can guide further investigations.
7,10,58,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial58,Case Report - Critical Limic Ischemia  Patient Information:   Mr. K  a 68-year-old African-American male  presented to the outpatient clinic. He is a retired construction worker  lives with his wife  and is the primary caregiver to his 5-year old grandson. He is a non-smoker and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History:  His past medical history is significant for type II diabetes mellitus (DM) diagnosed 13 years ago and high blood pressure (HBP) diagnosed 8 years ago  for which he has been taking metformin and losartan  respectively. He has been diagnosed with dyslipidaemia for 5 years and is on 20 mg of atorvastatin daily. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and had a stent placed 7 years ago. He has no known drug allergies. There is a family history of CAD and type II DM.  Chief Complaints:  Mr. K reported the progressive onset of pain in his right leg over the past 6 months. The pain has gradually worsened and has started to interfere with his daily activities. Initially  the pain only developed when walking more than 3 blocks and was relieved with rest (claudication). Recently  the pain has become persistent  even during rest. It's particularly severe in his right foot  and he described it as a sharp  burning sensation that worsens when he elevates his foot and improves when he dangles it over the side of his bed.  He has also noticed skin color changes on his right foot  and ulcers have developed on two of his toes. The patient has experienced a significant decrease in his ability to perform daily activities due to the pain and often has to wake up at night due to intense discomfort. He also mentioned the deterioration of his right foot's temperature  describing it as 'cold to touch' sometimes.  He has previously consulted with his primary care physician and was provided with pain medications  advice to keep the foot elevated  and an antibiotics prescription due to the ulcers. Despite this  the symptoms have persisted  and his condition has worsened  leading to his referral to the vascular clinic.   These symptoms and findings are highly suggestive for critical limb ischemia in the patient  necessitating further diagnostic evaluation and treatment considerations.
7,10,59,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial59,"Patient Information:   Mr. Jorge Martinez  a 65-year-old Hispanic male  presents with a significant complaint of chronic pain in his left lower leg  particularly in the calf region.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Martinez has a previous 20-year history of type 2 diabetes that has been moderately controlled with medication. He is a long-term smoker  having smoked half a pack a day for thirty years  but quite last year upon doctors' advice. He also has hypertension for which he is on low-dose medication. Five years ago  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease  but was asymptomatic until now. His family history is notable for a father with early onset coronary artery disease and a mother with stroke. He has no known allergies to any food  medicines or environmental elements.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Martinez reports intense and continuous pain in his left leg that began over six months ago  which worsens while lying down  making it difficult for him to find a comfortable sleeping position. His pain is relieved when he hangs his leg over the edge of the bedside. Over this period  he has noticed a progressive change in the color of his leg skin  from regular flesh-tone to a shiny pallor and overall coolness to the touch. He also complains of hair loss on the left leg. His toenails have thickened and he has lost almost all sense of touch in his feet.  For the past two months  the pain intensity elevated  now making it difficult for him to walk even short distances  which he refers to as """"claudication"""". The most alarming change Mr. Martinez reports is the development of a non-healing ulcer on his left big toe  which is not responding to local treatments.  Summary:  All of these findings suggest a case of critical limb ischemia (CLI)  most likely as a result of uncontrolled peripheral artery disease  long-term smoking history  and diabetes. Further evaluation and intervention are deemed necessary to preserve the patient's limb and quality of life."
7,10,60,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial60,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics:  Ms. Jane Doe  65-year-old Caucasian female  retired teacher from a urban setting.  Past medical history: - Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (15 years ago) - Hypertension (High blood pressure) - Hyperlipidemia (High cholesterol) - Previous smoker  quit about 10 years ago - Family history of peripheral artery disease and stroke  Key Complaints: - Progressive  severe pain in her right lower leg and foot for the last 3 weeks - The pain intensifies upon elevation and decreases when dangling - Appearance of non-healing  small ulcers on the right lower leg and big toe - Reports of noticeable temperature difference between lower legs  with right one feeling significantly cooler - Decreased hair growth on right lower leg - Reported significant fatigue while doing regular activities  particularly walking.  Additional Information:  On further inquiry  Ms. Doe reported that she first started noticing intermittent discomfort in her leg while walking around a month ago. The pain she described was a muscle ache  similar to a cramp  usually triggered by activities and relieved by rest. However  the discomfort progressively worsened over the past 3 weeks evolving into persistent pain.  Note: This case exposes students to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  an advanced form of peripheral artery disease. Patient’s age  diabetic state  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking history increase her risk for developing CLI. The complaints align well with the symptoms of CLI  such as severe pain at rest  non-healing wounds  and lower-body fatigue. In this case  students should focus on recognizing symptoms  interpreting the patient's history  and ordering appropriate diagnostic tests  such as Ankle-brachial index  Doppler ultrasound  angiography  etc. Additionally  they should consider the potential need for consulting a vascular surgeon or initiating treatments like medication changes  angioplasty  stent  or bypass surgery  and understand the critical importance of addressing lifestyle factors.
7,10,61,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial61,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: Patient X is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes  Hypertension  and a 40-year pack history of smoking. He is a retired office worker and lives with his wife.  Presenting Complaint and History of Present Illness: Patient X presented with severe pain in his left lower extremity  rated at 8/10 on the pain scale which has been worsening over the 6 months. Additionally  the pain becomes significantly worse when he walks a short distance or while at rest especially during the night. The patient also complains of non-healing sores on his left foot. This has created a recent onset of sleeping difficulty for him.  Past Medical History: - Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Diagnosed 15 years ago  poorly controlled. - Hypertension: Diagnosed 8 years ago  controlled with medication. - No known allergies - Past surgical history is non-contributorial.  Family History: - Father: Late onset diabetes mellitus and passed away from a heart attack at the age of 72. - Mother: Deceased  history of Hypertension and Stroke. - Brothers (2) and Sister (1): Alive and with a history of Hypertension.  Social History:  - He has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. - Denies any use of alcohol or illicit drugs. - His diet is predominantly high carbohydrate and fat  low in fruit and vegetables.  Review of Systems: - General: Notable weight loss over the past six months. - Cardiovascular: Left leg pain worsens with movement  non-healing sores on foot. - Respiratory: No cough  no shortness of breath. - GI/GU: Normal. - Neuro: No history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks. Cognitive abilities are sound.  The primary suspicion from the initial patient presentation is Critical Limb Ischemia  largely due to his persistent and severe lower extremity pain  non-healing sores  and his significant history contributing to vascular disease. The next step in this case would involve diagnostic testing to confirm CLI. This case provides a foundation for teaching on key symptoms of CLI  associated risk factors  diagnosis  and management.
7,10,62,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial62,Patient Identity: Mr. Robert Johnson Age: 65 years Sex: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired navy officer  Presenting Complaint: The patient has been experiencing severe pain in his right lower leg for the past few months  which has intensified over the last week. The pain is often worse at night and seems to be unrelieved by rest.  Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a history of hypertension for 10 years and is under medication. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago  for which he is currently taking metformin. He has been a smoker for around 30 years but quit smoking a year ago. No prior history of surgeries. Last recorded body mass index (BMI) was 28.2.  Review of other organ systems: Unremarkable.  Family History: Both parents hypertensive and father had myocardial infarction at the age of 70. He has a younger brother who is diabetic.  Social History: He lives with his wife. He used to consume alcohol socially  but quit 2 years ago. He reports no illicit drug use.   Physical Examination: Upon inspection of the right leg  color changes are noticeable  with the skin appearing pale. The pulses in the right lower leg couldn't be palpated. The leg is colder compared to the left one and appears atrophic. Patient reported severe pain on passive motion. No visible sores or ulcers.  Given his history of diabetes  hypertension  and smoking  combined with his symptoms and physical examination  the medical students are to consider the possibility of Critical Limb Ischemia. The objective is to understand the associated risk factors  clinical features  diagnostic methods (like Ankle-Brachial Index  Doppler ultrasound  Angiography)  treatment options  and preventive measures for Critical Limb Ischemia.
7,10,63,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial63,Patient Information: Mrs. E. Smith  67 years old  Caucasian  weighs 75 kg  and is 160 cm tall resides in Simcoe County  Ontario  Canada. She is a retired pediatric nurse  a widow and mother of two adult kids. She is a nonsmoker but has a history of occasional alcohol consumption.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Smith has a chronic background of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 13 years and Hypercholesterolemia  both managed conservatively. Reports being compliant with her oral hypoglycemic therapy (Metformin) and cholesterol-lowering drugs (Statins).  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Smith has presented with gradually increasing pain in the left leg  primarily on walking short distances for the last 2 months. The pain is often described as severe  cramping  located in her calf muscle  and relieves on rest. Over recent weeks  she has also noticed pain in her leg at rest and at night which has disturbed her sleep.   On further inquiry  she reported noticeable slow wound healing and colder feet over the last month  particularly the left foot. She also expressed concerns about her left foot appearing slightly pale compared to the right one.  Note: This training case is an ideal opportunity to discuss the topic of peripheral arterial disease  specifically focusing on critical limb ischemia. Here  the intersection of diabetic vascular complications and the potential of limb-threatening ischemia can be explored in depth.
7,10,64,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial64,Patient Profile:   Name: Mr. Smith Age: 70 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a 30-year history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus  and a 40-year history of heavy tobacco use  although he quit smoking 10 years ago. He has been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia but has been inconsistent with his medication regime due to financial constraints. He underwent a right leg superficial femoral artery stent placement five years ago due to peripheral artery disease (PAD).  Presenting Complaints:  Over the past six months  Mr. Smith has been experiencing progressive pain in his left foot  initially only while walking  but now at rest as well. He describes the pain as a deep  burning sensation that especially disturbs his sleep. He has also noticed a slow healing wound on his left great toe. Recently  his left foot has become persistently colder compared to the right foot. He denied any chest pain  shortness of breath  or palpitations.  Key Points for Training:  This case is a good opportunity to teach medical students about the importance of recognizing critical limb ischemia (CLI)  which is a severe obstruction of the arteries  markedly reducing blood flow to the extremities and causing severe pain  even at rest. Its mention should trigger discussions around risk factors such as long-standing diabetes  smoking  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. The patient's previous PAD and stenting should also be emphasized.   The deep  burning rest pain  foot coldness  and non-healing wound are clear symptoms suggesting the progression of PAD towards CLI. Treatment involving lifestyle modifications  aggressive control of diabetes and hypertension  the use of antiplatelet and statin therapy  and potential endovascular or bypass surgical options should be discussed in relation to Mr. Smith's case. Prognosis and potential complications  including the risk of amputation and increased cardiovascular mortality  should be mentioned.   Furthermore  the case highlights the role that socioeconomic factors play in health outcomes  as Mr. Smith's non-adherence to prescribed treatment appears to be financially motivated—an essential discussion point on the impact of such determinants of health. 
7,10,65,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial65,Patient Information: Mr. James Wilson  a 69-year-old Caucasian male.  Past Medical History: Mr. Wilson has a significant history of type II diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. His surgical history includes a 5-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) performed 10 years ago. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years but quit after his CABG surgery. He is currently on insulin  metformin  aspirin  clopidogrel  and a statin.  Chief Complaint: Over the last six months  Mr. Wilson has been experiencing progressive pain in his right leg  especially when he walks. The pain usually begins in his calf and radiates down  sometimes all the way to his toes. He mentions that it seems to be relieved by rest. However  he notes that lately  he has been experiencing pain even when he is not walking  and is often awakened by it during the night.  Key Concerns: The pain itself is not the only issue. Due to pain  his walking distance has markedly decreased over time. Recently  he’s been experiencing coldness in his foot and has noticed that the color of his foot changes to a pale shade  especially when it hangs down. Since last week  he has also noticed a non-healing small ulcer over his great toe. He is increasingly concerned about the worsening symptoms. His blood sugar control has been fairly stable  and there is no history of any recent chest pain  dyspnea or syncopal episodes.
7,10,66,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial66,"Patient Information:   Mrs. Maria Gonzales is a 68-year-old Hispanic woman living in Santa Monica  California. She is a retired schoolteacher  non-smoker  with a history of moderate alcohol consumption. Her BMI is 28.5.   Past Medical History:   Mrs. Gonzales has a documented history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years and has been non-compliant with her diet and medications. She was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago  which is controlled with medications. Five years ago  she suffered from a myocardial infarction and was managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There is a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in her family.  Present Complaints:  She came to the clinic today complaining of excruciating """"burning"""" pain in her right lower limb  particularly the foot  which worsens at night. She noticed a non-healing wound on her right forefoot that occasionally discharges pus. She reports difficulty walking distances she used to cover easily due to leg fatigue and discomfort. There has been an increasing reliance on her daughter to help her with daily chores and personal grooming due to her leg symptoms. Mrs. Gonzales has also noted the progressive change of her foot's skin color  turning more bluish and feeling cold to touch.  These symptoms suggest critical limb ischemia (CLI)  an emergency form of peripheral artery disease. This case encourages medical students to consider a diagnosis and plan appropriate management."
7,10,67,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial67,Patient Information:  Mr. Samuel Jacobson  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  Past Medical History: The patient is diagnosed with Type-2 Diabetes for the last 15 years  and Hyperlipidemia for the last ten years. The patient is also a pack a day smoker for 45 years. There is no past surgical history. No known allergies have been reported. The patient's daily medications include Metformin  Atorvastatin  and a low-dose Aspirin.  Chief complaints: The patient arrived at the outpatient clinic with a 6 week history of worsening pain in the right calf  which he described as deep  hollow  and persistently aching. The pain was graded at 4-6/10 and was specifically reported to be more pronounced during walks and relieved by rest.  The patient also reported a single non-healing ulcer on the right big toe which had been present for almost one month. He noticed increasing discoloration surrounding the wound and complained of experiencing coldness in the right lower limb.  Upon physical examination  his right pedal pulse was not palpable  and the lower limb appeared pale with delayed capillary refill - indicators of insufficient blood supply (ischemia).  This case of Mr. Samuel Jacobson can be utilized to discuss Critical Limb Ischemia  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores. As it is the most advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  detailed patient history  clinical signs and symptoms  and relevant diagnostic tests can be elaborated upon. Early recognition  timely endovascular treatment/Surgical revascularization  and risk factor management discussions based on this case will provide valuable insights into medical students.
7,10,68,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial68,Case Report  Patient Information Mr. LJ  a 72-year-old African American male truck driver  presents himself to the outpatient department.  Chief Complaints The patient reports experiencing rest pain in his right lower limb  particularly when lying down. He also mentions having difficulty in walking due to muscle cramps in the same leg. Further  he reports new non-healing wounds on his right foot.  Past Medical History The patient has a historical record of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for over 20 years. He quit smoking five years back but smoked for 30 years  averaging a pack per day. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 6 years ago.  Family History His father died of stroke at the age of 70  and his mother died due to complications from diabetes mellitus at 60. He has one brother with early-onset CAD  who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting at the age of 55.  Social History The patient is married with three children and is currently living a sedentary lifestyle due to his profession. He rarely exercises and follows a diet high in fats and carbohydrates.  Examination Upon physical examination  the right foot is pale and cooler in comparison to the left one. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are absent on the right side. Capillary refill time is extended. There are two ulcers: one on the right big toe and the other on the heel  both characterized by black necrotic tissue at the center and a pale surrounding wound bed.  This case should lead to a discussion on the assessment  diagnosis  and management of Critical Limb Ischemia  focusing on the importance of aggressive management of risk factors  the usage of diagnostic tools like Doppler studies  angiography  and the relevance of revascularization techniques and amputation in severe cases. Additionally  the need for a multidisciplinary approach involving vascular surgeons  interventional radiologists  and wound care specialists should be emphasized. 
7,10,69,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial69,"Patient Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Demographics: Patient: Mr. John Doe Age: 68-year-old  Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired teacher Smoker: Yes  about 20 cigarettes a day for 45 years now  Medical History: - Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 12 years ago - Family history of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and cardiovascular disease - Had a heart bypass surgery 6 years ago - Hypertension for 15 years  Chief Complaint: - Mr. Doe talks about experiencing severe pain in his right calf muscle for the past two months - He claims the pain intensifies while walking and eases once he rests for a few minutes (classic claudication) - However  over the last week  he has been feeling the pain even while resting - Additionally  there's noticeable color change in the skin of his right foot  it appears paler compared to the left foot - He reports sleeping with his leg hanging off the bed to alleviate the discomfort - Complaints about """"pins and needles"""" sensation in his right foot - Patient also mentioned an unhealed wound had developed on his right foot for the past couple of weeks - Significant weight loss over the past few months  This case report thus provides an insight into a diabetic patient with progressive signs and symptoms of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Next steps in the patient's evaluation would include an objective assessment of the affected limb's perfusion status  imaging to evaluate and characterize the extent of arterial disease  and ultimately discussions about revascularization strategies balanced against the patient's overall health status."
7,10,70,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial70,Case Report:  Name: Mrs. Dolores Sanchez Age: 67 years Sex: Female Race: Hispanic  Occupation: Retired school teacher Location: Phoenix  Arizona  Past Medical History: Mrs. Sanchez has a 30-year history of Type 2 diabetes managed with Metformin. She is also a smoker for 40 years with a history of hypertension  hypercholesterolemia managed with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively. She had undergone bilateral total hip replacement due to severe osteoarthritis 5 years ago. No known drug allergies.   Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Sanchez has been experiencing chronic pain over the past two months in her left lower leg  particularly in the calf area  which escalates when she walks less than one block  leading to frequent rest breaks. She also reports that she has started feeling a constant ache at rest over the past week; pain sometimes wakes her up at night. She admits that there's noticeable cooling of the foot and a sore on her big toe that stubbornly isn't healing for over three weeks. No significant weight loss.  She has not had any trauma to the leg or any recent surgeries. She states she has been managing the pain at home with regular doses of acetaminophen but with increasing discomfort  she decided to seek immediate medical help.  She admits minimal alcohol use  does not do any illicit drugs but is a current smoker  1 pack/day. Her diet is largely home-cooked Hispanic foods  and she lives with her husband in their own house.   In this case  Mrs. Sanchez's age  history of smoking  and long-standing diabetes make her at higher risk for peripheral artery disease (PAD) and its complication known as Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Her symptoms such as the persistent pain at rest  noticeable cooling of the foot  and the non-healing wound are common signs of CLI. Medical students would be encouraged to understand how to manage her condition adequately and prevent further complications like limb loss.
7,10,71,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial71,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Mr. James Mitchell  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired factory worker  non-smoker  residing in Chapel Hill  North Carolina.  Past Medical History: Controlled hypertension for the last 12 years  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for 10 years with mixed control  and was treated for a myocardial infarction 5 years prior. Also a history of intermittent claudication for the past year.   Presenting Complaints: Over the last four weeks  Mr. Mitchell has been experiencing escalating right lower limb pain even while in rest. The pain is severe  especially during the night. He describes the pain as a burning  sharp sensation which intensifies when he elevates his limb. He shared that his foot often feels cold and numb  and he has noticed a change in skin color to a bluish  pale hue.   He also notified that he has difficulty walking short distances and has recently noticed a non-healing wound on his right big toe that has been present for two weeks.   This hypothetical patient's presentation is suggestive of critical limb ischemia secondary to peripheral arterial disease. The patient presents with typical symptoms including rest pain  non-healing wounds  and change in color/temperature due to a reduction in blood supply. His past medical history also puts him at high risk for this condition.  Note: This case is designed to prompt further evaluation and appropriate testing to confirm diagnosis  and to facilitate discussion around proper management and potential complications if left untreated.
7,10,72,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial72,Patient Case Report: Patient Demographics: - Name: Mr. John - Age: 68 years old - Gender: Male - Profession: Retired factory worker - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Location: Urban area   Past Medical History: - Diagnosed with Type-2 Diabetes 15 years ago - Known case of peripheral arterial disease diagnosed 3 years ago - Smoker  approximately 20 cigarettes per day for the last 40 years - Family history of cardiovascular disease  both parents  Key Complaints:  - Presented with rest pain in his left lower leg for the last two weeks - Pain is intense  often waking him up at night - Increasing pain upon walking even short distances  formerly manageable - Noted a blackened area on his big toe of the left foot recently  with surrounding skin being pale and shiny - He also complains of a constant cold feeling in the left lower limb - Significant unintentional weight loss over the last few months  due to loss of appetite  possibly related to chronic pain - He reported a few episodes of fainting in the past month  This case essentially highlights a patient who could be suffering from Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). Factors such as patient's age  smoking status  uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus  and history of Peripheral Arterial Disease make him susceptible. The symptoms of intense pain even at rest  changes in skin color  cold feet  and signs of gangrene demonstrate worsening of the previously diagnosed condition. Chronic CLI can cause extreme pain  leading to loss of appetite  weight loss  and even fainting. Hence  it is crucial for medical students to identify the urgency and severity of such vascular complications.
7,10,73,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial73,Patient Information:  Mr. Charles Rogers  a Caucasian male  aged 72 years  living in the suburbs of Chicago  Insurance holder.  Chief Complaints:  Recurrent pain in the right lower limb  particularly while walking  that gets somewhat better with rest (claudication). Recently  he observed ulcer formation and discoloration around his right foot.   Past medical history:  Mr. Rogers is a former smoker  having quit 10 years earlier after smoking a pack a day for several decades. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 15 years ago  which is currently managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He also suffers from chronic hypertension controlled through beta-blocker medication. He had a heart attack five years ago for which he underwent successful angioplasty and placement of a stent.  Social History: Mr. Rogers is a retired schoolteacher  living with his wife. He admits to having a fat-rich diet and sedentary lifestyle. He has two children who live in different states. He does not consume alcohol or use recreational drugs.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  the affected foot demonstrates pallor on elevation and dependent rubor (redness)  with non-healing ulcers on the toes. Distal pulses (posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis) in the right foot are not palpable. There is loss of hair on the lower part of the right leg.   Potential Learning Point for Medical students:  This case critically demonstrates signs symptomatic of Critical Limb Ischemia  including the patient's classic symptoms  risk factors and subsequent physical examination findings. Limb ischemia often presents in individuals suffering from peripheral artery disease- a disease exacerbated by diabetes  smoking  hyperlipidemia and hypertension. With Mr. Roger's background  understanding peripheral arterial disease's risk factors and its lethal complication  such as critical limb ischemia  can educate medical students on disease management and amputation prevention. 
7,10,74,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial74,Case Report for Critical Limb Ischemia Training:  Patient Information: Mr. Anderson is a 71-year-old African-American male  retired truck driver  with full insurance coverage  and hailing from Newark  New Jersey.  Medical History: Mr. Anderson has a long history of uncontrolled Type II Diabetes Mellitus for over 15 years  coupled with hyperlipidemia  hypertension  and myocardial infarction 5 years ago. He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking but quit smoking 4 years ago after the myocardial infarction. His father died of stroke and his mother had peripheral vascular disease. Mr. Anderson does not exercise regularly and mostly follows a high-fat diet.  Key Complaints: He visited the clinic with complaints of intermittent claudication for the past 6 months  which gradually worsened. He describes a severe cramping pain in his right calf  which occurs after walking for a few minutes and resolves with rest. Recently  the pain became persistent and started occurring at rest  which predominantly keeps him awake at night. He also noticed a non-healing ulcer on his right great toe for the past 8 weeks. Furthermore  he reports occasional dizziness and fatigue  as well as unusual coldness and color change in his foot. He denies chest pain and shortness of breath.  In summary  this case describes a patient with a high-risk profile: advanced age  long-standing uncontrolled diabetes  hyperlipidemia  hypertension  high-fat diet  sedentary lifestyle  smoking history  and a family history of vascular disease. The reported symptoms strongly suggest critical limb ischemia (CLI). This case is designed to demonstrate the importance of a comprehensive approach to patient's complaints and reminds to consider vascular causes for leg pain  especially in patients with significant risk factors. Further examination  labs  and imaging studies should be explored in the subsequent sessions to confirm the diagnosis and plan potential treatment.

He also reported occasional episodes of feeling cold in the affected leg and noticed that his leg appears slightly pale compared to the other one.  Summary: The given profile is a standard representation of a patient suffering from CLI. The use of this case would facilitate discussions regarding the importance of risk factors assessing  early diagnosis and proper management of critical limb ischemia. 
7,10,78,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial78,Case Report:  Patient Information:   Mr. Smith  a 71-year-old male  presents to the outpatient clinic. He is Caucasian and lives independently with his wife at their suburban home in the outskirts of Atlanta  Georgia. He's a retired high school teacher  trends towards a sedentary lifestyle  and has a 30-year history of pack-a-day smoking. The patient drinks alcohol socially with an average consumption of five units per week. He has a known history of Type 2 diabetes for 20 years and has been notified of elevated cholesterol levels in his recent past.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a 20-year history of Type 2 diabetes  which is reasonably controlled. He has been taking Metformin and Sulfonylureas  showing average fasting blood sugar 145-160 mg/dL and HbA1C 7.1. He also has a background of Hypercholesterolemia with a recent LDL cholesterol level of 155 mg/dl  despite being on Statins. He was diagnosed as hypertensive ten years ago and is using ACE inhibitors  maintaining blood pressure around 135/85 mmHg. He has not been diagnosed with any significant cardiac  respiratory  or kidney diseases. He has not had any surgical interventions in the past.   Key Complaints:  Mr. Smith reports that he has been experiencing increasing discomfort in his right leg over the past few months. The pain primarily shows up when he tries to walk more than half a block or climbs his house stairs. He finds relief in pain once he's at rest. Once he sits or stops walking  the pain goes away after a few minutes. He also mentions that the past few weeks  he’s noticed that his right foot appears slightly discolored—paler than his left foot. When asked  he notes that his right foot seems colder than the other one.  NOTE: This case focuses on critical limb ischemia (CLI)  which is a severe obstruction of the arteries that significantly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores. The patient's history reveals multiple risk factors for peripheral artery disease  which includes age (over 70)  male gender  smoking history  diabetes  hypercholesterolemia  and hypertension. Thus leading into the discussion for CLI.
7,10,79,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial79,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: Mr. John Lucas  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired truck driver.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Lucas came to the hospital reporting a two-month history of severe  persistent pain at rest in the lower left leg  particularly in the foot. He also complained about non-healing ulcers on his left foot  progressive muscle weakness  and fatigue.  Past Medical History:  1) Hypertension - He has been on amlodipine 5mg daily for the past eight years. 2) Type 2 diabetes mellitus - Diagnosed ten years ago  managed by metformin 500mg twice daily and regular dietary controls. 3) Smoking history - He quit smoking five years ago after a 40-year-long smoking history. 4) No known drug allergies.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  it was noted that the patient's left foot was notably cooler than his right foot. Pulses (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial) were unpalpable in the lower left leg. There was evidence of distal gangrene on two toes of the left foot  along with multiple non-healing ulcerations.  Risk Factors: History of smoking  hypertension  and diabetes are significant risk factors in Mr. Lucas' case for the development of peripheral artery disease (PAD) leading to critical limb ischemia (CLI).  This case can be used to teach medical students about how to diagnose and manage patients with CLI  emphasizing the role of medical history and physical examinations in identifying high-risk patients. The lessons can include discussions on the pertinent medical therapy  surgical options depending on the condition  and the importance of lifestyle modifications aimed at symptom management and slowing disease progression. Additionally  the psychosocial impacts of CLI should be considered  and the critical need for a multidisciplinary approach to patient care can be emphasized. 
7,10,80,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial80,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  The subject is a 67-year-old Caucasian male  a retired truck driver  and a current resident of Dallas  Texas.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a 25-year history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 20-pack-year history of smoking. He had been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) about three years ago but failed to follow up on the appropriate treatment.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of severe rest pain in the left lower extremity  particularly focused in the calf and foot. He described the pain as aching and said it worsened at night. He also noted that the pain frequently awakened him from sleep  was exacerbated by elevation of the limb  and alleviated with hanging the foot over the side of the bed. The patient also reported progressive weakness in his left leg and was experiencing difficulty when walking. Over the last day  he noticed the foot has turned pale and cool  with a non-healing ulcer in the great toe.  Upon physical examination  the left foot was noticeably colder than the right one  and both pedal and posterior tibial pulses were absent. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.3 on the left compared to 0.9 on the right. The skin of the left foot showed signs of atrophy and shiny texture. A painful ulcer approximately 2 cm in diameter was noticed on the left great toe with necrotic base and surrounding erythema  suggestive of critical limb ischemia.  Based on these symptoms  diagnostic tests were suggested  including Doppler ultrasound  angiography  and blood tests for complete blood count  glucose  creatinine  lipids  and coagulation tests  to further investigate his condition. The patient gives consent to proceed with diagnostic investigations followed by revascularization intervention.  This case report is intended for medical students to help in understanding the pathophysiology  diagnosis and management of critical limb ischemia in patients with underlying peripheral arterial diseases  especially those with comorbidities/non-compliance increasing their risk and worsening the prognosis.

He resides in Atlanta  Georgia and is married with three adult children. He is generally independent in his daily activities and is a non-smoker. However  he has a history of heavy alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 15 years and has been on Metformin. He also has a history of Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia  both managed with medications  and had a transient ischemic attack 5 years ago. Last year  he underwent coronary angioplasty for stable angina  with significant improvement in symptoms.  Key Complaints: Mr. Smith has been facing difficulty in walking for the past 6 months. He complains of a severe burning and cramping pain in his right calf that becomes worse when walking and eases when he stops – a condition termed as 'intermittent claudication.' Recently he noticed that the foot was cooler than the left foot. He also reports rest pain at night  persistent numbness  and tingling. Additionally  he pointed out a couple of non-healing sores on his toes. He also noted reduced hair growth on his lower legs. He has not experienced any fever  chills  or other systemic symptoms.  These symptoms suggest possible Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities and has progressed to the point of severe pain and skin ulcers or sores. The patient's risk factors including the history of diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and advanced age make this a prime consideration.  NOTE: Physical examination  investigations  differential diagnoses  and management strategies would be discussed subsequent to the case presentation as part of interactive teaching and learning.

He used to be a smoker  but stopped 10 years ago. He underwent heart bypass surgery 5 years ago.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. Johnson presents to the Emergency Department complaining of persistent and severe pain in his left lower leg that started several weeks ago. He mentions that the pain increases when he's lying down  and eases a bit when he dangles his leg over the side of the bed.   He reports that his left foot is colder than the right and he has noticed a gradual discoloration in the affected limb  becoming more pale and bluish.   Upon physical examination  noticeable signs include dry and scaly skin  diminished hair growth on the left leg  and weak or absent pulses in the left foot. Mr. Johnson also indicates that he has difficulty in walking due to the pain  and the foot ulcers he have had for a month aren't healing.  Based on these observations  a preliminary diagnosis of critical limb ischemia is suspected.
7,10,83,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial83,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia   Patient Demographics: The patient is a 69-year-old African American male  Mr. Johnson  living in an urban environment. He is a retired military officer and a smoker of 45 years. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  married with three children  and lives a sedentary lifestyle.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a longstanding history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN). He is on Metformin for DM and a calcium channel blocker for HTN. There is also a history of obstructive sleep apnea for which he uses CPAP at night.  Key Complaints: Mr. Johnson has visited the emergency department due to persistent severe pain in his right lower limb that is greatly intensified on walking  leading to an inability to complete a short distance. He describes the nature of the pain as a burning and throbbing sensation that never completely subsides  but gets worse when he lies down. He also mentions experiencing intermittent claudication for the past few months.   Upon examination  the right lower limb is noticeably cooler than the rest of the body  with a diminished distal pulse. The skin is slightly discolored and shiny  with the presence of some non-healing ulcers on the foot.  The patient has been taking over-the-counter pain medication to relieve the pain but it is no longer working effectively. He also mentions that he has lost some weight over the past month due to decreased appetite.  This information points towards a potential case of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  requiring prompt investigation and treatment to prevent the progression of the disease.
7,10,84,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial84,Patient Information: Mr. Johnson  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  retired truck driver.  Past Medical History: The patient has a 20-year history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  well controlled with metformin  and a 30-year pack history of smoking  quit 5 years ago. He has a known history of peripheral artery disease  diagnosed approximately 3 years ago. He has hypertension  controlled with lisinopril. No history of any surgeries  and there are no known allergies.  Chief Complains:  Mr. Johnson visited the clinic  complaining of severe  ongoing pain in his right foot and lower leg  especially at night. He also reported his foot has had slow healing sores and wounds that have not healed even after several weeks. He mentioned his foot often feels cold compared to the left one and the color appears to look paler. He revealed that despite quitting smoking  he still has a history of chronic smoking. He has also noticed an increasing difficulty in walking due to the pain which seems to escalate when he elevates his leg.   This case is designed to shed light on Critical Limb Ischemia  a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet and legs) and has started to cause severe pain and skin breakdown. This clinical scenario is an alert to medical students that early diagnosis and prompt treatment can prevent limb amputation and enhance the quality of patient's life. It also highlights the importance of counseling patients on lifestyle modifications to combat the underlying risk factors. Therefore  a comprehensive assessment following his highlighted symptoms is crucial.
7,10,85,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial85,Patient Information  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 65 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired fireman  Medical History  John has a 20-year history of untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. His other significant medical conditions include hypertension managed with medication  and a 30-pack year smoking history. He also has a history of sedentary lifestyle with poor compliance with dietary recommendations. He has no known allergies to medications.  Presenting Complaint  Mr. Doe presents with severe rest pain in his left foot  which is worse at night and relieved by hanging his foot off the side of the bed. The intense pain  primarily in the toes and heel  has been disturbing his sleep for the past week. On examination  the distal foot is cold to touch with weak pedal pulses. There are areas of skin discoloration on his toes and a small non-healing wound on the heel.  The severity of the rest pain  the physical examination findings indicative of lower perfusion  and the lifestyle  personal and medical history of Mr. Doe including longstanding untreated diabetes and smoking history are highly suggestive of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). He should undergo further diagnostic tests including Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)  toe-brachial index (TBI)  Doppler ultrasound  and possibly angiography to confirm the diagnosis and plan appropriate intervention. Multidisciplinary involvement including a vascular surgeon  diabetologist  and a dietitian will be critical for the comprehensive management of this patient.
7,10,86,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial86,Patient Case  Demographics:   A 65-year-old African American male  retired construction worker  non-smoker with a BMI of 28.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years  maintained on metformin. He also has hypertension well-controlled with lisinopril. In addition  the patient has dyslipidemia and is on atorvastatin for the same. He also has peripheral arterial disease (PAD)  for which he is on Aspirin and concluded angioplasty three years ago.  Key Complaints:  The patient presents to the clinic with complaints of persistent  worsening pain in his right foot  especially during the nights. He mentions that for the past few days  the pain has been so severe that even the weight of his bedding has been unbearable. He also reports a non-healing ulcer on the sole of his foot that started as a minor skin tear one month ago. Furthermore  the patient has found it increasingly difficult to walk even short distances due to severe pain. He has not noticed any change in the skin color of his foot or any persistent infections.  On physical examination  you find that his right foot is significantly cooler to touch as compared to the left one with an absent dorsalis pedis pulse. The patient has a full thickness ulcer of 2cm diameter on the plantar aspect of his right foot with irregular margins and yellowish slough at the base. Capillary refill time is more than 3 seconds distally.  The student should consider the given symptoms  signs  and patient history to reach the diagnosis and stratify the severity of critical limb ischemia. This would require knowledge about associated risk factors  symptoms of progression of PAD to critical limb ischemia  and strategic management plans. Awareness about the classification system to determine the severity would also be expected.
7,10,87,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial87,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information:   - Mr. Ramirez  62 years old  - Male - Hispanic ethnicity - Occupation: Retired firefighter - Marital Status: Married  has three children - Resides in Austin  Texas  Past medical history:  The patient has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with Metformin and a strict diet for 10 years. He also has a 15-year history of hypertension controlled with Lisinopril. 7 years ago  he was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD)  intermittent claudication managed conservatively. In addition  he has a 30 pack-year history of smoking but quit 5 years ago  shortly after being diagnosed with emphysema. There is also a family history of cardiovascular disease  with both his father and grandfather suffering from myocardial infarction under the age of 65.  Key Complaints:  Over the past few months  Mr. Ramirez has experienced an escalation of rest pain in his right foot. He recounts cramping pain exacerbated during sleep or when his leg is elevated. Initially  the pain was infrequent and manageable with over-the-counter pain relief  but it has since increased in frequency and intensity.   Mr. Ramirez also reports a non-healing wound on his right foot. He noticed it around six weeks ago  dismissing it initially as a minor injury. However  it has since not improved and has progressively worsened  showing signs of tissue necrosis.   He is now unable to walk without assistance due to his debilitating pain and impaired foot function. His symptoms are now causing him significant distress  interrupting his sleep  and gravely impacting his quality of life. He is also concerned about his foot's appearance and fears his foot may have to be amputated.  The above features suggest a case of critical limb ischemia  a severe form of peripheral artery disease. The alarm features include rest pain  tissue loss shown by the non-healing wound  and impaired function of his foot. This case would form the basis of medical students learning the presentation  potential complications  and management of critical limb ischemia.
7,10,88,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial88,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)  Patient's Demographics:  - Age: 67 years - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupancy: Retired Military Veteran - Marital Status: Divorced - No history of Alcohol or Tobacco use  Past Medical History:  - Ischemic heart disease diagnosed two years ago  treated with medication - Hypertension managed with medication for the past five years - Type II diabetes mellitus diagnosed eight years ago  controlled with oral hypoglycemics - Underwent lower right extremity bypass surgery three years ago due to peripheral artery disease (PAD)  Key Complaints:  - Suffers from persistent right leg pain  described as severe and burning especially at rest  worse at night - Non-healing ulcers on the right foot’s big toe  noticed around a month ago  - The pain intensifies when elevating the leg and alleviates somewhat with the foot in a dependent state  - On and off feeling of coldness in the right foot for several months - Reduced walking distance over the past year due to claudication  currently around 50 meters  When arriving at the hospital he was wheelchair-bound due to severe pain upon applying any pressure on his foot. The patient denies any fever  chills  or sudden weight loss. He complains of occasional dizziness and shortness of breath upon exertion.  This case can be used to educate medical students about recognizing and treating critical limb ischemia  which is a severe obstruction of the arteries that drastically reduces blood flow to the extremities and has the potential to lead to amputation if not treated urgently. It also intends to stress how significant comorbidities are in relation to CLI  and the need to manage these appropriately to delay its progression and prevent complications.
7,10,89,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial89,Case Report: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: Name: Mr. David Stevens  Age: 62 years Gender: Male Occupation: Retired military officer Marital status: Married Smoking Status: Ex-smoker Alcohol Use: Socially  Past Medical History:  Mr. Stevens has hypertension  which is well-controlled with medication (Lisinopril). He has a 10-year history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  managed by Metformin. He also has a past medical history of hypercholesteremia treated with Atorvastatin. He quit smoking ten years ago  but had a 20-pack year history prior to cessation.  Chief Complaints:  Mr. Stevens came to the clinic complaining of a progressive onset of rest pain in the right lower leg that has been worsening over the last two weeks. The pain often wakes him up at night and he has found temporary relief by hanging his leg over the side of the bed. However  the pain has become more frequent and is now persistent throughout the day.   Additionally  he reports that the skin on that leg has become noticeably paler  and he has developed a non-healing ulcer on his right big toe. He has also noticed that the foot has become cold to touch over the last few days.  Mr. Stevens has significant difficulty walking due to the pain and has started using a cane for support. He also reports feeling fatigued  which has been impacting his daily activities.  End Note: Although this patient's case is hypothetical  it is intended to depict a typical presentation of a patient with critical limb ischemia. The training case teaches students to identify key signs and symptoms  and how to connect these to the patient's past medical history  supporting the formulation of a potential diagnosis. In reality  the diagnosis would be confirmed with further diagnostic tests  such as doppler ultrasound  ankle-brachial index (ABI)  and angiography. 
7,10,90,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial90,Case Study: Critical Limb Ischemia  Patient Information: Patient: Mr. X Age: 65 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired engineer Habitual Influences: Smoker for past 40 years  occasional alcohol consumption  Past Medical History:  Mr. X has a significant past medical history including Type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed ten years prior but poorly managed  Hypertension  Hyperlipidemia  and a history of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) with stenting performed 5 years ago. His family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases.   Key Complaints:  Mr. X presented at the hospital with a chief complaint of persistent  severe pain in his right lower leg  specifically in the calf and foot region  for the past few weeks - even at rest. He also noted color change (paler skin) in his right foot  the appearance of non-healing  painful ulcers on his toes  and the sensation of cold in comparison to the other foot. He mentioned that he gets temporary relief with pain on hanging his leg in a dependent position. The pain has been affecting his sleep and he can barely walk due to the severity of pain and weakness.   Previous Treatments and Medications: Aspirin  statins  antihypertensives  and oral hypoglycemic agents   These symptoms and history suggest a condition of critical limb ischemia  indicating a severe obstruction in the arteries  reducing the blood flow to the extremities (hands  feet  or legs) leading to severe pain  skin ulcers or sores  or even gangrene. It's a complication of PAD and an immediate evaluation and intervention is necessary to avoid detrimental consequences like amputation.

7,10,97,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial97,Case Report:  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Dennis Sutton Age: 68 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Policeman  Medical History: Mr. Sutton is a former smoker with a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 12 years. He has peripheral artery disease that was diagnosed five years ago and has been on medication since the diagnosis. Additionally  he has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 8 years ago due to ischemic heart disease. His mother suffered a stroke at the age of 75.  Key Complaints: Mr. Sutton presents with progressive pain in his lower extremities that has been persistent for two months  especially in the right calf and foot. He reports that the pain intensifies when he walks and significantly decreases during rest  a condition referred to as intermittent claudication.   Additionally  he complains of numbness and coldness in his right foot along with a non-healing wound on the lateral aspect of the right foot which first appeared three weeks ago. On close observation  the foot appears dusky with notable absence of hair growth and brittle nails  indicative of poor circulation.   Mr. Sutton reports difficulty in sleeping due to the occurrence of pain at night  requiring him to hang his leg over the side of the bed for relief  thus indicating Rest Pain  a severe form of PAD. Over the last week  the symptoms have exacerbated  negatively impacting his daily activities and quality of life  raising suspicion for critical limb ischemia.  This case encourages the students to evaluate the severity of disease based on clinical presentation  assess the multi-factorial risk factors  consider the potential differential diagnoses  and recommend appropriate management and prevention strategies for critical limb ischemia.

7,10,99,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial99,Patient Information: Mr. T. Johnson  68-year-old African American male  retired construction worker.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a history of uncontrolled hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus  and a 30-pack-year smoking history but quit ten years ago. He has been non-compliant with his diabetic medication and diet regimen.  Key Complaints: The patient presents to the clinic with a three-month history of severe shooting pain in his left calf muscle that occurs after walking about ten blocks. The pain eases with rest. However  in the past week  Mr. Johnson has started experiencing pain at rest  especially at night  disturbing his sleep. He also reports experiencing mild left foot numbness. There are no associated complaints of chest pain  dyspnea  dizziness  or palpitations.  On examination  there is a 1 cm  deep ulcer on the dorsal surface of his left foot  with poor granulation tissue and a mild foul-smelling discharge. The skin on his left leg is cold to touch with shiny  thin skin  lack of leg hair  thickened toe nails  and his foot has a bluish discoloration. Pedal pulses are barely palpable on his left foot compared to his right.   The rest of the physical examination  including his cardiovascular and neurological examination  is normal.   This case scenario helps to highlight the classic clinical findings associated with critical limb ischemia (CLI)  an urgent  severe presentation of peripheral artery disease (PAD)  where prompt recognition and management can reduce the high risk of limb amputation and cardiovascular events.
7,10,100,diagnosis7-prompt10-trial100,Case Scenario:  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Johnson Age: 65 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Johnson has come in with severe pain in his right lower limb  especially while walking or climbing stairs. He reports that the pain is also present at rest and is worse at night. He mentions that the pain has been escalating over the past six months. He additionally states that he has noticed some non-healing wounds on his right foot.  Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He smoked cigarettes from his teenage years until a decade ago when he quit. He has also been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease about 3 years back and was treated conservatively.  Physical Examination: On examination  there is a non-healing ulcer on his right foot  and the right foot appears pale compared to the left. The foot is cool to touch  and the posterior tibial pulse and dorsalis pedis pulse are weak on the right side compared to the left.  Summary: The above presentation is a typical case of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The presence of severe pain  even at rest  along with the existence of non-healing ulcers strongly suggests the progression of peripheral artery disease to CLI. Combined with this patient's age  history of smoking  and other comorbidities like diabetes  hypertension  and documented peripheral artery disease  this scenario makes an excellent training case for medical students to learn about CLI  which could help them diagnose and manage such conditions effectively in their future practice.
