14,1,1,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial1,Title: Patient Presentation - Native-valve Infective Endocarditis  Demographics: Patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male. Occupation is a construction worker and he's a smoker with a 30-pack year history. Currently married  lives with his wife in their own home; they have two grown-up children.  Medical History: The patient has a known history of type II Diabetes Mellitus for the past 10 years  which is poorly controlled. The patient also has a history of Hypertension for the last 5 years. Both conditions were managed with prescribed medication.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a three-week history of intermittent fever  chills  night sweats and unintentional weight loss. He also reports fatigued feeling over the course of the last month. There is no history of shortness of breath  chest pain  hemoptysis  syncope  or seizures.  Examination: On physical examination  patient was found to be febrile with a temperature of 101°F. There were noticeable Janeway lesions on the palms of his hands. Cardiac auscultation revealed early diastolic murmur best heard at left sternal sector and apex.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Blood cultures were collected and sent for analysis. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a large vegetative mass attached to the bicuspid aortic valve suggestive of Infective Endocarditis.  The patient's symptoms  along with his physical exam findings and echocardiographic findings  make Infective Endocarditis the likely diagnosis.  Treatment and Management: The patient is immediately admitted to hospital given the serious nature of his condition  and intravenous antibiotics are initiated after drawing blood cultures. Surgical treatment options are also being considered based on his clinical condition and echocardiographic findings.  The patient's diabetic control will require optimization and management during his hospital stay. His smoking habits and hypertension control will also need addressing as part of general good health practices and to reduce future cardiovascular risk.
14,1,2,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial2,Title: A Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Good afternoon  colleagues. Today  I am presenting a case of native-valve infective endocarditis in a 58-year-old Caucasian male.  Our patient  Mr. Smith  is a heavy smoker and has been for the last 35 years. He has a significant past medical history including Type II Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension and Rheumatic Fever  which he suffered from in his early teens. He was recently hospitalized 3 months ago for an unrelated surgical procedure. He also has a history of poor dental hygiene which is notable for this condition.  Mr. Smith presented with a 4-week history of low-grade temperature with noticeable sweats especially during the night time. He also reports losing weight despite having a normal diet and increased ruits and low energy levels for the past month.  Physical examination revealed a diastolic murmur at the left sternal border which was hitherto unwitnessed. We also observed petechiae in his conjunctiva and Roth spots on ophthalmoscopic examination. A few Janeway lesions were detected on the palmar aspects of his hands.   Preliminary blood tests showed evidence of anemia with a high ESR  suggestive of an ongoing inflammatory process. His blood cultures are currently being evaluated. A transthoroscopic echo cardiogram was performed  demonstrating a bulky vegetative mass on his mitral valve  identifying the likely source of infection.  Our working diagnosis  based on clinical findings  past medical history  and initial investigations  is Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  most likely originating from oral bacteria secondary to his poor dental hygiene.  The patient remains hospitalized for further investigations  confirmatory diagnostic modalities and initiation of definitive treatment plan. A multidisciplinary approach  involving cardiology  infectious disease specialists and a cardiothoracic surgeon  has been undertaken for the management of this case.  Thank you.
14,1,3,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial3,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old Caucasian male presented to the hospital complaining of persistent fever  weakness  and unintentional weight loss over the past three weeks. He has also experienced night sweats  malaise  and occasional confusion. He has noticed a new heart murmur which was not previously noted.  Patient's Demographics Information: Name: Not Disclosed Age: 60 Sex: Male Identifies as: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Plumber Smoking History: 20 pack years (quit 10 years ago) Alcohol: reports moderate consumption Family history: Father had ischemic heart disease. Mother had type 2 diabetes.  Past Medical History: - Diagnosed with rheumatic fever at age 10. - Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation and stenosis noted in the past two years. - Recurrent urinary tract infections in the past year. - No known drug allergies.  - Last vaccination was an influenza vaccine administered last fall. - Regular medications include Lisinopril and low-dose aspirin.   On physical examination  the patient has a low-grade fever of 98.9°F. A systolic murmur was heard on auscultation  and Osler's nodes and Janeway lesions were noted on the palms and soles  classic signs of IE disease.  Upon discussing the patient's health history and results of the physical examination  the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) was considered. The patient is admitted for further diagnostic workup and treatment  including blood cultures  an echocardiogram to confirm the suspected diagnosis  and empirical antibiotic treatment.   Given the patient's past medical history of aortic regurgitation and recurrent urinary tract infections  as well as his occupational history  the endocarditis might be due to streptococcal or staphylococcal organisms. The diagnosis and treatment plan will depend on the results of blood culture and sensitivity  which will guide the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy.   In summary  this patient presents classic symptoms of infective endocarditis that requires immediate medical attention in order to prevent any potential complications  such as heart failure or embolisms.
14,1,4,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial4,Patient Presentation:   Our patient is Mr. Alan Henry  a 64-year-old Caucasian male who has presented with symptoms concerning for native valve infective endocarditis (IE).   Mr. Henry lives in a suburban neighborhood in Houston  Texas and is a retired mechanical engineer. He has been a non-smoker for 12 years but has a 20-year history of smoking. He does not consume alcohol or engage in any illicit drug use. He follows a regular diet and maintains a moderate level of physical activity.   In terms of medical history  he has been diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus for the past 8 years  for which he is on oral hypoglycemic agents. He has been compliant with his medication and his diabetes has been relatively well-controlled. No known history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. He underwent a colonoscopy 5 years back which came back clear with no signs of any polyps or malignancies.   However  over the past several weeks  he has been experiencing intermittent fevers  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss. Recently  he has experienced several bouts of night sweats. These symptoms were initially thought to be an upper respiratory infection or flu and were treated accordingly. But the persistence of the symptoms has led to further investigation. On detailed questioning  he also mentioned experiencing occasional shortness of breath and mild chest discomfort over the past week.  His grandmother suffered from Rheumatic heart disease and his father passed away from a heart attack  so there is a family history of heart conditions. No known allergies to any medications or substances.   Given his symptoms  especially in the context of his diabetic status which puts him at increased risk  along with his family history  we suspect a diagnosis of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis. The patient is currently in stable condition but requires further diagnostic tests  including blood cultures and an echocardiogram  to confirm the diagnosis and determine the most appropriate therapeutic approach.
14,1,5,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial5,Title: Infective Endocarditis in A Native Valve: A Case Study  Introduction:  We present a case of a 64-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. X  with infective endocarditis on native valves. Mr. X  a retired teacher  lives with his wife in Charlotte  North Carolina. He was referred to our hospital by his primary care physician after investigations indicated potential endocarditis.   Prior Medical History:  Prior to this  Mr. X enjoyed relatively good health. He has a history of non-insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past eight years  which has been managed with metformin. In addition  he has mild hypertension  controlled through lifestyle changes and medication. There is no recorded case of drug allergies in his medical history.  Recent History:  In the weeks nursing up to his current presentation  Mr. X complained of recurrent mild fevers and fatigue. His family recounted that he had an unexplained weight loss over the same period. He also reported an episode of nocturnal diaphoresis noticeable for the past few weeks. Mr. X recalls having treated a dental abscess at a local dental clinic around a month ago but denies intravenous drug use or other possible portals of entry for infection.  Current Presentation:  On physical examination  Mr. X exhibited Osler nodes on his fingertips and Janeway lesions on the palms and soles. Both are classical vascular phenomena  typically seen in endocarditis. On auscultation  an early diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal edge was perceived suggestive of aortic regurgitation. Ophthalmoscope examination showed Roth spots.  Investigations:  The preliminary bloodwork indicated increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)  suggesting an ongoing inflammatory process. Three sets of blood cultures have been drawn at different times and have been sent to the laboratory for analysis. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) report showed vegetations on the aortic valve  confirming our suspected diagnosis of infective endocarditis on native valves.  Discussion:  This case illustrates the importance of recognizing various clinical manifestations of infective endocarditis for earlier diagnosis  especially in patients with known risk factors for disease  like diabetes. Though not a typical high-risk patient for endocarditis without any evident cardiac structural deformities or previous history of cardiac valve diseases  the dental procedure potentially served as a point of entry for the causative bacteria.   Conclusion:  Infective endocarditis in native valves is a serious medical condition that requires timely detection and aggressive medical management. The valuable lessons from our patient  Mr. X  underline the grave implications of a seemingly mild dental infection in an otherwise healthy individual. Consequently  it underscores the utility of prophylactic antibiotics in high-risk patients before procedures that may lead to bacteremia.
14,1,6,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial6,Title: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Presentation  Patient Profile:  The patient is a 70-year-old male Caucasian with a history of intravenous drug use. He is known to the medical community and has been regularly attending for the past 40 years. He is a retired manual labor worker and currently resides in Brooklyn  New York. Because of his addiction  he lives alone and is occasionally taken care of by a social services group. However  his frequent and consistent substance abuse has estranged him from family and friends. He doesn't have a regular eating habit and also suffers from malnutrition.   Medical History:  The patient's prior medical history includes Hepatitis C  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  and recurrent infective endocarditis  all likely associated with his IV drug use. His surgical history is benign  although he was hospitalized multiple times due to infections related to IV drug use. Immune suppression due to substance abuse and unhealthy lifestyle makes him vulnerable to recurrent infections.   Presenting Complaint:  Upon presentation  the patient complains of a one-week history of worsening productive cough  subjective fevers  night sweats  malaise  and unintentional weight loss. He also reported increasing difficulty in breathing and occasional palpitations. The patient had pallor and appeared chronically ill with poor dentition. He had a temperature of 38.5°C (101.2°F)  a heart rate of 100 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute.  Upon examination  he exhibited signs consistent with infective endocarditis  which include Osler's nodes (painful red or purple pea-sized skin nodules)  Janeway lesions (painless flat skin spots)  and splinter hemorrhages in the nail beds. Additionally  he had an audible heart murmur.   Diagnosis:  The patient has a high clinical suspicion for native-valve infective endocarditis based on his clinical signs  symptoms  past medical history  and lifestyle. Further diagnostic work-up including blood cultures and an echocardiogram would be invaluable to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.  Conclusion:  Addressing this patient's medical needs will require a holistic and multidisciplinary approach. It is critical to treat his endocarditis  but equally important to address his ongoing substance abuse and ensure he is offered support and resources to help him with addiction. Regular follow-up  providing dietary and lifestyle counselling  and promoting engagement with community resources are key components of this approach.
14,1,7,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial7,Subject: Presentation of Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile Name: Patient X Age: 62 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Postal Worker  Presenting Issue: The patient presents with persistent fever  fatigue  night sweats  and a new-onset heart murmur. He also mentioned unexplained weight loss over the past few weeks. All these symptoms suggest the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Medical History: Patient X has a significant cardiovascular history. He was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 10 years ago  which is controlled with medication (amlodipine and atorvastatin). He had an episode of rheumatic fever in his early 20s  which did not have cardiac involvement at that time. He has no known allergies. Patient X has been a smoker for about 40 years  with a 20-pack year history. He quit drinking alcohol about 8 years ago. There is no history of IV drug use.  Family History: Patient's father passed away in his early 70s due to a myocardial infarction. His mother  currently in her late 80s  has chronic arthritis and hypertension. His older sister has type-II diabetes and hypertension.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  the patient appears chronically ill. He is afebrile  with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  pulse rate of 90 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Cardiac examination reveals a new grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border. There is no observable Janeway lesions or Osler's nodes. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.  Investigations and Management: Three sets of blood cultures have been sent to the lab. Echo-cardiography is scheduled to confirm the diagnosis and help decide on the management plan. Empirical antibiotic therapy will be initiated once blood cultures have been collected.  In the presence of a new systolic murmur and persistent fever  native valve infective endocarditis is the leading differential diagnosis for this patient. He is likely to be hospitalized for ongoing medical management until his condition stabilizes and improves.  Thank you for your attention. 
14,1,8,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial8,Patient Presentation: We present a case of a 65-year-old African American male  Mr. X  who comes in presenting signs and symptoms suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis. He is a retired Postal Service worker  a nonsmoker  and moderate alcohol consumer. He lives with his wife in the suburban area and is relatively physically active with no known adverse environmental exposures.  Medical History: Mr. X has a notable past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he has been on oral hypoglycemic medications for the past 10 years. Additionally  there is a history of hypertension  controlled with amlodipine and ramipril. He also has a documented history of rheumatic fever from early childhood.   He has no surgical history but underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure 5 years ago following a suspected myocardial infarction  which was later ruled out. There is no known drug allergy history  and the family’s genetic history reveals no predispositions to cardiac malformations or autoimmune diseases.   Five days prior to his presentation  he had been seen at a local Emergency Room for what had been assumed to be flu-like episode and was discharged home with symptomatic therapy.  Currently  in addition to his chronic anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic medications  he is on daily low-dose aspirin as prophylaxis for cardiovascular diseases  as per his past Rheumatologist’s suggestions.  Presentation: Today  he presents with a one-week history of persistent high-grade fever  malaise  and exertional dyspnea  accompanied by a new onset of a diastolic murmur on auscultation  prompting considerations for complicated infective rheumatic fever sequelae - Infective Endocarditis. 
14,1,9,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial9,Patient Presentation  I would like to introduce Mr. Sutton  a 65-year-old Caucasian man with a significant history of intravenous drug use. He is currently employed as a construction worker and is a lifetime non-smoker. He lives with his wife and has six children. Mr. Sutton is a socially active individual with occasional alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History  Mr. Sutton has a notable history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection five years ago  which was successfully treated with appropriate antibiotics. He also has a history of mild hypertension  controlled with diet and exercise  and type 2 diabetes  managed with Metformin. Despite this  Mr. Sutton's injection drug use is of major concern as he has had episodes of relapse in the past years.   Recent Hospital Admission  Approximately one month ago  Mr. Sutton was admitted to the hospital for a short period due to a non-specific febrile illness with symptoms of malaise  weight loss  night sweats  and loss of appetite. His fever resolved with symptomatic treatment and he was discharged with advice for follow-up.  Current Presentation  Recently  Mr. Sutton has presented with a new onset of concerning symptoms including continuous fever  chills  and shortness of breath. He has also reported progressive weakness and occasional chest discomfort over the last two weeks. Physical examination revealed the presence of a new heart murmur and splinter hemorrhages in the nail beds  raising the suspicion of infective endocarditis.  Imaging and Laboratory Tests  Blood cultures were taken  which subsequently grew Staphylococcus aureus. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed vegetation on the tricuspid valve suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis. Further investigations are being conducted to assess the full extent of the infection.  Summary and Recommendation  Mr. Sutton's past medical history  combined with his continued intravenous drug use and the new onset of systemic and cardiovascular signs and symptoms  strongly indicates a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. I recommend urgent consultation with a Cardiologist and Infectious Disease specialist for further management and will be starting him on empiric antibiotic therapy in the meanwhile.
14,1,10,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial10,Title: Presentation of Patient Presenting with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Good Afternoon    Our patient today is Mrs. Jane Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian female who presents with symptoms suggesting of native-valve infective endocarditis. Mrs. Doe is a retired school teacher and lives with her husband in downtown Seattle.   Regarding her medical history  she is known to have a history of rheumatic heart disease  which she was diagnosed with in her mid-thirties. For this  she underwent surgical repair of the mitral valve about ten years ago and has been on long-term antibiotics ever since. Apart from this  she also has a history of hypertension for the past five years  which is well-controlled with medication. She is a non-smoker. She also denies any alcohol and drug use.  Mrs. Doe has arrived at our hospital today following a consultation at a dental clinic  where she underwent a teeth-cleaning procedure a week ago. She reports of having developed a high fever  general malaise  joint pain  and a new heart murmur that were not present in her previous medical examinations. Furthermore  she also has petechial lesions on her skin and mucous membranes.  Given her recent dental procedure  it is reasoned to suspect that it might have resulted in a bacteremia and consequent seeding of the previously damaged heart valve leading to infective endocarditis.   On examination  her temperature is elevated and cardiovascular examination reveals a systolic murmur. Blood tests show raised inflammatory markers. An echocardiogram has been ordered.  The combined clinical  pathological  and imaging findings at this stage strongly suggest a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Our next step would be to ascertain this possible diagnosis through further investigations and plan out an appropriate treatment and management strategy.  In conclusion  Mrs. Doe's past medical history of rheumatic heart disease and recent invasive dental procedure put her at an increased risk for developing infective endocarditis. Her case thus underscores the requirement for meticulous oral health maintenance in individuals with predisposing heart conditions.  Thank you for your attention.
14,1,11,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial11,Presentation:  Good morning/afternoon everyone   Today I'll be presenting the case of Mr. John Doe  a 60-year-old Caucasian male who has presented to our hospital with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Mr. Doe is an engineer by profession and has a history of smoking for the past 20 years. He is otherwise quite fit and active for his age and has no known history of illicit drug use. His current living situation is with his wife in a suburban house  and they have taken a domestic trip within the U.S about 2 weeks ago.  His past medical history includes a grade 3 mitral valve prolapse diagnosed about 7 years ago. He has been on appropriate medical management for the same. He also had an episode of pneumonia around 5 years ago  for which he was hospitalized and treated successfully. Mr. Doe was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 2 years ago  and he has been managing it with oral anti-diabetic agents since. He is not known to have any allergies.  Most recently (1 week prior)  he has been complaining of an intermittent high-grade fever  malaise  night sweats  and an unintentional weight loss. Additionally  his wife observed his nails turning pale and reported a few episodes of nosebleeds over the past week. It was these symptoms which prompted them to visit our hospital.  On examination  we noted a low-grade fever  pallor  and a new systolic murmur in the mitral area. There were also splinter hemorrhages near his nail beds and a positive Janeway's lesion on his right foot. We are currently awaiting the results of blood cultures and sensitivity tests to confirm the diagnosis of infective endocarditis and guide antibiotic therapy.  Given Mr. Doe's history of mitral valve prolapse  this could possibly be a case of native-valve endocarditis. His history of smoking and uncontrolled diabetes might have predisposed him to this condition. The patient's condition is being closely monitored and depending on the culture results  we may initiate aggressive antibiotic therapy or consider the need for surgical intervention.  This is a brief overview of our patient's case. Thank you for your time and I am open to any further discussion or suggestions.
14,1,12,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial12,Title: Presentation of a Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male – Mr. Smith.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Smith presented with complaints of recurrent fevers  fatigue  and discomfort in his chest area over the past few weeks. He also mentioned unintended weight loss  loss of appetite  and night sweats.  History:  Mr. Smith has a known history of heart disease  specifically aortic valve stenosis  diagnosed six years ago. Apart from this  he is hypertensive and his blood pressure is usually well-controlled with medication. He was treated for pneumonia 5 years ago. He is a non-smoker and maintains a light to moderate alcohol habit. There is no reported history of intravenous drug misuse.  Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. Smith appeared fatigued  with feverishness being noted. His vital signs were generally stable; however  moderate hypertension was noted. Cardiac auscultation revealed a murmur consistent with aortic regurgitation  a new finding compared to his previous examinations.   Further Investigations: Blood work was ordered which revealed a raised ESR and C-reactive protein suggesting a systemic inflammation. His complete blood count indicated mild anemia and leukocytosis. Three sets of blood cultures were ordered given his presentation  fever  and new murmur.   Echo Findings: A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed which indicated the presence of vegetations on the aortic valve  providing further evidence towards a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   In conclusion  given the patient's clinical presentation  symptoms  medical history  laboratory findings  and the results of the echocardiogram  we suspect him to be suffering from infective endocarditis affecting his native aortic valve. He will need to be started on an appropriate course of antibiotics  and the blood culture results will guide any changes to the antibiotic regimen. Cardiology has been consulted for potential valve replacement given the severity of his valve disease. Further  patient education is critical to ensure good oral hygiene and avoidance of any activities that may lead to bacteremia.
14,1,13,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial13,Title: Presentation of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis in a 65-year-old Male  Patient Profile: Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a BMI of 27  who has been living in the urban population of Utah. He is married and enjoys spending time walking his dog in nearby parks. He used to work as an engineer and is now enjoying his retirement.  Medical History: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he has been under oral hypoglycemic drug therapy for the past 8 years. He also has a known cardiovascular disease history  having suffered a myocardial infarction 3 years ago. This was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention  stent placement  and aspirin plus clopidogrel daily. He has hypertension which has been well controlled with an angiotensin II receptor blocker. He had a completed course of immunizations and denies any allergies. He doesn't smoke  but has a history of moderate alcohol consumption.  Presenting Signs & Symptoms: The patient presented at the hospital with a 3-week history of low-grade fever  chills  and a loss of appetite. Other symptoms included night sweats  weight loss  and malaise. The patient also reported recently noticing spots on his skin - petechiae  as well as painful  inflamed fingertips (Osler's nodes).  Diagnostic Imaging and Lab Findings: On examination  the patient was found to have a heart murmur suggestive of dysfunctional heart valves. A transesophageal echocardiogram revealed signs of valvular vegetations and regurgitation  indicative of native-valve infective endocarditis. He had a high white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was also elevated. Blood cultures revealed the growth of Streptococcus viridans.   This patient is diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis and would need aggressive treatment with antibiotics. He might also need surgical intervention if his condition doesn't improve with medical treatment. His diabetes mellitus and past history of cardiac diseases make him more susceptible to complications  hence requiring stringent monitoring and follow-up.
14,1,14,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial14,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in Post-Menopausal Woman  Introduction: The following presentation focuses on a 65-year-old female patient  initially presenting with fluctuating fever and signs of heart failure  later diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.   Patient's Demographics:  Name : Mrs. Jane Doe Age: 65 years Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Profession: Retired teacher Marital Status: Married Residential Address: Newark  New Jersey  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both managed with medication for over 10 years. She was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus five years ago  and it has been reasonably well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. She went through menopause at the age of 51 and has been undergoing hormone replacement therapy. Her immunization records are up-to-date  including the flu and pneumococcal vaccines. She has never smoked and consumes alcohol occasionally.   Initial Presentation: The patient initially presented to the emergency department with a three-week history of fluctuating fever  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss. Over the past week  she had also developed increasing shortness of breath  distended neck veins  and swelling of her lower extremities  all of which were suggestive of right-sided heart failure.   Diagnosis: Given her clinical presentation and the presence of new heart murmurs on a physical exam  she was suspected of having infective endocarditis. This diagnosis was later confirmed by transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) which revealed large vegetations on her native mitral valve  and three separate blood cultures  all positive for Streptococcus viridans.   Conclusion: Our patient  a 65-year-old retired teacher with a history of controlled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type II diabetes mellitus  presented with symptoms related to infection and heart failure. Based on her clinical presentation  imaging results  and blood culture  she was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans  a common etiologic agent in such cases. Her subsequent treatment would include prolonged intravenous antibiotics and careful monitoring for potential complications  with consideration for surgical intervention if her condition deteriorates.
14,1,15,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial15,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Native-valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. A  who works as a postal clerk in a small town in Ohio. He has lived there for most of his life with his wife. They have two grown children who currently live out of state.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. A presents with a two-week history of general feelings of malaise  intermittent fever  night sweats  and recent unplanned weight loss. He has noticed progressive shortness of breath over the past week. He reports no chest pain  cough  nausea or vomiting. The patient appeared diaphoretic and fatigued at the time of presentation.  Past Medical History: Mr. A's past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus  both of which have been well-controlled with prescribed medications (Lisinopril 20 mg daily  Metformin 1000 mg twice daily). He also has a history of gout  which was managed with Allopurinol.   Rheumatic heart disease  a risk factor for infective endocarditis  is not present in his history. Mr. A has never had any dental procedures done recently. He does not smoke  drinks alcohol occasionally  and denies recreational drug use. He has no known allergies and is up to date with immunizations.   Family History: His father died of a stroke at age 72  and his mother has Alzheimer's disease. His younger sister has rheumatoid arthritis  and his older brother has coronary artery disease.  Discussion: Given Mr. A’s symptoms of general malaise  fever  night sweats  weight loss  and shortness of breath  together with his known prevalence of hypertension and diabetes  an initial diagnosis of infective endocarditis is considered. The definitive diagnosis would require further diagnostic tests such as blood cultures and echocardiography. If confirmed  prompt treatment with specific antibiotics and potentially surgery will be critical due to the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. Adequate control and monitoring of his diabetes and hypertension will also be essential in his overall management plan.
14,1,16,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial16,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis: Case Presentation  Patient Information: The patient is Mr. Smith  a 67-year-old Caucasian male with a residence in the metropolitan area.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Smith presents to the ER with three weeks of progressive weakness  night sweats  loss of appetite  and unintended weight loss. He also reports experiencing chills  fatigue  and a low-grade fever that has persisted despite taking over-the-counter medications.  Past Medical History: In terms of his past medical history  Mr. Smith quit smoking 12 years ago  after having smoked for over 25 years. He is a chronic alcoholic  despite several attempts at abstaining. He underwent gallbladder surgery 15 years earlier with no post-operative complications. He has an established diagnosis of hypertension  which is well controlled with medication (Lisinopril). He does not have any known allergies.  Present Medical History: The patient reports no recent hospitalizations or invasive procedures. He has not had any teeth removed or dental procedures performed recently. He denies intravenous drug use or risky sexual behavior. The patient hasn't traveled recently and he doesn't own any pets. He mentions that his symptoms have progressively worsened over the past week  prompting his visit to the ER.  Physical Examination Findings: Upon physical examination  the patient looks ill and lethargic. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/80 mmHg  pulse 89 bpm  temperature 38.4°C  and respirations 16 per minute. No signs of cyanosis  jaundice  or lymphadenopathy. Cardiac exam reveals a new murmur  suggestive of valvular disease. His extremities show splinter hemorrhages under the nails.  Laboratory Results: Blood tests reveal anemia  raised ESR  and CRP. White Blood cell count is elevated with a left shift. Blood cultures are pending. His liver enzymes were elevated  correlating with his history of chronic alcoholism.  Conclusion: Based on the presence of significant constitutional symptoms  a new murmur  and preliminary lab results  our primary differential diagnosis is Native Valve Infective Endocarditis  most likely in the setting of chronic alcohol use and older age. We are waiting for the blood cultures to target the treatment accordingly. 
14,1,17,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial17,Patient Presentation  Title: A Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  a 58-year-old Caucasian male  presenting with native-valve infective endocarditis.

Family History: His mother died from Breast cancer  and his father had a stroke in his sixties. His sister has Type II diabetes  and his brother suffers from alcoholism.  Recent Health Status: Recently  Mr. Doe has been experiencing subjective fevers  fatigue  night sweats  weight loss  and a new-onset heart murmur which raised suspicion for endocarditis. He also noticed tiny red or purplish spots (Petechiae) on his skin.  Clinical Assessment: Patient's clinical presentation and investigation results - positive blood cultures and echocardiography showing valvular vegetations  confirmed the diagnosis of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis.  Plan: Mr. Doe has been admitted to the cardiology team for intravenous antibiotic therapy and close monitoring. Cardiac surgery consultation has been sought for possible valve replacement surgery. Mr. Doe will have to maintain good glycemic control  attend regular follow-ups  and follow a strict medication regimen to manage his concomitant conditions and prevent further complications. 
14,1,18,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial18,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 56-year-old African American male who presents to our clinic today reporting persistent fever  chills  fatigue  weakness  and unintentional weight loss over a period of 4-6 weeks. He confirms occasional shortness of breath along with light-headedness upon exertion. The patient also reports recent episodes of night sweats and a sense of generalized malaise. He has noticed the presence of a rash on his lower limbs and red spots on the skin of his palms and soles.   Past Medical History:   The patient’s past medical history is significant for poorly controlled Type II Diabetes  chronic kidney disease (Stage IIIa)  and hypertension. He is also a former IV drug user and has a history of hepatitis C infection. He quit smoking 9 years ago but continues to consume alcohol occasionally. Of note  the patient reports no prior heart conditions  nor a family history of congenital heart defects or any heart conditions.  In review of his past medical records  the patient has had recurrent urinary tract infections over the past year. He has been on a regimen of Metformin and Lisinopril for his diabetes and hypertension  respectively.   In summary  given the patient's symptoms chronology coupled with his past medical history  the patient is suspected to have native-valve infective endocarditis. Further diagnostic procedures including blood culture and echocardiogram are needed to confirm this suspicion.   In the management of his condition  both his current lifestyle and chronic medical conditions will have to be taken into consideration to provide optimal  individualized care.
14,1,19,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial19,Title: A Case Presentation of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male  named Mr. Smith  living in an urban neighborhood in New York City. He is a heavy smoker with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been an insulin-dependent diabetic for the past 15 years. He is also known to be hypertensive for which he has been on medication. There is no known family history of any major health disorders. Professionally  Mr. Smith is a retired mechanic and denies any alcohol or drug use.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Smith initially reported experiencing a low-grade fever that fluctuates around 100.4ºF (38ºC) for the past few weeks. Accompanying symptoms include malaise  fatigue  and an unintended weight loss of about 8lbs over the past month. Recently  he has also started experiencing shortness of breath and noticing blood in his phlegm. He denies having chest pain  headache  cough  wheezing  nausea  vomiting  loss of appetite  abdominal pain  diarrhea  or rash.  Clinical Examination: The physical examination revealed a systolic murmur best heard in the left third intercostal space and tenderness on the balls of his feet. The patient also presented with splinter hemorrhage under his nails  which is suggestive of endocarditis. No other significant findings were identified.  Summary: In summary  Mr. Smith is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant of type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and smoking-induced COPD who now presents with typical features of infective endocarditis. The prolonged low-grade fever  weight loss  shortness of breath  and the physical findings of a heart murmur and splinter hemorrhages indicate a possible diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Further investigations  including blood cultures  echocardiogram  and additional necessary diagnostic tests  are planned to confirm the diagnosis and formulate an appropriate treatment plan. 
14,1,20,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial20,[Slide 1] Introduction  Today  we will present a patient diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis  an edge-case that results from a bacterial  fungal  or viral infection that impacts patients with no history of heart disease with normally functioning heart valves.  [Slide 2] Patient's Demographic Information  Our patient  Mr. John Smith  is a 55-year-old Caucasian male from Melbourne  Australia. He has been married for 30 years and has no children. He is a retired banker who has remained largely sedentary since retirement.  [Slide 3] Relevant Medical History  Mr. Smith has a history of mild obesity and type 2 diabetes which were well-controlled till his most recent visit. He also self-reports being a casual smoker and drinks alcohol on social occasions. His earlier visits to the clinic have been characterized by Good glycemic control  measured at an HbA1c of 6.5%. However  he has never had any history of cardiovascular disease  valvular disorder  or rheumatic fever in his past.  [Slide 4] Presenting Symptoms   Mr. Smith presented with a fever of 38 degrees Celsius  ongoing for 2 weeks prior to this visit. He reported feeling generally unwell  with intermittent episodes of night sweats  malaise  and a recent unintentional weight loss of 5kg. On further assessment  we also found splenomegaly and symptoms pointing to mitral valve dysfunction  including a new systolic murmur.  [Slide 5] Investigation and Diagnosis   Blood work showed raised inflammatory markers and three positive sets of blood cultures growing streptococci viridans. An echocardiogram confirmed our suspicions of infective endocarditis showing vegetations on his previously normal functioning mitral valve.   [Slide 6] Conclusion   Mr. Smith’s unremarkable past medical history contrasted with his current diagnosis  reflects the need for a high index of suspicion when dealing with systemic symptoms paired with any evidence of valvular dysfunction  even in those without any prior history. The management plan is continuous observation  IV antibacterial therapy  and education about the gravity of not maintaining optimal glycemic control.
14,1,21,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial21,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe is a 70-year-old Caucasian male resident of New York City who presents to the clinic today with complaints of fever  fatigue  weight loss  and irregular heartbeats. His symptoms started approximately 7-10 days ago; his fevers have been intermittent but as high as 102 degrees Fahrenheit. He reports having lost approximately 12 pounds unintentionally over the past month.   Mr. Doe has a past medical history that is significant for congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation  for which he has been receiving treatment over the past 10 years. His other significant history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both well controlled with medication. He has no known allergies.   Mr. Doe's social history informs that he is a retired school teacher  living with his wife and does not smoke or consume alcohol. He reports a lack of physical activity due to progressive shortness of breath on exertion over the past year.  Upon examination  he appears ill and fatigued. Cardiac examination reveals a new murmur and irregular heart rate. Mild lower extremity edema is present.   With the current clinical presentation and past medical history  we suspect a potential diagnosis of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis. Further evaluations  including blood culture tests and echocardiography  will be planned to establish a definitive diagnosis and guide treatment options. His risk factors include his age  existing heart diseases  and diabetes mellitus.  It is crucial that Mr. Doe receive thorough  comprehensive care  which would require collaboration between cardiology  infectious disease specialists  and possibly cardiothoracic surgery should surgical management become necessary. The immediate focus would be on initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy while awaiting culture results and ensuring his hemodynamic stability.

His wife also noticed that his skin had developed a slight yellowish tint  and that he looked pale.   Examination: On examination  his heart rate was 90 bpm and his blood pressure was 140/90mmHg. Examination also revealed a new cardiac murmur on auscultation. Further observations included pallor  small pinpoint red spots on skin (petechiae)  and slightly yellow tint of the skin and sclera (suggestive of mild jaundice).   Conclusion: With his ongoing symptoms and new cardiac murmur  the initial clinical suspicion is towards infective endocarditis  specifically native-valve infective endocarditis  considering his increased age  male gender  and chronic medical condition like hypertension. He has been admitted for further investigation and management. Lab investigations including complete blood count  renal function test  liver function test and blood culture have been ordered. An echocardiogram will also be done to get a visual of his heart valves and chambers.  Disclaimer: This is a suspect case based on presenting symptoms and clinical observations. The final diagnosing will depend upon laboratory investigations and imaging studies.
14,1,24,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial24,Title: Case Presentation: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis   Demographics: Patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male from a rural community. He is retired and lives with his wife.  Presenting Complaints and Symptoms: The patient has presented to the ER with a two-week history of persistent fever  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss of 15 pounds. He also mentions experiencing night sweats in the past week.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of rheumatic heart disease from childhood and underwent repair of aortic valve 20 years ago. He also has controlled hypertension for the past 10 years. He is negative for any history of intravenous drug use or any immunocompromising conditions and his family history is non-contributory.  Clinical Findings: The patient has an elevated heart rate and a systolic heart murmur on cardiac examination. Skin examination showed Osler nodes on the pads of his fingers and Janeway lesions on the palms and soles. His blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg and he's having moderate shortness of breath.  Investigation Findings: His blood cultures have tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus. His echocardiography shows vegetations on native aortic valve with no evidence of abscess formation.  Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history  symptoms  physical findings  and lab results  he has been diagnosed with Native-valve Infective Endocarditis.   Treatment Plan: The patient will be hospitalized for treatment. He will be started on a combination of intravenous antibiotics according to sensitivity reports. The option of surgical intervention will be re-evaluated after an initial period of antibiotic therapy. Prognosis and recovery will be dependent on response to treatment and secondary complications.
14,1,25,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial25,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Thomas Mitchell is a 62-year-old Caucasian male who presents with flu-like symptoms  including fever  chills  weakness  and significant weight loss over the past 3 weeks. He also reports occasional shortness of breath and has noticed small  red or purple spots on his skin.  Demographic Information:  Mr. Mitchell is a retired office worker  lives with his wife  and has a history of occasional tobacco use. His alcohol consumption is within normal limits  and he has a history of recreational drug use  but declares sobriety for the last 10 years. He lives in a suburban area  exercises regularly  and manages to maintain a balanced diet.  Past Medical History: Mr. Mitchell has a history of mild hypertension  for which he takes Lisinopril. He also had dental work done approximately a month ago. His other past medical history includes intermittent asthma for which he uses a Ventolin inhaler. He has no history of heart diseases  diabetes  or other significant illnesses. He also has no known allergies. He underwent an appendectomy 25 years ago and reports no complications from the surgery. His vaccinations are up-to-date  including flu and pneumococcal vaccines.  The presentation and the timing of the dental work  along with the fact that he did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis at that time  points towards the likelihood of native valvular infective endocarditis induced by bacteremia from the dental procedure. Further investigations including blood cultures and echocardiography are warranted for conclusive diagnosis.
14,1,26,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial26,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Presentation:   Mr. John Warner  a 58-year-old Caucasian male presents with a 2-week history of generalized fatigue  intermittent fever  night sweats  weight loss  shortness of breath and a new-onset heart murmur. He is a non-smoker and reports occasional alcohol consumption. His occupation is a dental hygienist.  Past medical history: Mr. Warner has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus managed by oral hypoglycemic agents for 10 years. His glycemic control is generally optimal with the last HbA1c reading 7.0% three months ago. He is also hypertensive and on amlodipine 5mg daily. There is no family history of cardiovascular disease or any other genetic disorders.  Physical examination reveals pallor  osler nodes (painful  red  raised lesions on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet)  and Janeway lesions (non-tender flat lesions on the palms and soles). A new onset grade 3 systolic murmur is also appreciated at the left sternal border radiating to the axilla. These signs and symptoms along with patient’s medical and occupational histories raise the suspicion for infective endocarditis.   Further investigations  especially blood cultures  echocardiographic assessment for possible valvular expression  are required to confirm this. Early empirical antibiotic treatment is advised alongside strict blood sugar and blood pressure control given the patient's comorbidities.  Mr. Warner’s occupation in dental healthcare is significant  as oral bacteria may have gained access to the bloodstream during routine procedures  subsequently infecting the heart valve. Healthcare-associated infective endocarditis is of particular concern in this patient considering his occupational exposure.   In summation  Mr. Warner’s symptoms point towards a diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Further diagnostic investigation is required. An interdisciplinary approach involving a cardiologist  infectious disease specialist  and a diabetes and hypertension specialist is beneficial for comprehensive patient management and care.
14,1,27,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial27,Slide 1: Introduction  We present the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male presenting with symptoms indicative of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Slide 2: Demographics   Our patient  Mr. Smith  is a retired engineer  a lifetime non-smoker  and rarely consumes alcohol. He resides in the rural Midwest with his wife and has limited exposure to infectious agents. He does not have a history of intravenous drug use  no known allergies  and reports no recent travel outside of the country.  Slide 3: Symptoms   Mr. Smith has been experiencing recurrent fever and chills  fatigue  weakness  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss for the last four weeks. He has also been complaining of a persistent cough  dyspnea  and dark-colored urine.   Slide 4: Past Medical History   Before this presentation  Mr. Smith had been relatively healthy with a moderate  well-controlled hypertensive condition for which he takes an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. He also had a appendectomy at the age of 20  but otherwise has an unremarkable surgical history. There is no reported family history of heart disease  cancer  or diabetes.  Slide 5: Recent Medical Events  Approximately six weeks ago  Mr. Smith underwent a dental procedure involving extensive periodontal work. Following the procedure  he received a short course of oral antibiotics as a preventive measure. However  he experienced minor adverse gastrointestinal effects  which led to premature discontinuation of the antibiotics.  Slide 6: Hypothesis  Given the recent dental surgery  ongoing symptoms  and the presence of a predisposing factor - hypertension  native-valve infective endocarditis is a strong diagnostic consideration for Mr. Smith.  Slide 7: Next Steps   We recommend ordering blood cultures to identify potential bacterial or fungal pathogens  as well as an echocardiogram to evaluate possible valvular damage and monitor disease progression. Long-term antibiotic therapy will likely be initiated  while considering Mr. Smith's history of an adverse reaction to antibiotics. We should also educate Mr. Smith on the importance of completing prescribed antibiotic courses to prevent recurrence of endocarditis or antibiotic resistance in future.
14,1,28,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial28,Subject: Clinical Presentation for Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Information: Patient Name: Mr. X Gender: Male Age: 64 years Race: Caucasian.   Presenting Concern: Mr. X presents with a two-week history of persistent fever  generalized malaise  and unintended weight loss. His temperature readings have consistently been above 38.5°C. These symptoms were associated with shortness of breath and palpitations.  Medical History: Mr. X has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  maintained on metformin  and a myocardial infarction 5 years ago. Mr. X underwent coronary artery bypass grafting following his myocardial infarction. He was a smoker but quit following his cardiac event. He consumes alcohol socially.   Family History: There is a strong family history of heart disease  with his father having passed away from congestive heart failure and a brother who has undergone angioplasty.   Current Medication:  Metformin 500 mg BD for diabetes and aspirin 75 mg OD as prophylaxis following coronary artery bypass grafting.  Physical Examination:  On cardiovascular examination  a new systolic murmur was appreciated at the apex  best heard in the mitral area. Lower-extremity pitting edema was seen bilaterally. Osler's nodes were present on examination of the hands  and other skin manifestations  such as Janeway lesions  were not seen.  Putting the clinical picture together  with a history of cardiac disease  persistence of fever  and new cardiac murmur  an initial impression of infective endocarditis is made. Additional investigations including blood cultures and echocardiography have been requested to confirm diagnosis.  This summarizes the clinical presentation of Mr. X who could potentially be dealing with native-valve infective endocarditis. Further investigations and management will be guided accordingly in collaboration with cardiology and infectious disease specialists.
14,1,29,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial29,Title: Presentation of a Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Patient  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. John Davis  Age: 72 years  Sex: Male Occupation: Retired engineer  Medical History: The patient in question  Mr. John Davis  is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  with a medical history significant for type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He has been managing both conditions for over 20 years with prescribed medications. He is a former smoker; he quit 10 years ago but had a 30-year smoking history prior to quitting. He denies any illicit drug usage. He has no known drug allergies.  Clinical Presentation: Mr. Davis has presented with a fever and fatigue persistent for two weeks  accompanied by poor appetite and unexpected weight loss. Mr. Davis also reported discomfort in his chest and shortness of breath which has been progressively worsening in the last week. These symptoms raised the suspicion of cardiac issues  which was further confirmed by the presence of a new-onset heart murmur noted during the physical examination.  Diagnostic Evaluation: On systematic examination  splenomegaly was noted. Initial lab investigations showed elevated white blood cell count and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). The subsequent blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus.   Standard transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed due to the heart murmur and revealed the presence of vegetation on the native aortic valve with a moderate regurgitation consistent with a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE).  Management & Conclusion: Following diagnosis  Mr. Davis was admitted to the hospital immediately and started on targeted intravenous antibiotic therapy guided by the antibiotic susceptibility testing from the blood cultures results. He has been referred to a cardiothoracic surgery team for further evaluation and management  considering his further risk of complications due to his age  diabetes  and hypertension.   Mr. Davis's case underscores the complexity and necessity for early diagnosis and intervention in native-valve infective endocarditis  particularly in patients with underlying chronic diseases. His management will require a multidisciplinary approach including cardiology  infectious diseases  and possibly cardiothoracic surgery.
14,1,30,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial30,Title: A Case Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male named John Smith. He resides in a suburban area and is a retired engineer. Prior to retirement  the patient was actively involved in construction projects. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially. He has been married for 30 years and has two adult children.  Medical history: The patient has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus approximately 10 years ago which he manages with oral medications. Additionally  he has a history of hypertension that has been managed with lifestyle adjustments and medication for the past 6 years.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith came to the hospital complaining of low-grade fever  fatigue  and mild shortness of breath that he has been experiencing for the past three weeks. He also mentioned intermittent night sweats during this period. He has lost weight recently – approximately 5kg over the past 2 months without dietary changes or increased physical activity. He reported experiencing a flu-like feeling around 4 weeks ago that resolved on its own.  Clinical Examination: On clinical examination  the patient looked ill and slightly pale. His pulse was 110 bpm and blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg. On auscultation  a new-onset murmur was noted on the mitral area. On fundoscopy  Roth spots were observed.  Diagnosis and Lab Findings: Based on the presenting symptoms  an initial diagnosis of possible infective endocarditis was made. To confirm this  further investigations were requested. His blood test showed an elevated white cell count and ESR. Blood cultures were drawn and staphylococcus aureus was isolated  which confirmed the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  Impression: Mr. Smith  a 65-year-old male with a clinical background of hypertension and diabetes type 2  presented with weight loss  fatigue  fever  and shortness of breath. He has been found to have native-valve infective endocarditis caused by staphylococcus aureus.  These comorbid conditions and his age put him at an increased risk for complications  including stroke and heart failure  hence warranting immediate hospital admission for infective endocarditis appropriate treatment.
14,1,31,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial31,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a primary presentation of persistent fevers  generalized malaise  and an unintentional weight loss of around 10 pounds over the last month or two. He also reports occasional night sweats and a recent decrease in appetite. These symptoms initially triggered his visit to our facility for medical evaluation.  In acquiring a thorough past medical history  the patient revealed a previous diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (Type II) and Hypertension  both of which have been managed with medication. He used to chronically smoke a pack of cigarettes per day for about 40 years before quitting five years ago. He drinks alcohol socially and denies the use of any illicit drugs. He had a minor surgical intervention for gallstones about ten years ago. There is no history of any cardiovascular disease in his family.  On physical examination  the patient appeared fatigued. His oral examination revealed poor dentition. A heart examination revealed the presence of a new heart murmur. This  combined with his other findings and symptoms  were suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Fecting on this information  it is clear that his hypertension and diabetes pose some threat to the current diagnosis. Also  his chronic smoking might have further contributed to the development and/or worsening of this condition. Therefore  it is recommended to keep him under medical surveillance and immediately start with antibiotic treatment after obtaining cultures. He should also be educated about maintaining good oral hygiene to prevent further complications. If there are no signs of improvement  he may need a cardiac intervention to manage his condition.
14,1,32,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial32,Introduction:   Today I would like to present a case of a 58-year-old Caucasian male presenting with native-valve infective endocarditis.   Demographics:   The patient  Mr. X  is a full-time employee working in a recycling plant. He lives with his wife and has two grown-up children. He is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol. He does not have any known drug allergies.  Medical History:   Mr. X has a past medical history of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and was diagnosed with it at the age of 45. He has been managing his diabetes with oral hypoglycaemic agents since his diagnosis. He has no history of cardiac disease  hypertension  or hyperlipidemia. No surgical history has been mentioned. However  he did have a dental extraction procedure done about four weeks ago.   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. X initially presented with a high-grade fever with chills that was ongoing for the past week. At the onset  he was self-medicating with over-the-counter fever reducers. However  as the fever persisted  he developed additional symptoms including fatigue  loss of appetite and weight loss. He also noticed the appearance of a few small  dark red spots on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet  which were mildly painful to the touch.   As he further continued to feel unwell  he decided to access medical care. Upon initial examination  a cardiac murmur was noted which lead to further investigations  and the definitive diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   This presentation reinforces the need for close monitoring of patients with a history of invasive procedures like dental extraction  especially those who are immunocompromised like Mr. X  who is a diabetic patient. Early recognition and management are crucial to prevent complications and improve outcomes. It is always essential to maintain a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis for patients who present with persistent fever accompanied by other non-specific signs and symptoms.
14,1,33,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial33,Title: Case Presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile: Name: Mr. J.P Smith Age: 56 years old Sex: Male Occupation: Construction foreman Race: Caucasian   Chief Complaint: Mr. Smith complains of an unexplained weight loss  intermittent fever  chills  muscle aches  and night sweats prevalent for the past four weeks.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith is a known hypertensive patient controlled on medication (Lisinopril) for the past 10 years  and he has a 15-year history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. He admits to poor adherence to his diabetic medications (Metformin and Insulin). He also reported a history of tobacco and alcohol use. He quit smoking 2 years ago but continues to drink alcohol socially. No prior history of any cardiac disease or invasive medical procedures is in record. His family exhibits no indications of genetic cardiac diseases.   Clinical Assessment: Physical examination revealed a paler than normal appearance and moderate splenomegaly. A cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur consistent with aortic regurgitation. He was found to be febrile  with an oral temperature of 38.4°C.   Diagnostic Evaluation: Laboratory tests indicated a higher than normal white blood cell count and elevated ESR  suggesting a prolonged inflammatory response. Mr. Smith's HbA1c was also notably high at 9.0%. Echocardiography revealed vegetations on the aortic valve indicative of infective endocarditis. Two separate blood cultures isolated Staphylococcus aureus that confirms bacterial endocarditis.  Conclusion: Given his clinical presentation and diagnostic evidence  Mr. Smith seemingly suffers from native-valve infective endocarditis predominantly due to Staphylococcus aureus. His uncontrolled diabetes is a potential predisposing factor for the infection.  Plan: Mr. Smith would be transferred to the in-patient ward for intravenous antibiotic therapy and closely monitored for potential complications such as arrhythmia  heart failure  and systemic embolism. We also plan to educate him on better diabetes management practices and adherence to medication regime. Regular follow-up is essential for monitoring his ongoing heart health.
14,1,34,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial34,Patient Profile: John Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presents reporting increased fatigue  shortness of breath  and intermittent fever for the past four weeks.  Medical History: Mr. Doe has had a significant past medical history including Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus well controlled on Metformin. He had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) five years ago with no residual deficits. Mr. Doe also suffers from hypertension  for which he has been managing well with Lisinopril. He is a former smoker and quit smoking 15 years ago. Mr. Doe reports occasional alcohol use and denies any illicit drug use. His family history is significant for Ischemic Heart Disease and Hypertension.   Presenting Symptoms: Over the past four weeks  he has noticed an increased level of fatigue and shortness of breath  which has become progressively worse. He has also been experiencing intermittent fevers up to 38.5 degrees Celsius. He reports loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss. He denies any lower extremity edema or anginal chest pain. However  he admits to a transient episode of confusion he experienced ten days ago that lasted a few minutes.   Upon physical examination: The patient is ill-looking with mild pallor. His heart rate was irregular  and a pansystolic murmur was heard on cardiac auscultation. There are no visible signs of heart failure.   From the patient’s history and physical examination  the combination of constitutional symptoms  cardiac murmur  and past medical history suggest possible native-valve infective endocarditis. More definitive diagnosis will require further investigations including blood cultures and an echocardiogram. Emergent management would involve empirical antibiotics treatment. These findings need to be interpreted with caution as Mr. Doe is at a higher risk of complications due to his age  diabetes  and past CVA  therefore needs careful monitoring.
14,1,35,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial35,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 50-year-old Hispanic male  Gustavo  who complains of recurrent fevers and a loss of appetite with unintentional weight loss of 8kg over two months. His symptoms also include profuse sweating  especially at night  along with fatigue and shortness of breath.  Demographics:   Gustavo resides in a suburban mid-income area. He is a nonsmoker  consumes alcohol occasionally  and denies any illicit drug usage. His occupation is in construction contracting. His family history reveals his father passed away from heart disease at 68 years of age  and his mother suffers from type-2 diabetes.  Past Medical History:  Gustavo has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which is kept under control with amlodipine. In addition to that  patient also has a history of dental abscess 8 weeks ago for which he underwent incision and drainage followed by a one week course of amoxicillin. He has no known drug allergies and has been fully compliant with his medications. His immunizations are up to date.   Upon further investigation  Gustavo has a previous history of heart murmurs dating back to his 30s  and his condition has progressed into mild mitral valve regurgitation. His last echocardiogram  performed one year ago  was stable without any hemodynamic compromise.   Summary:  In summary  Gustavo is a 50-year-old Hispanic male with a significant past medical history of hypertension  mitral valve disease  and a recent dental abscess now presenting with fevers  night sweats  appetite loss  and weight loss suggestive of infective endocarditis. Next step will be to carry out further investigations including routine blood investigations  echocardiogram and blood cultures. His recent dental procedure could be the port of entry for bacteria causing native valve infective endocarditis.

He denies any tobacco use  alcohol or drug abuse. He has no known allergies.  Past Medical History:   He has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin and insulin pen  for the past 10 years. Additionally  the patient has a history of essential hypertension  controlled with lisinopril and amlodipine for the last 7 years. The patient’s condition remained stable until three months ago  when he complained of persistent  low-grade fever  weight loss  and malaise. He also reported occasional night sweats and arthralgia. He denies chest pain  cough  shortness of breath  or gastrointestinal complaints.   The patient further states that he has not traveled abroad recently and his annual flu vaccinations are up to date. He claims to maintain good oral hygiene  brushes twice a day and visit a dentist annually  the last visit was six months ago for routine cleaning with no lack of dental problems. The patient has no known family history of heart disease.   Given these symptoms  the patient underwent an evaluation which revealed a presence of a vegetation on echocardiogram suggestive of infective endocarditis. The condition appears to be native valve infective endocarditis  affecting the mitral valve.   In conclusion  our patient  with no known history of IV drug use  valvular disease  or intracardiac devices  is a case of native valve infective endocarditis which appears to be late-onset. This case serves as a reminder that although the condition erupts acutely  under certain circumstances it may have a more indolent course and be diagnosed later in the disease process. The rigorous management strategy was implemented for this patient that included antimicrobial therapy and continuous monitoring of the patient's response to treatment.   Further consultation with a cardiothoracic surgical team has been arranged for potential valve surgery perspective. We are hoping for the patient’s successful recovery with our efforts for his comprehensive cardiac care. The patient was advised of the severity of his condition and expressed an understanding of the future treatment plan. He will continue to stay under our care for follow-ups and adjustments to the treatment plan.
14,1,37,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial37,Patient Presentation:  We are presenting the case of Mr. John Doe  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  who has presented with symptoms that are highly suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Demographic Information: Mr. Doe is a local resident and lives with his wife. He is a retired construction worker. He has a one-pack-per-day cigarette habit for the past 40 years but denies any consumption of alcoholic drinks. He is not on any illicit drugs. His height is 5 feet 8 inches and weight is 80 Kg  putting him within the normal body mass index range.  Medical History: Mr. Doe has a past medical history significant for Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) for which he had been taking benzathine penicillin prophylaxis until five years ago but later discontinued. He also has hypertension for which he takes Lisinopril 10 mg orally  once daily. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 15 years ago. His blood sugar levels have been relatively under control on Metformin 1000 mg  twice daily. There is no history of any cardiac surgeries  implantation of any cardiac devices  intravenous drug abuse  or recent dental procedures.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Doe presented with a two-week history of intermittent fever  malaise  weight loss  and night sweats. He also mentioned that he noticed small  painful red spots over his skin and hemorrhagic lesions on his nails which lasted for some days. He admitted to having mild difficulty breathing  especially when he lies flat.  Assessment: Physical examination revealed a grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. Tiny red spots (petechiae) were seen on the conjunctiva and the skin. His oral hygiene was relatively poor. Vital signs showed a heart rate of 95 beats per minute  blood pressure of 130/85 mm of Hg  respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min  temperature of 38.1°C.  Based on his past history of Rheumatic Heart Disease  poor oral health  and present symptoms like consistent fever and heart murmur  a high level of suspicion for infective endocarditis was considered. Further diagnostic tests such as Blood cultures  an Echo cardiogram  and ECG have been advised to confirm the diagnosis.  This case highlights the importance of recognizing the constellation of symptoms and clinical findings  especially in patients with a history of pre-existing heart valve disease to reach a timely diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening condition like infective endocarditis.
14,1,38,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial38,Presenter: Good morning  colleagues. I'm here to discuss the case of a 50-year-old African American female presenting with native-valve infective endocarditis.  The patient  Mrs. Johnson  works as an elementary school teacher in California. She's been married for 25 years and has two sons  one of whom has a history of drug abuse. Mrs. Johnson is a non-smoker and reports occasional alcohol consumption. She has no known drug allergies.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Johnson has a medical history of rheumatic fever in her late teens which resulted in minor valvular heart disease. She also has a history of well-controlled hypertension which she has managed with Lisinopril for the past 10 years. Mrs. Johnson was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago which she controls with Metformin and an individualized diet plan. She is also a carrier of Hepatitis B  contracted at birth but has had no clinical symptoms of chronic liver disease.  Presenting Complaint: Mrs. Johnson presents with one week of high-grade intermittent fever  an acute onset of shortness of breath  and generalized fatigue. She has also reported involuntary weight loss and decreased appetite.  Physical Examination: Physical examination shows a temperature of 38.6°C  heart rate of 110 bpm  and blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. She has conjunctival pallor  petechial rash on extremities and Janeway lesions – non-tender hemorrhagic macular lesions on the palms and soles. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new mild systolic murmur best heard at the apex of the heart.  In conclusion  given Mrs. Johnson's past medical history of minor valvular heart disease due to rheumatic fever  and her current presentation including symptoms suggestive of heart failure and physical signs like Janeway Lesions  her clinical profile is highly suggestive of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis. Further diagnostics  including blood cultures and an echocardiogram  are being arranged to confirm this presumptive diagnosis.
14,1,39,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial39,Title: Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Patient  Patient Information:   Mr. John Doe is a 68-years-old Caucasian male presenting with signs of heart failure. He lives in San Francisco  CA  and is a retired engineer.   Presenting Symptoms:   Mr. Doe has noted persistent low-grade fever and lethargy for the past few weeks. He complains of increased shortness of breath on exertion  difficulty lying flat  and swollen ankles. He also reported a noticeable weight loss.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a longstanding history of uncontrolled type-2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He had an ischemic stroke 5 years back with complete resolution of symptoms following medical management and rehabilitation. He's also had myocardial infarction 2 years ago  managed with angioplasty and stenting.  Lifestyle:  He's a former smoker with a 30-pack year history whose last cigarette was 10 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially and is not physically active due to his profession. He lives alone  managing his diabetes with oral medication  and his hypertension with Lisinopril.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  Mr. Doe appears chronically ill and uncomfortable. His extremities are edematous with a grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. There's also a presentation of Janeway lesions on both hands  a common occurrence in infective endocarditis.  Diagnostic Imaging:  Echocardiography reveals mitral valve vegetations and moderate impaired systolic function. Together with his clinical presentation and the presence of positive blood cultures  he has been diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management Strategy:  The patient requires hospital admission and initiation of IV antibiotic therapy  with follow-up blood cultures to determine effectiveness. Cardiothoracic surgical consultation will be needed considering the significant valve involvement and heart failure symptoms. He also needs strict blood glucose control and modification of his hypertension treatment.   Long term plan should include encouraging lifestyle modifications to control his diabetes and hypertension better and minimize future cardiac events. Additionally  dental assessment is necessary given the potential of oral flora as a source of his infection.   Prognosis:  Native-valve infective endocarditis mortality rates lie around 20%  but substantially increase in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes  high blood pressure  stroke  and previous heart conditions – all of which Mr. Doe has. Therefore  aggressive intervention and thorough follow-up are necessary for his case.
14,1,40,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial40,Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 57-year-old Caucasian male presenting with symptoms suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis. He is employed as a construction worker and lives with his wife and two dogs.  The patient was admitted into the hospital reporting fever  malaise  night sweats  weight loss  and recent onset fatigue. There is no history of hospitalization or emergency department visits in the past year. He also reported difficulty breathing on exertion for the past couple of weeks. He denies any history of IV drug use or recent dental procedures.   Notably  he has a past medical history of untreated  mild mitral valve prolapse diagnosed ten years ago. He also has an eight-year history of type 2 diabetes which is well-controlled by metformin. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history but quit smoking five years ago. His cardiac history is otherwise unremarkable.   He denies any known drug allergies. Current medications include metformin and a daily aspirin. His immunizations are up-to-date.     His family history is significant for coronary artery disease in his father who passed away from a myocardial infarction in his 60s. His mother has a history of rheumatoid arthritis.   On physical examination  his temperature was 38.5 degrees Celsius  blood pressure was 130/85 mm of Hg  pulse was 90 beats per minute  and respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute. Cardiac examination was notable for a new holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex - suggestive of mitral regurgitation. Examination of his skin showed small  non-tender red spots on his palms and soles (Janeway lesions). No Osler nodes were felt.   In summary  we have a middle-aged male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and diabetes  presenting with constitutional symptoms  new onset exertional breathlessness  and physical signs suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis.
14,1,41,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial41,Patient Presentation:  Patient's name is Mr. Smith. He is a 62-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a two-week history of low-grade fever  chills  malaise  weakness  and a recent onset of heart palpitations. He also complained of mild shortness of breath  particularly on exertion. He noticed some small  painless red spots on his skin.  Patient's past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 40 pack-year smoking history. Social history includes working as a carpenter. He lives with his wife  and they have two adult children. His mother had a history of congestive heart failure and his father passed away due to a stroke.   On examination  he looked fatigued and slightly pale. His temperature was 100.7 °F  blood pressure 140/90 mmHg  pulse rate 90 beats per minute and regular. Little red spots (petechiae) were noticed on his palms and soles. Mildly enlarged and tender spleen was palpable. Cardiac examination revealed an early diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border.  Investigations showed elevated inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR). Blood cultures were taken and have grown Streptococcus viridans. Transthoracic echocardiogram has shown a vegetation on his native mitral valve.  This clinical picture is suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis. He was started on appropriate antibiotics after being discussed by an infectious disease specialist. He was also discussed by the cardiac team to assess for any potential needed interventions. More investigations are being planned to look for potential systemic complications of endocarditis.   Mr. Smith's significant risk factors include his age  male sex  diabetes  smoking  and possibly his occupational exposure to wood dust. His presenting symptoms and physical examination findings  along with the echocardiogram and blood cultures  provide the major criteria for diagnosis of infective endocarditis as per the Modified Duke Criteria. This case represents a common presentation of a patient with native-valve infective endocarditis.
14,1,42,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial42,Patient Information:  We are presenting a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient  Mr. Smith  who is retired and previously worked as a construction engineer. He currently resides in a suburban environment within New York City  lives with his wife and they have regular visits from their grandchildren. He is a former smoker and quit smoking 10 years ago.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Smith presented to the clinic with complaints of persistent fever  fatigue  night sweats  unexplained weight loss  malaise  and a recently developed skin rash. He also reported experiencing bouts of confusion and occasional shortness of breath.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a documented past medical history of a mild myocardial infarction approximately eight years ago  for which he underwent cardiac stenting. Since then  he has had regular yearly follow-ups and his condition had been stable. He has been routinely taking prescribed medications including Aspirin and beta-blockers. Mr. Smith also has a diagnosis of well-managed Type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he takes Metformin  and he has experienced mild hypertension  controlled by Lisinopril. He has no known allergies.  Physical Examination:  On examination  he was observed to be febrile with a temperature of 101°F. The cardiopulmonary examination revealed a new murmur heard best at the cardiac apex. A skin examination revealed a few non-blanching petechial lesions on the extensor surface of his limbs and soles. Auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur consistent with possible underlying valvular pathology.  Diagnostic Outcome:  Following the suspicion of infective endocarditis based on the aforementioned symptoms and cardiac murmur  Mr. Smith was admitted and a set of 3 blood cultures were performed. Results confirmed bacterial growth consistent with Streptococcus viridans  favoring the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  In summary  the patient's symptoms combined with the positive blood cultures and his cardiac history have led us to his current diagnosis. We are planning a course of aggressive antibiotic therapy while also ensuring vigilant monitoring of his cardiac function. Given his prior cardiac history  a consultation with a cardiothoracic surgery team may be considered for management progression.
14,1,43,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial43,Patient Presentation:  We have Mr. John Thompson  a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of type II diabetes  hypertension and mild heart failure (EF 45%). He reports no known allergies or drug intolerances. Mr. Thompson used to be an avid smoker with a pack a day habit for 40 years but he quit smoking 10 years ago.  He presented to the ER with a two-week history of experiencing intermittent fevers  sweating  fatigue  palpitations  shortness of breath  and unintentional weight loss. According to the patient  these symptoms had been progressively worsening  which triggered his ER visit. Upon further questioning  Mr. Thompson mentioned that he had also noticed small  painless  red spots on the skin  mostly on his palms and soles. He denied any recent dental procedures  intravenous drug use  or history of rheumatic heart disease.  On physical examination  he has an irregular heart rhythm with a new holosystolic murmur heard at the apex radiating to the axilla. He also has signs of peripheral emboli including Janeway lesions on his palms and soles  as well as Roth’s spots on fundoscopic examination.  Based on clinical examination and history  Mr. Thompson was suspected to have native-valve infective endocarditis. Further diagnostic procedures  including blood cultures and an echocardiogram  were performed and the patient was admitted for further management including intravenous antibiotics. His recent worsening health conditions and the new murmur observed are significant clinical indicators of a possible infective endocarditis. Further follow-up will be carried out based on his response to treatment. 
14,1,44,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial44,Title: Case Presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  I. Demographic Information: Patient Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 56 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Construction Worker Residence: Rural Nebraska  II. Chief Complaint: The patient reports experiencing persistent fever  fatigue  and night sweats for the past two weeks. He also noted a significant weight loss during this period  about 10 pounds.  III. Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a known history of mild hypertension controlled by medication (lisinopril) and hyperlipidemia treated with simvastatin. He was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II five years ago and has been managing it with metformin and a balanced diet. He also has a smoking history of 30 pack-years.  Five years ago  the patient went through a dental procedure where he received inadequate prophylactic antibiotics. He has had no surgeries  allergies or hospitalizations.  IV. Family History: His family history is significant for diabetes (father) and myocardial infarction (mother  at age 65).  V. Social History: Mr. Doe lives with his wife and their two grown-up children. He smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and drinks alcohol occasionally. He denies any illicit drug use.  VI. Review of Systems: Positive for weight loss  night sweats  intermittent fever  and fatigue. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  cough  nausea  constipation  diarrhea  and joint pains. No changes in mental status noted. He has noticed few red spots on his palm which were painless and transient.  Given patient's the medical history  current clinical symptoms  and physical examination findings  we suspect that he may have a case of native-valve infective endocarditis  possibly secondary to his past inadequate prophylaxis during dental procedure. To confirm the diagnosis  we recommend further diagnostic studies – primarily blood cultures and transthoracic echocardiogram. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are critical to prevent serious complications such as valve destruction  heart failure  and systemic emboli.   VII. Summary: In conclusion  this is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension  type II diabetes  and hyperlipidemia presenting with generalized symptoms of fever  fatigue  and weight loss. The differential diagnosis is broad at this point  but given his history and physical we are considering infective endocarditis as a potential cause.

Moreover  Ms. Rhodes has no known drug allergies  and she does not report any history of alcohol intake  smoking  substance abuse  or travel outside the United States recently.  Family History: There's a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  as both her parents succumbed to myocardial infarction. Her older brother  aged 65  is currently managing his heart disease.  Physical Examination and Symptoms: Upon physical examination  she appears uncomfortable  having low-grade temperature spikes. She portrays murmur suggestive of valvular regurgitation. She also has certain manifestations of endocarditis such as Osler's nodes  noted on her fingertips  and Janeway lesions on her palms and soles.  In her blood test  there is an elevation of inflammatory markers like ESR and C-reaction protein. Initial echocardiogram findings indicated valvular vegetations  supporting the suspicion of infective endocarditis.  The range of her symptoms  including persistent  unexplained fever  fatigue  shortness of breath and other non-specific symptoms  align with a diagnostic consideration of native valve infective endocarditis.  Infectious Disease Consult & Management Plan: Her blood cultures isolated Streptococcus viridans  which underpins the diagnosis of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis. The hospital has referred her to an infectious disease consultant for optimal management.  The provisional management plan for Ms. Rhodes includes starting her on IV antibiotics  carefully monitoring her daily vitals and labs  following her antibiotic sensitivity  and considering surgical consultation if her situation worsens or doesn't demonstrate a significant improvement on antibiotic therapy.  Patient Education & Follow-Up: The patient has been educated about her condition  the importance of medication adherence and the potential need for surgical intervention. She will be closely followed for signs of congestive heart failure  arrhythmias  valvular dysfunction or any other potential complications of this disease.

He does have controlled hypertension  high cholesterol  and a mild degree of osteoarthritis in his knees. He is up-to-date with his immunizations. Two years ago  he had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) with no residual neurological deficits.   Family History:   Mr. D's father died of congestive heart failure in his 70s and his mother died of a stroke in her late 80s. Mr. D has one brother who has coronary artery disease and underwent bypass surgery.  Concern for Current Medical Issue:  Given Mr. D's symptoms and risk factors from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  there is concern for native-valve infective endocarditis. This will need to be further evaluated with blood cultures and echocardiography. The appropriate course of treatment will then need to be determined based off these findings.
14,1,47,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial47,Subject: Presentation of Mr. John Doe with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Identification: The patient is Mr. John Doe  a 56-year-old Caucasian male who lives in Topeka  Kansas with his wife and two adult children.  Chief Complaint: Mr. Doe was admitted to our facility following complaints of low-grade fever  chills  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss in the past few weeks. He has reported experiencing occasional night sweats and symptoms suggestive of heart palpitations.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has past medical history significant for hypertension  high cholesterol and diabetes mellitus. He was diagnosed with these conditions approximately 10 years ago and has maintained medical compliance with a regular regimen which includes Metformin and Lisinopril. He has no known drug allergies.   Social History: He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol moderately  with an occasional glass of wine at family dinners. He retired from his job as an engineer and now spends most of his time at home gardening.   Review of Systems: Mr. Doe has no recent history of hospitalization or invasive procedures. There are no remarkable findings on his respiratory  gastrointestinal  musculoskeletal  or neurological review of systems. Slight pallor is present  suggestive of anemia  and insomnia has recently become a significant health concern. Additionally  he has noticed a slight decrease in his appetite.  Conclusion: Based on these presenting symptoms and Mr. Doe's medical background  he underwent a series of laboratory tests and echocardiography  which revealed the presence of vegetations on his mitral valve  confirming a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. With the presence of underlying chronic conditions  protracted symptoms  and echocardiogram findings  it is crucial to commence targeted antibiotic therapy and monitor the patient's progress closely to avoid potential complications  such as septicemia  valve damage  or heart failure due to uncontrolled infection.
14,1,48,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial48,"Patient Presentation:  We have a 63-year-old Caucasian male patient  John Doe  who presents to the clinic with major health complaints  including an intermittent fever of 38.7C for the past couple of weeks  general fatigue and a noticeable weight loss.   Patient Demographics:  Mr. Doe is a retired engineer  lives with his wife. He is a former smoker with a history of 20 pack years  quit about fifteen years ago. He is not a known substance abuser nor has a history of IV drug use. He consumes alcohol only socially and in moderation.  Medical History:  His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  currently managed with oral hypoglycemic agents  and hypertension  under control with standard antihypertensive medication. He also has hyperlipidemia  controlled with statin medications. He is under regular follow-up for his chronic diseases  and his medications are well controlled. He also reports a history of a """"heart murmur"""" diagnosed in his childhood without significant symptoms.  Apparently  he appeared well until about 3 weeks ago when he began to experience low-grade fevers  more profound in the evenings  loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss.  The combination of Mr. Doe’s prolonged fever  reported heart murmur  and unspecific symptoms prompts concerns of possible infective endocarditis  which requires further evaluation. Staphylococcus aureus  Streptococcus viridans  and Enterococcus species are the most common causes of infective endocarditis.  We've planned to admit him to the hospital for further evaluation and management  including blood cultures and a trans-esophageal echocardiogram to check for vegetation and assessment of valvular damage."
14,1,49,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial49,Subject: Presentation of Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Demographic Information: Patient Name: Mr. John Doe Gender: Male Age: 54 Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Accountant  Medical History: Mr. Doe is a 54-years-old Caucasian male  non-smoker with minimal alcohol consumption  who has a history of rheumatic fever during his childhood and has been dealing with Type 2 Diabetes for the last 11 years. He has also reported episodes of hypertension for the past 5 years and maintaining the condition with regular medication. His family history includes his father  who passed away due to a myocardial infarction at age 65  and his mother who is currently alive and well at 80 years-old  with a history of osteoporosis.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Doe presented to the hospital emergency department  reporting a 2-week history of persistent low-grade fever  generalized malaise  and occasional night sweats. He complained of breathlessness during the minimal exertion and also noted that he has been experiencing intermittent episodes of joint pain  more prominent in the morning.

14,1,51,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial51,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 54-year-old Hispanic male named Mr. Rodriguez who presents with a week-long history of intermittent fever  chills and malaise. He was referred to our facility after his primary care physician noticed a heart murmur during a routine check-up. He has noted occasional night sweats but denies chest pain  cough or shortness of breath.   Past Medical History  Mr. Rodriguez has a past medical history of IV drug abuse in his younger years  for which he underwent rehabilitation and has been clean for the past 10 years. He also has a history of mild hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both controlled with oral medications.  Social History  Mr. Rodriguez is a non-smoker and an occasional drinker. He lives with his wife and works as a truck driver.  Family History  There is no family history of heart diseases but his father is a type 2 diabetic  and his mother had hypertension.  Current Medications  He is currently on metformin 500 mg twice a day for diabetes and amlodipine 5 mg once daily for hypertension.  Review of Systems  The review of systems was significant for mild fatigue and a low-grade  intermittent fever. The patient has reported no changes in appetite  weight  or sleep pattern. He denies any recent travel or sick contacts.   Physical Examination  On physical examination  the patient appeared generally well. He was alert  oriented and cooperative. He had a temperature of 100.3 F. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur best heard at apex. No skin rash  Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions were found. Other systems were unremarkable.   Given the patient’s new murmur  history of IV drug abuse and recent nonspecific symptoms such as fever  malaise and night sweats  a presumption of native-valve infective endocarditis is considered. Blood cultures were sent and he was admitted for echocardiogram and further management.

He has noticed recently that he is now experiencing significant weight loss. He comes from a lower socioeconomic background and has lived alone all his life.  MEDICAL HISTORY:   Mr. Smith has a history of long-term chronic cigarette smoking and has battled alcohol abuse  leading to alcoholic liver disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 about ten years ago  which is currently managed with oral hypoglycemic medications. He has a history of infected ulcers in the past secondary to poor diabetes control.   No previous cardiovascular history has been established  and there is no familial history of any cardiac disorders. Mr. Smith does not have a history of intravenous drug abuse. No hospitalizations within the last six months and no previous history of rheumatic heart disease or cardiac surgery.   Mr. Smith has had poor oral health leading to chronic dental infections  which may place him at risk for bacterial endocarditis.  PHYSICAL FINDINGS:  On physical examination  Mr. Smith has a full range of cardiovascular sounds with a new-onset systolic murmur on auscultation. The dental examination revealed severe dental caries and gingivitis. His overall hygiene appeared poor. He presented with pale skin  low-grade fever  dependent edema in both lower limbs  and clubbing of the fingers.  On his lab reports  abnormal blood cultures reveal positive bacterial growth. Echocardiogram demonstrated vegetations on the native valves suggestive of infective endocarditis. Other labs were remarkable with leukocytosis  mild anemia  and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates  indicating an ongoing inflammatory process.   PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSIS:  Based on the sociodemographics  medical history  physical examination  and laboratory findings  a preliminary diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis (NVE) was considered.

He is a non-smoker  casual alcohol drinker  and denies any history of illicit drug use.   II. Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Smith presents with a two-week history of low-grade  intermittent fever  malaise  muscle aches and an unexplained weight loss of around 10 pounds. He has also noticed dark spots on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet  which he describes as painless but occasionally itchy.  He also mentions that he has been having night sweats for a few days.   III. Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a known history of type II diabetes for the past 15 years  which is well controlled through oral hypoglycemic agents and diet modification. He has also been diagnosed with hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy. He had his last annual check-up six months ago  where a benign heart murmur was noticed but no further investigation was inferred due to absence of any related symptoms.  IV. Medications:  He is currently taking metformin for his diabetes  lisinopril for hypertension and tamsulosin for his benign prostatic hypertrophy.   V. Immunizations:  He is up-to-date with his annual influenza vaccines and he received pneumococcal vaccine 3 years ago. He also completed his series of shingles vaccine last year.  VI. Allergies:  Mr. Smith reports no known allergies to food  medication  or environmental factors.  Given his symptoms and the presence of the heart murmur  Mr. Smith is suspected of having native valve infective endocarditis. Further investigations and clinical management are planned accordingly.
14,1,54,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial54,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jones is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a chief complaint of consistent fever  malaise  and intermittent chest discomfort. The patient has been experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 weeks now. The erratic temperature ranges from 100 - 103°F  typically higher in the evening. Accompanying symptoms include night sweats  fatigue  and mild weight loss. Due to his ongoing fever and chest discomfort  Mr. Jones decided to seek medical help.  Mr. Jones is married  a non-smoker  and drinks alcohol only occasionally. He is retired but used to work as an engineer for a prominent tech company. The patient lives with his wife and has a supportive system of grown-up children and grandchildren. He is independent in daily activities.  Past Medical History :  Mr. Jones has a past medical history significant for aortic stenosis  diagnosed five years ago  for which he has been under regular cardiology follow-up. He was recommended surgical intervention but opted for conservative treatment. He also has a history of controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He reports no known allergies. His family history includes his father who died of stroke and mother who died of breast cancer.   Current Medications:  The patient's current medication regimen includes Enalapril 5mg daily for hypertension  and Atorvastatin 20mg nightly for hyperlipidaemia.  Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  Mr. Jones appears in no acute distress. Vital signs are normal except for a fever of 102°F. The Cardiac exam revealed a systolic murmur. During examination  small  non-painful red spots (Osler's nodes) were noted on his palms and soles  and under the fingernails  there were areas of bleeding (splinter hemorrhages).   Preliminary diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made due to the combination of fever  murmur  and other physical signs. This was later confirmed by subsequent blood cultures and transthoracic echocardiography revealing vegetations on the aortic valve. Mr. Jones's medical team scheduled him for a further evaluation and immediate treatment.
14,1,55,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial55,Patient Presentation   Name: John Doe Age: 65 Sex: Male Location: San Diego  California   Chief Complaint: Complaints of worsening fatigue  fever  and aching joint for a duration of the last two weeks.  Medical History: John Doe is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus that was diagnosed ten years ago and is managed with metformin. He also has a previous history of hypertension controlled with lisinopril for the past 15 years. He had a surgical history of a hernia repair about 20 years ago but no history of valve replacement or cardiac surgery. He lives alone  is a retired engineer and has Medicare insurance. He has no known drug allergies. His family history is notable for coronary artery disease in his father who passed away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 70. His mother has a history of arthritis.   Over the last two weeks  Mr. Doe has noticed gradually increasing fatigue  intermittent fevers  and aching joints. He also noticed shortness of breath on exertion that was not present before. Initially  he attributed the symptoms to aging and stress  but he decided to seek medical attention when his usual activities  such as grocery shopping and walking  became difficult due to his fatigue and breathlessness.  He denies the chest pain  orthopnea  and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He has no symptoms suggestive of stroke or other neurological pathologies. On review of his systems  he has lost around 5 pounds in the last couple of weeks.  Physical Examination: General appearance: He appears chronically ill  is leaning forward and is using his accessory muscles to breathe but is not in acute distress. Temperature: 38.4 degree Celsius  Blood pressure: 138/82 mmHg  Pulse: 98 bpm  Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per min  SpO2 93% on room air.  Cardiovascular Examination: He has a regular rate and rhythm with a mid-diastolic murmur best heard at the apex. Pulmonary examination: Decreased breath sounds on bases with coarse crackles have been found on auscultation. No signs of peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis  including Janeway's lesions  Osler's nodes  or Roth spots  were observed.   Differential Diagnosis includes infective endocarditis  pneumonia  viral or bacterial infection  autoimmune diseases  neoplasms  and anemia due to different causes. Urgent investigations including CBC  chest x-ray  blood cultures  autoimmune workup  and Echocardiogram are ordered. Treatment must be individualized according to the pathogen identified. Empiric antibiotic treatment might be started based on the clinical findings of infection and sepsis  likely source and local resistance patterns.
14,1,56,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial56,Slide 1: Introduction The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired school teacher  with a history of moderate tobacco use and social alcohol consumption.  Slide 2: Presenting Symptoms  He is presenting with a three-week onset of unrelenting fever  night sweats  weight loss  and vague musculoskeletal pain. The patient also reports a new heart murmur and recent onset of easy fatigability.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  This patient's past medical history is significant for rheumatic heart disease diagnosed in his late 20s. He has been treated with prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures. He also notes long-standing  well-controlled hypertension and had an episode of deep venous thrombosis five years ago after a long-haul flight. He has no known drug allergies.   Slide 4: Social History  The patient lives with his wife and has no history of illicit drug use. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking but quit five years ago. He admits to moderate alcohol use  with an average of one to two drinks per day.   Slide 5: Family History  His family history includes coronary artery disease in his father who experienced a heart attack at age 55  a mother with hypertension and a sister with adult-onset diabetes.    Slide 6: Potential Diagnosis Given the combination of his systemic symptoms  new heart murmur  history of rheumatic heart disease and his echocardiography findings  the working diagnosis is native-valve infective endocarditis. This is further supported by his moderate risk profile  given his prior heart disease and the presence of valvular abnormality.   Slide 7: Further Tests  Further diagnostic tests that may be beneficial include blood tests for complete blood count and differential  renal function  liver function tests  and obtaining blood for cultures before initiating antibiotics therapy.   Slide 8: Proposed Treatment Prompt treatment should be started to improve survival probability. The treatment includes prolonged antibiotics administration for at least 4-6 weeks and surgery may be indicated depending on the patient's clinical progress.  Slide 9: Prognosis Endocarditis carries a high risk of complications  including heart damage and systemic infections. Timely diagnosis and treatment are critical to improving prognosis and decreasing morbidity and mortality.
14,1,57,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial57,Patient Presentation  I am presenting Mr. John Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian male with native-valve infective endocarditis. He hails from Philadelphia and is a retired bank executive. He and his wife of 40 years live together  they are nonsmokers and are conservatives when it comes to alcohol consumption. He came to our clinic presenting with a 1-month history of intermittent fevers  night sweats  fatigue  and a loss of appetite. He reports unintentional weight loss over the past 3 weeks.  Past Medical History  Mr. Smith has a past medical history significant for Type II diabetes  controlled with metformin and lifestyle modifications. His diabetes is well under control with a recent HbA1C level of 6.5%. He additionally suffers from hypertension which is managed effectively with a daily regimen of Lisinopril. He had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago but recovered well after undergoing angioplasty. Mr. Smith has not received any dental care in the last two years. His last colonoscopy  3 years ago  was normal.  There is no history of illicit drug use  tattoos  recent travel  or close contact with sick people. From his personal history  he's not allergic to any food or drugs. Childhood immunizations were received as per the schedule and he had received his annual flu shot.  Family history is significant for heart disease in both parents  his father had congestive heart failure and his mother had a stroke. His two siblings are alive and well with no significant medical history.  Upon physical examination  he appeared ill and had a fever of 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Cardiovascular examination showed a diastolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border. Labs were drawn  including blood cultures. He was subsequently admitted and started on empiric antibiotic therapy.  Mr. Smith's case is consistent with native‐valve infective endocarditis. His symptoms  along with the finding of a heart murmur and the significant positive family history of heart disease  are all consistent with this diagnosis. The next steps will be to conduct an ECHO and adjust his antibiotics based on culture sensitivities. With appropriate treatment  he stands a good chance of making a full recovery.
14,1,58,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial58,Patient Presentation:  Today we have a 60-year-old African-American male patient known as Mr. A who is presenting with symptoms indicative of native-valve infective endocarditis. Born and raised in Nebraska  he worked as a construction worker for 35 years  has been a two-pack-a-day smoker for the past 40 years  and reports occasional excessive alcohol intake. He is a widower and lives alone since his wife passed away 2 years ago. He has 2 adult children who live in different states.   Past Medical History:  Mr. A has a past medical history significant for several health issues. He was diagnosed with type II diabetes at the age of 45  which has been poorly controlled. He also suffers from hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he has been on antihypertensive meds and statins respectively. Despite advice from his previous healthcare providers  he has a history of noncompliance with his medications. He also had a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) seven years ago  for which he underwent angioplasty and was started on daily aspirin and other post-MI medications.   About a week ago  he had some dental work done during which he developed a tooth infection and was placed on antibiotics. He is allergic to penicillin; however  his other drug allergies are unknown.  Current Condition:  Mr. A arrived at the emergency department complaining of high-grade fever  malaise  progressive shortness of breath  and fatigue that has worsened over the last two weeks. On physical examination  Osler's nodes were visible (indicative of vasculitis)  along with Janeway lesions on his palms and soles. He has a new murmur upon cardiac auscultation suggestive of valvular regurgitation. These symptoms  in conjunction with his previous dental infection  make us suspect the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis.  We are planning to conduct complete blood works  including blood cultures  and an Echocardiogram for a definitive diagnosis. Pending results  we are considering initiation of empirical antimicrobial treatment. Additionally  his diabetes and hypertension management will be revisited to prevent further complications. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor treatment response and disease progression. Managing Mr. A's case comprehensively will involve addressing his smoking and alcohol consumption habits  ensuring adherence to his prescribed medications  and providing him with psychological support.
14,1,59,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial59,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 73-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Robert Jenkins. He is a retired mechanic and lives with his wife in Boston  Massachusetts. He is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic  and leads an active lifestyle which includes a regular walking routine and gardening activities.   Past Medical History Mr. Jenkins has a documented history of type II diabetes mellitus for the past ten years  which is well-controlled with Metformin. He underwent a successful angioplasty procedure for angina five years ago. The patient also suffers from mild hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are managed with medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin). He has no known drug allergies. There is no documented history of illicit drug use  and no family history of infective endocarditis or any cardiac diseases.   Presenting Complaint and Examination Mr. Jenkins presented to the emergency department with complaints of a high-grade fever  chills  fatigue  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss for the past two weeks. He also reported a decreased appetite and shortness of breath  especially on exertion.   On physical examination  he appeared pale and lethargic. Auscultation revealed a new onset cardiac murmur over the mitral area. Minimal leg edema was also noted. His body temperature was elevated at 38.5 degrees Celsius.   This presentation is consistent with possible native-valve infective endocarditis given his new onset of a cardiac murmur coupled with his systemic symptoms of fever and malaise. Further investigations  including blood cultures and an echocardiogram  have been requested to confirm the diagnosis.
14,1,60,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial60,Patient Presentation  I would like to present a patient  Mr. J  a 65-year-old Caucasian male recently diagnosed with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVE). Mr. J has been living in an urban setting of New York City  is a retired engineer  and a non-smoker. He has a history of chronic hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which have been well-managed with long-term medication. He does not have any known allergies. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at the age of 58 and has been on metformin therapy since then. He admits to being non-compliant with his diet  and his most recent HbA1c was elevated at 8%.   About two months ago  Mr. J had a dental extraction after which he did not take the prescribed course of antibiotics. This is the likely time when the transient bacteremia seeded his native valves and potentially set the stage for his current condition. He has since been experiencing malaise  fatigue  intermittent fever  and a recent unexpected weight loss. His family members have noticed that he is often confused and lethargic  which is not his normal baseline behavior.   Cardiac examination findings showed a new murmur consistent with aortic insufficiency. Besides  numerous blood cultures have isolated Streptococcus viridians. Echocardiography has confirmed vegetation on his aortic valve with moderate regurgitation suggestive of NVE. Neurologically  he also had couple of transient ischemic attacks  probably as a result of septic emboli. Rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  To summarize  Mr. J is a 65-year-old male with significant cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. His current condition of NVE is likely a consequence of a dental procedure followed by lack of prophylactic antibiotics. It seems to be complicated by heart valve damage and systemic embolization causing neurological impairment.
14,1,61,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial61,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 45-year-old Caucasian male  who works as an accountant and belongs to a middle-class socioeconomic background. He has been living in the urban suburbs.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of intravenous drug use in his early 20s  but he has been clean for the past 15 years. He has a positive medical history for chronic Hepatitis C infection due to his previous IV drug use. He is also a long-term smoker  prone to smoking about 15-20 cigarettes a day. He does not have a history of any major illness or surgery but was recently diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus Type II  for which he is under oral hypoglycemic agents. He does not have any known allergies.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presents with a week-long history of persistent fever  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss. He is also complaining of general weakness  muscle aches  a new heart murmur  and blood in the urine. He has not encountered this combination of symptoms before and identifies the fever as being quite high  sometimes reaching 102°F. He has also been feeling unusually fatigued  even when performing minor tasks.  Overall  his symptoms  medical history  and lifestyle can indicate a possible case of native valve infective endocarditis. Further  diagnostic tests are required to confirm the diagnosis  including blood cultures and transthoracic echocardiography. It is imperative to define the causative pathogen in order to start the patient on the suitable antibiotic treatment as soon as possible.   Concluding  this case highlights the importance of considering early diagnosis and treatment of native-valve infective endocarditis  especially in patients with a past medical history that predisposes them to this condition. In such cases  a multidisciplinary approach involving a team of cardiologists  infectious disease specialists  and often cardiac surgeons  should be initiated for improving patient outcomes.
14,1,62,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial62,Title: A Clinical Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Presentation: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the hospital with symptoms of fatigue  unexplained weight loss  low-grade fever  night sweats  and a new heart murmur. He reports his symptoms have been getting progressively worse over the past month. He especially complains about feeling extremely tired even with minimal exertion.  Demographics: The patient is a retired engineer. He lives with his wife in their apartment in the city. He denies usage of any recreational drugs  excessive alcohol  or frequent smoking.   Medical History: His medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents  and hypertension. He has been taking an ace inhibitor for this condition. He also received dental work  specifically tooth extraction  two months ago for which he did not take any prophylactic antibiotics. He reports no known allergies to medicines. He has been hospitalized once previously due to a minor stroke approximately five years ago and retains no major residual disabilities from it. He is not on any anticoagulation.   Family History: His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease; his father died of myocardial infarction at 68 years  and his brother has angina. He denies any family history of rheumatic heart disease or any congenital heart anomalies.  Physical Examination: On physical exam  the patient appeared chronically ill and fatigued. He has a blood pressure of 140/90  pulse rate of 90 bpm  temperature of 38.3C  and respiratory rate of 18 per minute. Cardiac exams reveal the presence of a new cardiac murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation. Small  non-tender spots (Janeway lesions) are observed on his palms and soles. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  Conclusion: Based on clinical findings and history provided  there is a high suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis in this patient  likely secondary to the dental procedure carried out two months ago. Further diagnostic procedures such as blood cultures and echocardiogram are needed to confirm the diagnosis and guide the treatment in this case. The patient requires immediate hospitalization and treatment to prevent further damage to his heart and potential complications.   Thank you so much for your attention. I am now open to any questions regarding this case.
14,1,63,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial63,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Senior Male Patient  Patient Profile: - Name: Mr. X  - Age: 67 years - Sex: Male - Ethnic Background: Hispanic   Presenting Issue: Mr. X reports a consistent fever over the last 3 weeks  and has been feeling generally unwell with a lack of energy and a marked decrease in appetite. He has reported recent unintentional weight loss and night sweats. He was brought to the ER by his daughter after he experienced a brief loss of consciousness.  Medical History: Mr. X has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and dyslipidemia. He has no known drug allergies. He is a former smoker  quit 10 years ago  and consumes alcohol socially. He does not have a history of illicit drug use. He has never been diagnosed with heart disease before  and there is no indication of intravenous drug use or immunosuppression. Mr. X had dental work done approximately one month ago.   Assessment and Plan: Initial physical exams showed he was febrile with a heart murmur. Blood culture results are pending. The presence of fever plus the new onset murmur suggests possible infective endocarditis. We are proceeding with the Duke Criteria for diagnosis and are arranging an Echocardiogram to visualize the heart valves and look for signs of vegetation indicative of infective endocarditis.   If the suspicion for infective endocarditis is confirmed  the patient will be prescribed a course of intravenous antibiotics and will be closely monitored. Also  the team will seek the consultation of a cardiologist and other specialists as appropriate  based on the evolution of the patient’s symptoms.  Conclusion: Mr. X's confirmed diagnoses  optimal management  and patient education on future preventive measures will be determined based on lab results  imaging findings  and collaboration with the cardiology team. Given his advanced age and comorbid conditions  careful attention will be given to the management of this patient's potentially serious condition.

Mr. Doe is currently admitted to the hospital for continuous monitoring of vital signs and for the initiation of possible empirical antibiotic therapy as patient fits into the moderate risk group for endocarditis.
14,1,65,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial65,Title: Infected Native Valve Endocarditis in a 65-Year-Old Male  Introduction Our patient is a 65-year-old male who has presented with symptoms indicating native-valve infective endocarditis  a condition characterized by infection caused by microorganisms of the heart valves within the cardiac cavity.  Demographics The patient is a Caucasian male  non-smoker  with occasional alcohol consumption. He is retired and living with his wife in a rural area. He has no known drug allergies.  Symptoms The presenting symptoms include persistent fever  malaise  loss of appetite  weight loss  and night sweats. He also reports having splinter hemorrhages under his nails  and Osler nodes (painful red nodes) on his fingers and toes. Upon inspection  Janeway lesions  or small erythematous or hemorrhagic macular or nodular lesions on the palms and soles  were also noted. The patient presented with a new murmur  suggestive of valvular disease  which was absent in his last physician visit three months back.  Past Medical History The patient's medical history is significant  as he has a history of untreated dental infection six months ago  which could possibly be the source of his current endocarditis. He has controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally  he has been treated for hypertension for the last 10 years. Furthermore  he successfully underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery around 5 years back.  Family History The patient's family medical history reveals that both of his parents suffered from cardiovascular diseases. His father died of a heart attack and his mother had a stroke.   Conclusion Given the patient's symptoms and medical history  he has been diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. The most likely organisms causing infective endocarditis due to the dental source could be viridans group Streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus. Further diagnostic investigations  including blood cultures and echocardiograms  have been recommended for the confirmation of the causal microorganism and to evaluate the degree of valvular damage.   This patient is at high risk and requires aggressive medical management  possibly including hospitalization  heavy-duty antibiotics  and  if deemed necessary by the cardiology team  he may need surgical intervention to repair or replace the damaged heart valves. Regular follow-ups would also be needed to monitor his condition.
14,1,66,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial66,Patient Presentation  Our subject patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male presenting with native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient lives with his spouse in an urban part of Detroit  Michigan and has been employed as a construction worker for over 40 years. This individual is a former smoker  having quit cigarette use around 15 years ago  and has a moderate alcohol consumption habit  partaking most nights.  This patient has been previously diagnosed with several comorbidities that are important in the context of this case. Firstly  the patient has a 10-year history of uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus that has been primarily managed through diet and oral antidiabetic medication  including Metformin  which he has routine difficulties adhering to. Approximately 8 years ago  he was diagnosed with coronary artery disease for which he had an elective percutaneous intervention  and now regularly takes lifelong low-dose aspirin.  Regarding his social history  the patient lives with his wife and has excellent support at home. He is a grandfather to 6 grandchildren and often spends time babysitting them. Despite his chronic illnesses  he continues to be relatively active and enjoys golfing and socializing with friends.  His endocarditis current presentation started around 2 weeks ago with non-specific symptoms of fatigue  anorexia  some weight loss  and an intermittent low-grade fever predominantly in the evening times. Over the last 3-4 days  he has developed a cough and shortness of breath on exertion. He has no previous history of illicit drug use  dental procedures  or recent invasive procedures.  In summary  this is a case of a 67-year-old male who  despite his high-risk profile due to uncontrolled diabetes  coronary artery disease  and moderate alcohol consumption  was able to present at an early stage for medical consultation due to his good home support system. His social history and past medical history provide valuable insight into his overall medical management and prognosis through his infective endocarditis course.
14,1,67,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial67,Slide 1: Introduction  Good afternoon  today I will present a case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE).  Slide 2: Patient Information  Patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  previously residing in an urban setting. He is retired  with a past occupation as a mechanical engineer.  Slide 3: Patient History  The patient has a significant medical history which includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes. Additionally  he has previously been a smoker with a 30-pack year history. His only prior surgical history includes appendectomy at age 22. There is no known family history of endocarditis. He is currently on Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.  Slide 4: Presentation of Symptoms  The patient presented with a 2 week history of malaise  night sweats  shortness of breath  and orthopnea. He also reported a non-productive cough  low-grade fever  and a weight loss of 5kg over a month. No history of chest pain  headache  rash  or recent dental work.  Slide 5: Physical Examination  Examination revealed peripheral stigmata of endocarditis including splinter hemorrhages in the nail beds  Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes  and conjunctival hemorrhages. A diastolic murmur was heard best at the apex  suggestive of Mitral regurgitation. No other abnormal findings were apparent on examination.  Slide 6: Investigation  Upon initial investigation  the patient was found to have leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markersErythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). A Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed a vegetative lesion on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve  indicative of infective endocarditis. Blood cultures are pending.  Slide 7: Diagnosis  Given the clinical  laboratory  and imaging findings  the patient was diagnosed with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis.  In conclusion  timely diagnosis and proper management are imperative in NVIE cases to ensure optimal patient outcomes and minimize morbidity and mortality rates. This patient's condition requires immediate interventions including empirical antibiotic therapy  followed by targeted treatment based on blood culture and sensitivity results  and possibly surgical approach if medical treatment fails.
14,1,68,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial68,Title: Case Presentation on Endocarditis in Native-Valve  Patient Details:  Mr. Johnson  a 68-year-old African American male  presents with a chronic cough  high fever  rapid weight loss  and generalized malaise. He resides in the urban area of Philadelphia  Pennsylvania and is retired from his job as a principal in a high school. He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. His body mass index (BMI) is 29.4. His family history is significant for diabetes and hypertension.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a well-documented history of rheumatic fever at the age of 17  which suggests potential damage to the heart valves. Over the past 10 years  he has been treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Diabetes is controlled by oral hypoglycemic agents and he uses calcium channel blockers for hypertension. He has no known allergies to medications.  Current Physical and Diagnostic Evaluation:  On physical examination  he appears tired. His pulse rate was 98 beats per minute  blood pressure at 140/80 mmHg  and he had a fever of 100.4 F. Cardiac auscultation revealed a grade III systolic murmur best heard at the apex. Laboratory data showed high leukocyte count indicating a possible infection. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans  a common organism implicated in endocarditis. Echocardiogram suggested thickening and vegetation on the mitral valve  supporting a diagnosis of infective endocarditis. No other abnormality was detected in the remaining examinations.  In conclusion  considering Mr. Johnson's medical history  clinical manifestations  laboratory results  and echocardiogram findings  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is most consistent. The patient requires immediate hospitalization and initiation of an appropriate antibiotic regimen. Further evaluation is needed to decide the requirement for possible surgical intervention. 
14,1,69,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial69,Subject: Patient Presentation – Native-valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Identification: We are presenting a 62-year-old male  Caucasian  known as Mr. Johnson Jones  currently residing in Long Beach  California. He is a retired teacher and lives with his wife. Mr. Jones is primarily English speaking and a non-smoker. The patient has not traveled abroad recently and has no known occupational risks.  Present Illness: Mr. Jones presents with a two weeks history of intermittent high-grade fever  fatigue  loss of appetite  weight loss  and night sweats. He has also noted increasing discomfort in his chest region and shortness of breath on exertion. He mentioned having mild joint and muscle pains as well. His wife noticed that he looked slightly pale.  Past Medical History: Mr. Jones has a past medical history significant for uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He was diagnosed with these conditions ten years ago and has been receiving medications for the same. His medications include Metformin 500mg twice daily and Lisinopril 20mg once daily. He also has a history of stable angina defined by occasional chest discomfort with strenuous activity or stress. Mr. Jones has no history of IV drug use or a recent dental procedure.

14,1,70,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial70,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male named John. He works as a truck driver and lives with his wife and two dogs in a suburban home in Portland  Oregon. John is a heavy smoker with a 30-year pack history and is a moderate drinker. He denies use of illicit drugs.   In terms of past medical history  John suffers from Type II Diabetes Mellitus which is controlled through oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has hyperlipidemia  well controlled on statin therapy. He does not have any personal or family history of rheumatic fever or any other cardiac disease. He had a successful hernia repair surgery 10 years ago.   Recently  he's been suffering from a persistent fever that varies 100.4 to 101.3 °F  a new heart murmur  and unexplained weight loss for about a month. John also reported experiencing night sweats  malaise  and weakness. He has not traveled recently and does not recall any recent tick bites or similar events.   Given the duration of his symptoms and the lack of a clear alternative source of infection  a presumption of native-valve infective endocarditis has been considered. Appropriate diagnostics will be needed to confirm this diagnosis and guide management. This should include blood cultures  inflammatory markers and echocardiography.
14,1,71,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial71,Patient Profile:  - Name: Mr. John Doe - Age: 57 years - Sex: Male - Occupation: Construction worker - Ethnic background: African American - Marital status: Married  Presentation:  Mr. Doe presents to the clinic with complaints of persistent high-grade fever with temperatures ranging between 100 °F - 103 °F for the past two weeks. Accompanying the fever are night sweats  fatigue and loss of appetite leading to weight loss. He reports a new onset of a heart murmur  shortness of breath  and occasional chest discomfort. Additionally  he has noted some red tender spots under the skin of his fingers and toes and petechiae on his palate.  Past Medical History:  1. Diabetes Mellitus type 2 controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents for the past 7 years. 2. Hypertension  also well controlled with medication for 5 years. 3. History of Heavy Alcohol consumption and Smoking for 30 years.  Physical examination revealed a mid-diastolic murmur on auscultation suggesting a probable valvular heart disease. Complete blood count showed raised white cell count suggestive of an ongoing infection  and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate indicating inflammation. Blood cultures have been sent and awaiting results.  Given his high-risk profession being a construction worker which exposes him to multiple infectious agents  his lifestyle choices  and the new onset of heart murmur  all point towards a strong possibility of infective endocarditis affecting his native heart valves.   Treatment is deferred until blood culture results and antigen detection to confirm the infective organism and further management would be decided. Education for lifestyle modification has been provided given his previous medical history and current suspected diagnosis.  
14,1,72,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial72,Title: Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-aged Female   Introduction:  Our patient  Mrs. A  is a 45-year-old Caucasian female with a history of rheumatic heart disease and intermittent intravenous drug use. She is a resident of Los Angeles  California and works as an elementary school teacher. Her familial history reveals a prevalence of cardiac disease on her paternal side.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. A had rheumatic fever at the age of 13  that led to rheumatic heart disease  characterized by stenosis of the mitral and aortic valves. She has been managed on a regimen of penicillin prophylaxis and diuretics for her mitral valve disease with regular follow-ups with her cardiologist. She has no other known comorbidities such as diabetes  hypertension  or hyperlipidemia. However  Mrs. A also has a history of intermittent intravenous drug use  mainly heroin  which she first disclosed to her healthcare provider 5 years ago. She has been in and out of rehab facilities but struggles to maintain consistent sobriety  a known risk factor for infective endocarditis.  Presenting Complaint:  Mrs. A presents to our clinic today reporting a 2-week history of intermittent fever  fatigue and generalized weakness. She mentions associated symptoms of loss of appetite  severe joint pain and unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds in a month. She denies any recent dental procedures  but admits to a few episodes of injecting drugs over the past month.  Examination Findings:  Initial evaluation indicates that she is febrile with a temperature of 102°F. Cardiovascular examination reveals a new diastolic murmur heard best at the apex. Fundoscopic examination notes the presence of Roth spots and her palms exhibit Janeway lesions.   Impression:  The patient's history of rheumatic heart disease and recent intravenous drug use  along with her clinical signs and symptoms  raise a high suspicion for infective endocarditis affecting her native valves. Further investigations  including blood cultures and an echocardiogram  are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and to guide the choice of antibiotic therapy.  It is important to manage Mrs. A's condition promptly to prevent further complications such as heart failure  arrhythmias  systemic embolization  and other life-threatening complications that may arise due to untreated infective endocarditis. Simultaneously  a comprehensive plan to address her substance use disorder is also crucial.
14,1,73,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial73,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. John Smith  presenting with symptoms that suggest native-valve infective endocarditis.  Mr. Smith is from Cleveland  Ohio  and has been married for 35 years. He has two adult children and three grandchildren. He has worked as a factory worker for over 30 years. He reports a history of moderate alcohol consumption but denies any history of smoking or illicit drug use.  In terms of comorbidities  Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension and rheumatic fever during childhood. He has been medically managed for both conditions without any complications. He also has a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus  which he manages with insulin and diet.  Clinical Presentation:  Mr. Smith presents today with a one-week history of lethargy  intermittent fever  night sweats  and a new-onset heart murmur. He noticed his symptoms while gardening and initially attributed them to his physically demanding job and seasonal changes. He sought medical help when these symptoms persisted and his fatigue levels affected his ability to perform daily activities.  On examination  his blood pressure is relatively stable  however  he has tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute. Auscultation of his chest reveals a diastolic murmur. His respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are within normal limits. Oral examination reveals mild gingival bleeding and erythema.  These symptoms align with the clinical presentation of infective endocarditis  often seen in patients with a background of rheumatic fever and poor dental hygiene  as indicated by the observed gingival inflammation.  Next steps in management would typically include confirmatory blood cultures and a transesophageal echocardiogram. 
14,1,74,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial74,Title: Presentation of a Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Patient  Patient Information: We present a case of a 63-year-old male patient named Mr. John Thomas. He is a White American  born and adult life spent mostly in San Francisco  California. He is a retired librarian  lives with his wife in a suburb  and has no living children.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Thomas initially presented with nonspecific symptoms such as low-grade fever  malaise  and mild fatigue that lasted for a few weeks. He also began to experience night sweats and weight loss  which prompted him to seek medical attention.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thomas has a history of moderate aortic stenosis which was diagnosed 8 years ago  but he was asymptomatic and thus did not undergo surgery. He also has well-controlled type 2 diabetes for which he has been taking Metformin for the past 10 years. There is no history of illicit drug use  and he quit smoking 15 years ago. He also has no known allergies. He has not previously had any surgeries or hospital admissions outside of a hernia repair twenty years prior. His immunization is up-to-date including influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations.  Clinical Findings: A physical examination revealed a diastolic murmur consistent with his known aortic valve disease. Janeway lesions were also found on his palms and soles  and Osler's nodes were observed on his fingers- signs indicative of endocarditis. No petechiae  Roth spots  or splenomegaly were present.  A subsequent echocardiogram showed moderate aortic stenosis with an added finding of a vegetation on the aortic valve suggestive of infective endocarditis. Blood cultures were taken and came back positive for Streptococcus viridans  further confirming the diagnosis.   Given his previous medical history  symptomatology  and the clinical and laboratory findings  Mr. Thomas was thus diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. Currently  his case has been discussed with the cardiothoracic surgery team and decisions regarding possible surgical intervention are being considered alongside a course of appropriate antibiotics.   Clinical course of Mr. Thomas’ infection  especially relation to his diabetes control will be closely monitored to provide him with the most suitable care plan. 
14,1,75,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial75,Presentation Title: A Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Overview:  Our patient  Mr. X  is a 63-year-old Caucasian male who has presented with sub-acute symptoms suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis. He lives in the city and is working as an accountant. His main complaint is persistent  low-grade fever for approximately 3 weeks  associated with malaise  reduced appetite  and weight loss of around 10 pounds during this period.   Demographics:  Age: 63 years Gender: Male Occupation: Accountant  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Residence: Urban Religion: Christian  Medical History:  Mr. X has a significant past medical history of moderate tobacco use  consuming a half-pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years  and alcohol use  about 2-3 drinks per weekend. This history corresponds to a high pulmonary risk that may contribute to the on-going problem.  He was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago  which is well-managed on Metformin. Due to this chronic condition  it puts him at an elevated risk for infections  including endocarditis.  Five years ago  he had undergone a mitral valve repair due to severe regurgitation possibly complicating chronic rheumatic heart disease. Ever since then  he has not faced any significant symptoms related to it.  His family history reveals that his father died of a heart attack at the age of 70  and his mother is alive and well at 88. He has one brother who has no significant health issues.  In summary:  Mr. X  a 63-year-old man  has presented with symptoms suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis. With his medical history of diabetes and heart disease  his symptoms are concerning and indicate a need for immediate attention and intervention. As such  he will undergo further evaluation  including blood cultures and echocardiography  to confirm the cause of symptoms and to plan the appropriate treatment strategy.
14,1,76,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial76,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Introduction:   We present the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian female recently diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.   Patient Demographics:  The patient  Mrs. W.  is a retired schoolteacher from rural Nebraska  Caucasian  and has an extensive history of untreated dental problems. She's a non-smoker and has no known history of substance abuse.   Medical History:  Her past medical history includes rheumatic fever at age 15  hypertension for the past 20 years  hyperlipidemia  and chronic atrial fibrillation for which she is on warfarin. She has a known allergy to penicillin  causing rash. She had a fractured femur 10 years ago  treated with intramedullary nailing and now non-weight bearing on the right side. Her family history is significant for cardiovascular disease and stroke.  Presenting Complaint:  Mrs. W presented to the clinic with complaints of fatigue  low-grade fever  chills  and shortness of breath on exertion for the past three weeks. The initial concerns were focused on possible respiratory infection or cardiac decompensation secondary to her atrial fibrillation.   On examination  she appeared pale and was found to have a cardiac murmur not previously documented. Dental examination revealed significant dental decay and gingival inflammation. Lab results revealed positive blood cultures for Streptococcus viridans  with mild anemia and elevated inflammatory markers.  Diagnosis:   Considering her clinical presentation  significant dental pathology  and isolation of a typical pathogen for endocarditis in blood cultures  she was diagnosed with native valve infective endocarditis.  Infective endocarditis  involving native valves  primarily occurs due to the spread of bacteria into the bloodstream (bacteremia) with the capacity to attach to heart lining  valves or blood vessels. In Mrs. W.'s case  her poor dental health probably facilitated bacteremia and subsequently the development of endocarditis.  She has been admitted for further management  which will likely involve lengthy antibiotic therapy and potentially valve repair or replacement surgery. The patient has been informed about the seriousness of her condition  and dental counselling requested for the improvement of her oral health.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of dental hygiene and care in the prevention of serious cardiac conditions such as endocarditis  especially among patients with existing heart diseases.
14,1,77,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial77,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile: - Name: Mr. John Doe - Age: 52 years old - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Office worker - Current Residence: New York City  NY  Background: Mr. John Doe is a 52-year-old Caucasian male with a previously known medical history of diabetes mellitus type II  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He is noted to have been a smoker for 30 years  consuming a packet a day but quit about four years ago. There is no known drug or alcohol abuse. He works as an office worker and lives in an apartment in New York City. His medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin.   Presenting symptoms:  The patient presents with a two-week history of intermittent fever  night sweats  and weight loss. He also mentions malaise  and shortness of breath that has worsened over the last few days. Recently  he began experiencing toothaches and had dental work done but did not take antibiotics.   Physical Examination: Upon examination  he appears generally unwell and fatigued. Cardiac auscultation reveals a new murmur consistent with possible valve damage. Further examination noted skin changes in the form of petechiae on his lower limbs  and on his palms and soles revealing Janeway lesions.   Based on the patient's medical history  and presenting symptoms as well as physical findings  a suspected diagnosis of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis has been made. Further investigations including blood cultures and an echocardiogram will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess the degree of valve damage.   If the diagnosis is confirmed  the patient will require prompt and proper treatment with intravenous antibiotics  and a referral to Infectious Disease and Cardiology for further decision on the need of surgical intervention. Strengthening oral health care and promoting health awareness are also critical in the management plan to prevent potential relapse and serious complications.
14,1,78,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial78,Title: Case Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Adult Male  Introduction:  Today  we will discuss the case of a 55-year-old Caucasian male patient  Mr. J  who presented with native-valve infective endocarditis. He is a resident of Brooklyn  New York  and works as a civil engineer.   Presenting Complaint:  The patient arrived at the hospital with a one-month history of persistent nightly fever  malaise  weight loss  and fatigue that gradually got worse. He also reported experiencing shortness of breath during mild exertion like walking a short flight of stairs.   Past Medical History:  Mr. J has a history of mild hypertension and high cholesterol  for which he has been taking Lisinopril and atorvastatin respectively. He is a former smoker and gave up smoking ten years ago. There is no known history of drug abuse. He has no surgical history. He has no known allergies.   Social History:  Mr. J. is married with two children. He leads an active lifestyle  including hiking and biking on weekends. He drinks alcohol in moderation  one or two glasses of wine  a few times a week. His family history includes heart disease on his mother's side.  Clinical Findings and Diagnosis: On examination  new-onset systolic murmur was detected. There were also signs of peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis such as Janeway lesions on palms and soles and Osler's nodes on fingers were observed. Laboratory findings showed elevated inflammatory markers and positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus. The diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was confirmed by Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) which showed vegetations on the mitral valve.  References: Mr. J's condition is a relatively commonplace presentation in the hospital. Infective endocarditis is an infection that affects the endocardial surface of the heart. The prognosis of this condition usually depends on early detection  appropriate therapy  and effective control of the infection.  In conclusion: Though Mr. J's lifestyle and medical history present minor risks for his current condition  this case underscores the necessity for a careful and holistic investigation when dealing with such non-specific symptoms as fever and fatigue  especially when combined with the new-onset of cardiac murmurs.
14,1,79,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial79,Title: Patient Presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction  Patient X is a 65-year-old Caucasian male presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Slide 2: Demographics  The patient is a retired manual worker  lives in a suburban area with his wife  and has a history of smoking 15 cigarettes a day for the past 30 years. He abstains from alcohol and has no known drug allergies. He has never had any occupational exposure to dust or harmful chemicals.  Slide 3: Medical History  Patient X was diagnosed with hypertension and type-2 diabetes mellitus ten years ago. Both conditions are managed with medication - Amlodipine 5mg per day for hypertension and Metformin 500mg twice a day for diabetes. Also  he experienced an episode of acute bronchitis six months ago but has since recovered.  Slide 4: Current Presentation   Over the course of the past two weeks  Patient X has reported having a high-grade intermittent fever  fatigue  a poor appetite accompanied by a weight loss of five kilograms and night sweats. An office-based test showed an elevated ESR and CRP  indicating an inflammatory process.  Slide 5: Clinical Examination  On examination  his blood pressure was 145/90 mm of Hg and the pulse was regular with a rate of 95 beats per minute. Auscultation of the heart revealed a new murmur in the mitral valve area. Ophthalmoscopic examination indicated the presence of Roth’s spots while Janeway lesions were noted on his palms and soles. His oral health being poor demonstrated a potential source for the bacteremia associated with infectious endocarditis.  Slide 6: Diagnosis  Given the clinical features  laboratory findings  and heart murmur heard on the mitral valve  Patient X is highly likely to have native-valve infective endocarditis. Confirmation of the diagnosis will require blood cultures and an echocardiogram.  Slide 7: Management & Conclusion  The patient will be started on empiric antibiotic therapy while confirmatory tests are conducted. Both his diabetes and hypertension will continue to be controlled with his regular medication. Patient X will be counseled on the importance of oral hygiene in preventing endocarditis.

He also mentions experiencing heart palpitations and discomfort in his chest area. More recently  he has been tormented by persistent coughing and breathlessness.  Past medical history: Mr. Williams has a known history of significant cardiovascular disease  including moderate aortic regurgitation diagnosed three years ago. He has mild hypertension  which is controlled on medication  without the need for hospitalization. Additionally  he has a ten-year history of well-controlled Type II Diabetes Mellitus. He had an episode of pneumonia five years ago needing hospitalization  but he reportedly has had no other instances of serious infections in the past. His medical record reflects consistent immunizations as scheduled  including the pneumococcal vaccine. There is no known history of illicit drug use.  Family History: His father passed away in his 70's due to myocardial infarction  and his mother is currently alive and well. He has two siblings  one of whom has hypertension.  Smoke/Alcohol/Drug Use: Mr. Williams is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally socially  and he denies any illicit or recreational drug use.   Lifestyle/Physical Activity: Mr. Williams enjoys an active lifestyle that includes regular physical activity such as morning walks and is an avid swimmer. He is also part of a book club and enjoys gardening.   In conclusion  Mr. Williams's symptoms of persistent fever  chills  sweating  and chest discomfort  in conjunction with his known history of cardiovascular disease  strongly suggest an infectious process likely localized in the heart. The clinical suspicion is high for native valve infective endocarditis  which needs to be investigated further with appropriate diagnostic testing. His medical history and risk factors warrant rapid initiation of management to prevent further complications  like heart failure  embolic events  or sepsis.
14,1,81,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial81,Presentation of Patient:  Patient Name: John Doe Age: 55 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting Complaint:  Mr Doe presents with symptoms that are indicative of native-valve infective endocarditis. These symptoms include persistent and unexplained fever  night sweats  fatigue  and loss of appetite. He also reports experiencing shortness of breath  especially during normal daily activities. Furthermore  Mr. Doe has visible  non-painful  red or purple spots (petechiae) on the skin and inside the mouth. On examination  a heart murmur can be detected.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a history of a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve  a condition which puts him at a higher risk for endocarditis. His congenital heart condition has been managed conservatively  with regular follow-ups for the past ten years. Besides this  he suffers from type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both of which are controlled with medication.  Family history:  Mr. Doe's family history is notable for cardiovascular diseases. His father died of a heart attack at the age of 60 and his mother has hypertension.  Lifestyle:  For the past 20 years  Mr. Doe has been a patient at our dental clinic  where he receives semi-annual check-ups and routine dental work. He is a non-smoker and a non-drinker. He leads a sedentary lifestyle and has a diet relatively high in sodium and carbohydrates  which likely plays a role in his present health conditions.  In summary  given Mr. Doe's congenital cardiac anomaly  persistent fevers  existence of petechiae  the presence of a heart murmur  and a lifestyle that might have led to such condition  his presenting symptoms appear to indicate native-valve infective endocarditis. Further examinations and tests are necessary for definitive diagnosis and treatment.
14,1,82,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial82,Patient Presentation:  Today we are discussing a 57-year-old African American male named Mr. Johnson presenting with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Mr. Johnson is a self-employed carpenter living in New York  a non-smoker who has records of moderate alcohol consumption. He has no reported allergies and his immunizations are up to date. His family history includes a father who had diabetes and a mother with hypertension.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) in his late twenties and has been managing the condition with periodic echocardiograms and prescribed medications. He had episodes of acute rheumatic fever in his adolescent. Apart from this  his medical history is fairly unremarkable  with no history of major surgeries or other long-term medical conditions.  Presenting Symptoms:   Mr. Johnson presented with three weeks history of fatigue  fever with night sweats  and about a six-pound unintended weight loss. He mentioned experiencing a loss of appetite accompanied by generalized malaise and a shortness of breath on exertion. He also reported enduring a mild  non-radiating pain in his chest.  Physical Examination:  On examination  Mr. Johnson was found to be febrile with a temperature of 38.7ºC (101.7ºF). A cardiac examination uncovered a murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation. There were Osler’s nodes present on his fingers and toes  and Janeway lesions were noted on palms and soles.   Given his past medical history and current symptoms  he was suspected to have native-valve infective endocarditis. His blood cultures were drawn and an echocardiogram was ordered.  These are the clinical data collected so far. Further investigations and management plan will be directed based on the results of the above tests.   Due to the presence of endocarditis  it has been necessary to recommend antibiotic therapy. Considering Mr. Johnson's health history  there will be a need for close monitoring and follow-up after his hospital stay to ensure that his condition remains stable and that no other health issues arise.
14,1,83,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial83,Patient Presentation:  This is a 60-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Johnson presenting with native-valve infective endocarditis. Mr. Johnson has a predominant urban dwelling and works as an accountant. He does not smoke but does consume alcohol socially. Mr. Johnson is a known hypertensive and diabetic  controlled on medication. He had an appendectomy at the age of 25 and a passing history of rheumatic fever in his childhood  but with no residual heart disease. He has no known drug allergies.  Around two weeks ago  Mr. Johnson started experiencing malaise  low-grade fever  chills  and marked weight loss. He also reported experiencing shortness of breath upon exertion and noticed occasional nocturnal sweating. He complained of new onset pain in his joints and muscles  mainly in his thighs and arms.  In the past week  his conditions worsened  experiencing excessive fatigue and worsening dyspnea. Due to these symptoms  Mr. Johnson sought medical attention.  Mr. Johnson has no family history of hereditary or acquired heart diseases. He is up-to-date with his vaccines and does not have any travel history in the past year.  On physical examination  he was found to be cachectic  mildly icteric with pallor. Conjunctival hemorrhages were observed. Cardiac auscultation discovered a new pansystolic murmur heard at the left sternal edge  suggestive of tricuspid regurgitation. Multiple petechiae and purpuric rashes were noted on his legs and foot  which might be Janeway lesions or Osler's nodes. Pulmonary auscultation was normal. His abdomen was soft  non-tender  with no organomegaly.  Given his constellation of symptoms and findings  Mr. Johnson was admitted to the hospital to get treated for possible infective endocarditis. Further testing  like blood cultures and an echocardiogram  are recommended to confirm the diagnosis. If the diagnosis of infective endocarditis is confirmed  it needs immediate treatment with specific antibiotics  and the patient will be followed for any complications.
14,1,84,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial84,Presentation of Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information:  The patient can be identified as Mrs. Amelia Martinez  a 70-year-old Hispanic female from San Antonio  Texas. Mrs. Martinez is a retired secondary school teacher  married with two adult children  and six grandchildren. She is an active member of her community and regularly attends church activities.   Medical History:  Our patient has had a previous medical history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  which she has been managing for 15 years  and Hypertension for a decade  which she manages through lifestyle modification and medication. She also has occasional episodes of osteoarthritis  which are managed with NSAIDs as needed. In her medical records  it is noted that she has had no past surgical procedures.   In the past  she has shown good compliance with her medication regimens  and her blood sugar levels and blood pressure have been well controlled. She has regular follow-up appointments every three months to monitor her conditions.  Presenting Scenario:  Mrs. Martinez has been feeling progressively unwell for about three weeks now. She complains of a moderate to high-grade continuous fever  malaise  loss of weight  and night sweats. She further reports shortness of breath  particularly during physical activities that she previously had no trouble with.   At home  Mrs. Martinez detected an irregular heartbeat and is experiencing symptoms of peripheral edema  thus she sought medical attention. There is no chest pain  and no history of drug abuse. Her immunization is up-to-date and does not have any known drug allergies.  Possible Diagnosis:  Based on the patient's symptoms  especially the continuous fever  weight loss  night sweats  an irregular heartbeat  and signs of heart failure  a suspected diagnosis is Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis. This suspicion will require further diagnostic procedures  including blood cultures and an echocardiogram  to confirm.   Mrs. Martinez's age  the presence of diabetes  and hypertension puts her at a higher risk for this condition. If the diagnosis is confirmed  appropriate treatment options need to be explored to provide the best possible care.
14,1,85,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial85,Patient Presentation  Today we are reviewing the case of Mr. James  a 60-year-old Caucasian male who has been recently diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. He is married with two adult children and lives in Austin  Texas. He works as a high school teacher and has recently retired.  Mr. James's past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension  for which he has been taking medication (lisinopril 20 mg daily) for the past five years. He is also a former smoker who quit twenty years ago after a 20-year history of a pack a day. He denies any history of alcohol or illicit drug use. There is also no known cardiac history  and he has never had rheumatic fever or immunosuppressive therapy. He also had a dental procedure done 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms.  Recently  he has been experiencing fever  chills  fatigue  and night sweats. He also complained of a new onset of lower back pain  weight loss  and reduced appetite. His family practitioner ordered a complete blood count test  the results of which showed an elevated white cell count suggestive of an infection.  As a result of his symptoms and clinical presentation  Mr. James was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. EKG was completed which showed normal sinus rhythm  transthoracic echocardiography showed vegetations on his native mitral and aortic valves  and a serious of blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus.  The combination of these clinical findings  his elevated WBC count in peripheral blood  and positive blood cultures were supportive of a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis  more likely related to his recent dental procedure. A subsequent treatment plan has been devised  and Mr. James is currently receiving an appropriate course of antibiotics.   This case is an example of infective endocarditis  which  although rare  can have potentially serious complications  especially when it involves native valves. Early recognition and prompt treatment are essential for a favorable outcome.
14,1,86,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial86,Presenting Patient: Ms. Jane Smith  Demographic Information:  Jane Smith is a 75-year-old Caucasian female  retired teacher  resident of Los Angeles  California. She is widowed  lives alone  and has three adult children who live in the nearby vicinity. She does not smoke or drink alcohol and has no known drug allergies.   Past Medical History:  Ms. Smith has a known history of type 2 diabetes which has been well managed through diet and Metformin for the past 10 years; she also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  controlled with Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively. She underwent a cholecystectomy 15 years ago. There is no known history of cardiac disorders  autoimmune diseases  or any other chronic conditions.   Presenting Complaint:  Ms. Smith presents with a two-week history of persistent fever  malaise  night sweats  and weight loss of about 5lbs. She also mentions mild chest discomfort  but no shortness of breath  cough or other respiratory symptoms.   Examination:   On examination  her temperature is 100.8°F  pulse is 90 beats/minute  respiration is 16 breaths/minute  and blood pressure is 128/85mmHg. She has no noticeable skin rashes or lesions but has noted mild pallor. Cardiovascular examination reveals a pansystolic murmur suggestive of valvular involvement. The rest of her physical examination is normal.  Preliminary Diagnosis: Considering her clinical symptoms and physical examination  a preliminary diagnosis of native-valve Infective Endocarditis is suspected. A blood culture and echocardiogram are ordered to confirm our suspicions and to assess the extent of the valvular involvement.   Plan: If the diagnosis is confirmed  we plan to start her on broad-spectrum antibiotics pending the results of the blood culture  followed by more specific therapy based on culture sensitivity results. She will need close monitoring in hospital  and we will consider the need for surgical intervention depending on the severity of her condition.  We also plan to involve a diabetes educator to review her diabetes management under this acute condition  and a dietitian to address her weight loss and to ensure appropriate nutritional intake.

Other Conditions:   - No history of Diabetes  Hepatitis  Renal issues  or Cancers.   - No known allergies.   - Complete vaccination status  including influenza and pneumococcus.     Recent Events: Mr. X underwent a dental procedure about a month back without any prophylactic antibiotics. Subsequently  he noticed the onset of fevers along with fatigue and general malaise  prompting a medical evaluation.  Family History: Both parents are deceased. Father had a history of Cardiovascular Disease  and mother had complications linked to Chronic Kidney Disease. Two siblings are alive and well  save for a sister recently diagnosed with Breast Cancer.  Conclusion: Given the patient's symptoms of persistent fever  weight loss  heart murmur  and recent dental procedure  along with a non-responsive state to broad-spectrum antibiotics  the clinical suspicion is leaning towards Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis. Further diagnostic procedures such as Blood Cultures  Echocardiogram  and other laboratory tests should be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis. Subsequent management will be based on the infecting organism and its antibiotic sensitivity  the patient's health condition  and valve lesion's severity.
14,1,90,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial90,Presentation Title: Infective Endocarditis in Native Valve  Patient Information:  - Name: John Doe - Age: 55 years - Gender: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: High School teacher - Location: New York  Medical History:   Mr. John Doe has a pronounced past medical history of congenital heart disease  specifically a bicuspid aortic valve documented since early adulthood. Other significant health conditions include type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  which are well-managed with medications. He underwent a gallbladder removal surgery 5 years ago but has not had any surgical intervention related to his heart condition.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Doe has been experiencing intermittent fevers  chills and night sweats for the last 3 weeks. Over the past week  he developed progressive shortness of breath and fatigue  which prompted his visit to the ER. The Family reports that he appears to have lost weight unintentionally over the last few weeks and he has also complained about moderate joint and muscle pain.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  he had a low-grade fever of 100.4°F and his heart rate was slightly elevated at 90 beats per minute. A heart murmur was appreciated  which was previously documented. Additionally  there were Janeway lesions (small  painless  red or purple spots on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet) and Osler's nodes (tender nodules on finger pads) consistent with infective endocarditis.  Investigations:  A series of tests were ordered  including complete blood count  renal function test  erythrocyte sedimentation rate & C-reactive protein. Blood cultures were taken due to suspicion of bacteremia. A transthoracic echocardiogram was ordered to visualize his heart valves and chambers  which showed vegetation on the bicuspid aortic valve  reinforcing the initial diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  Conclusion:  Mr. Doe is positively diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis  possibly secondary to unrecognized bacteremia  facilitated by his congenital bicuspid aortic valve condition. Appropriate treatment through long-course intravenous antibiotics is immediately initiated. His condition requires close monitoring to prevent severe complications such as heart failure  systemic embolism  and valvular insufficiency. Cardiac surgery consultation has been sought to discuss possible valve repair or replacement due to the severe damage to the native valve.
14,1,91,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial91,Title: Patient Presentation: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Information:   Mr. John Doe  a 48-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of fever  dizziness  malaise  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss. The patient lives in the metropolitan area and is a computer engineer by profession. His wife  who accompanied him  reported that he looks pale and fatigued.   Past Medical History:   Mr. Doe's medical history reveals that he is a type 2 diabetic. He's had the condition for six years but has managed to keep his blood glucose levels relatively stable through medication (metformin) and lifestyle modifications. The patient also battled an episode of acute bronchitis about two years ago but fully recovered following medical treatment.  Additionally  the patient has a known history of intravenous (IV) drug use during his late teens and twenties. He received treatment for drug addiction 15 years ago and has since maintained sobriety. He has no known allergies. The patient's family history is notable for cardiovascular disease.  Current Presentation:  Upon physical examination  the patient exhibits signs consistent with infective endocarditis  including Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes  Janeway lesions on his palms and soles  and petechiae on his conjunctiva and palate.  Initial laboratory results indicate an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-Reactive protein level  suggestive of systemic inflammation. His full blood count revealed anemia. Blood cultures were drawn and sent for further investigation. The echocardiogram showed vegetations on his native valves indicating native-valve infective endocarditis.   Given the patient's history and presentation  he is now being evaluated further and will be started on intravenous antibiotic therapy once the causative microorganism is identified.   Prognosis and further actions depend upon the response to antibiotic therapy  the extent of valve damage  any possible complications  and the adherence to prescribed therapies and follow-up appointments.
14,1,92,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial92,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information:  The patient  Mr. Alberto Ruiz  is a 60-year-old Hispanic male currently residing in San Diego  California. He is a retired lawyer with a history of tobacco use  having smoked a pack a day for the past 40 years.  Medical History:  Mr. Ruiz has a notable medical history that includes Type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and moderate to severe aortic stenosis  which has been medically managed for the past decade. He has no known drug allergies but does have a remote history of alcohol abuse  which ceased approximately 15 years ago. His surgical history only includes an appendectomy performed 30 years ago. He is currently on Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Aspirin for cardiovascular prevention.  Present Illness:  Mr. Ruiz presented with sporadic fever  chills  fatigue  shortness of breath and a recent unintentional weight loss. Over a period of several weeks  his condition did not improve and he was referred by his primary care physician to the cardiology department for further investigation. Clinical examination revealed a slight heart murmur previously correlated with his aortic stenosis. However  due to the progression of symptoms  it was suggested that his condition might have worsened or that he developed a possible complication  such as infective endocarditis.  Lab Results:  In the following blood tests  findings showed an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level indicating an ongoing inflammatory process or infection. Blood culture results were positive for Streptococcus viridans. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) exhibited vegetations on the aortic valve which coupled with his symptoms and lab findings  the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was confirmed.  Plan:  Given the identified infectious agent and its sensitivity  Mr. Ruiz was started on an appropriate course of antibiotics for infective endocarditis. He will also be regularly monitored for response to treatment and potential complications  both systematically and cardiac-wise. Upon improvement and clearance of bacteremia  the need for cardiac surgery will further be discussed taking his overall health and valve damage into consideration. He will also be emphasized about the importance of correct oral hygiene given the identified bacteria. As he's at increased risk for endocarditis  prophylactic antibiotic therapy prior to certain dental procedures will also be recommended.
14,1,93,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial93,Title: Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Patient  Slide 1:  Introduction  Today we will be discussing Mr. John Smith  a 65-year-old male with a history of degenerative valve disease who recently presented with symptoms indicative of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Slide 2:  Demographics  Mr. Smith is a retired engineer  socially active  married with two grown children. He is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. He hails from a suburban community with no recent travel history.   Slide 3:  Past Medical History  Mr. Smith has a history of degenerative valve disease and was diagnosed with mild aortic stenosis five years ago. For this condition  he has been on a regular check-up regimen  but no surgical intervention has been needed to date. He also has a history of controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Slide 4:  Symptoms and Physical Examination Findings  Mr. Smith presented with intermittent fever  fatigue  weight loss over the last six weeks  and a new cardiac murmur detected on physical examination. No skin lesions  Osler's nodes  or Janeway lesions were noted in the assessment. But a positive Roth's spot was detected during ophthalmic examination.  Slide 5:  Investigations and Diagnosis  Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans  an echo-cardiogram showed vegetations on the aortic valve consistent with infective endocarditis. His complete blood count revealed mild anemia and elevated inflammatory markers  and an EKG detected no electrical abnormalities.  Slide 6:  Discussion  Mr. Smith's presentation is indicative of native-valve infective endocarditis  likely resulting from his pre-existing degenerative valve disease. Without prompt and appropriate management  his prognosis may be poor due to complications like heart failure  systemic embolism  or uncontrolled infection.  Slide 7:  Conclusion  Native-valve infective endocarditis is a serious condition that requires an accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. Patients like Mr. Smith  with pre-existing valve diseases  are at a higher risk and need regular monitoring for any signs or symptoms of infection. His case emphasizes the importance of considering infective endocarditis in patients presenting with similar symptoms and a history of valvular heart disease.   Slide 8:  Future Steps  Mr. Smith will be initiated on appropriate antibiotic therapy and observed closely for signs of stability or deterioration. If his condition worsens or fails to improve with medical management  surgical consultation will be considered for possible valve replacement. The importance of his maintaining his follow-ups for aortic stenosis will be stressed to prevent similar future problems. 
14,1,94,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial94,Patient Profile:   Name: Mrs. Joan Starling  Age: 68 years old  Gender: Female  Race: Caucasian  Mrs. Joan Starling  a Caucasian lady of 68 years  presents today with a complaint of persistent fever  malaise  and symptoms of heart failure  including shortness of breath and fatigue. Mrs. Starling is a retired teacher and lives with her husband in the suburbs. She demises smoking  alcohol  or any illicit drug use but admits to having a sweet tooth and not being active physically.  Past Medical History:  The patient has been notably healthy with few significant medical issues. She has a known history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last ten years and managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. Furthermore  she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 5 years ago and is currently on a regimen of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and occasional corticosteroids as a treatment plan. She has no known allergies.  The assessment reveals she is notably tachycardic with a new heart murmur. Blood cultures and an echocardiogram have been ordered to confirm the diagnosis of native valve Infective Endocarditis. Her prolonged fever  symptoms of heart failure  and a newly noticed heart murmur all suggest the same.   Family History:  She mentioned her father passed away from a CVA (Stroke)  and her mother lived till the age of 89 without any significant illness. Her two sisters are alive and well.  Given her history of rheumatoid arthritis  which weakens the immune system and increased susceptibility to infections  and her history of diabetes  which can lead to a higher risk of infections due to high sugar levels being a good medium for bacterial growth; together  these conditions might have predisposed her to the development of native valve infective endocarditis.  According to the updated guidelines by the American Heart Association  her presentation fits the Duke’s criteria for probable infective endocarditis.  Thus  Mrs. Joan Starling is likely suffering from Native Valve Infective Endocarditis  and the isolation of a microorganism from her blood cultures will further strengthen the diagnosis. Immediate initiation of antibiotics therapy is planned. 
14,1,95,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial95,Subject: Patient Presentation: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  I would like to introduce Mr. John Willard  a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a recent diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Mr. Willard is from a suburban neighborhood in Austin  Texas  and has been working as an engineer for most of his career. He is a non-smoker and rarely drinks alcohol.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Willard has a history of significant medical conditions which includes type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he has been taking metformin for 10-years  and a history of Rheumatic fever in his adolescent years. He has been managing his diabetes well through medication and lifestyle adjustments  maintaining good HbA1c levels. He does not report any known allergies.  Current symptoms and diagnosis: Around three weeks ago  Mr. Willard started feeling unwell presenting symptoms such as fever  fatigue  weight loss  and nocturnal sweats  which he initially dismissed as possible flu. Over the span of a few days  he began to experience a new-onset of shortness of breath  mild chest discomfort  and palpitations  which compelled him to seek medical attention.  On examination  abdominal palpation revealed moderate hepatomegaly. The cardiovascular examination unveiled the presence of a new heart murmur suggestive of mitral regurgitation. Blood tests showed elevated inflammatory markers and three sets of blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus  leading to the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. The diagnosis was further supported by the echocardiographic evidence showing vegetations on the native mitral valve.  Conclusion: Mr. Willard is currently hospitalized and has started the right antibiotic therapy based on culture sensitivity. Given his risk factors and recent symptomatology  he is closely monitored by our multidisciplinary team including Cardiologists and Infectious Disease specialists. Early detection and intervention is crucial in managing Mr. Willard's condition to prevent serious complications like heart failure  embolic events or systemic sepsis. His next steps would involve managing his condition through long-term antibiotics followed by a possible evaluation for a surgical intervention  if necessary.    We continue to leverage Mr. Willard's motivation to improve his health  working together for a better prognosis and quality of life.
14,1,96,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial96,Title: Case Presentation of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Profile: Mr. Samuel Watson is a 58-year-old Caucasian male farmer from Albuquerque  New Mexico  with a history of Stage 3 Chronic Kidney disease secondary to uncontrolled hypertension. He presents with a 2-week history of health deterioration involving high-grade fever  fatigue  malaise and a 10-pound unintentional weight loss. No significant family history of cardiovascular diseases or rheumatic fever was reported. Ex-smoker  quit 10 years ago  and moderate alcohol drinker.   Chief Complaint: High-grade fever persistent for 14 days  associated with generalized weakness  fatigue  and malaise.  History of Present Illness: The onset of the disease was gradual  first manifesting as low-grade fever that escalated into regular high-grade fever spikes often exceeding 38.5 degrees Celsius. Symptoms were accompanied by consistent malaise  loss of strength  and rapid weight loss. He denies hemoptysis or dyspnea; no diarrhea or vomiting  and no rashes or joint pain.  Past Medical History: Mr. Watson was diagnosed with hypertension at age 42  poorly managed due to non-compliance until about 10 years ago when he started taking antihypertensive medications regularly. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with stage 3 chronic kidney disease 5 years ago. He had a minor kidney infection which was treated successfully 2 years back. No history of diabetes  heart disease  or any other significant medical conditions.  Medications Record: He is currently on Lisinopril 20mg daily and Amlodipine 10mg daily for his hypertension. He takes Calcitriol 0.25mcg daily and Epoetin Alfa injection weekly for his chronic kidney disease.  Social History: Mr. Watson worked as a farmer for more than thirty years and lives alone. He is a reformed smoker; smoked 1 pack per day for 20 years but quit 10 years ago. Drinks alcohol moderately  about 3-4 glasses of whiskey per week. No history of illicit drug use.  This overall clinical scenario raises a suspicion of infectious endocarditis in the context of unexplained fever  fatigue  and significant weight loss in a patient with chronic kidney disease and hypertension. Further investigations like Blood Culture and Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) are required to confirm the diagnosis.   Please note that other infectious diseases  malignancies  and autoimmune diseases should also be ruled out due to the patient's non-specific symptoms and unexplained weight loss.
14,1,97,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial97,Presentation of the Patient   I am presenting a 60-year-old Caucasian male patient with a native-valve infective endocarditis. Residing in Seattle  Washington  the patient works as a construction engineer and has a history of smoking  but quit approximately 3 years ago. He also has a moderate drinking history. However  he abstained from alcohol for the last 6 months. He has been relatively physically active throughout his life due to the demands of his job.   Past Medical History  The patient has a notable medical history of benign prostatic hyperplasia  for which he takes Tamsulosin. He also has a history of occasional atrial fibrillation  managed by Amiodarone  and suffers from hypertension - controlled with Lisinopril. Although he had never required any surgery  nor had he any known allergies  he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 5 years back and is currently on Metformin to manage his blood glucose levels.   Family history comprised of a father with ischemic heart disease who passed away in his late 70s and a mother who suffered from diabetes and died at the age of 82 due to renal complications. Both his older siblings are alive and well with his elder sister diagnosed with hypertension and his elder brother recently diagnosed with colon cancer.   Current Presentation   He presented to the hospital with a 2-3 weeks history of fatigue  lesional skin erythema  low-grade fever  night sweats  and weight loss. Upon examination  the patient appeared chronically ill. He had a new systolic murmur over the aortic area which is suggestive of aortic regurgitation. Additionally  Osler's nodes were also found on his hands and feet. These findings along with subjective symptoms are indicative of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Further diagnostic steps will include ordering blood cultures  an ECG  a chest X-ray  and a transesophageal echocardiogram. Empirical antibiotics will be initiated until the causative organism is identified from the blood cultures. A cardiology and infectious disease consult will be required as well  considering the severity and complexity of the illness.
14,1,98,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial98,Presentation:  Ladies and gentlemen of the medical team  I would like you to meet our 63-year-old gentleman  Mr. Smith. He is a retired factory worker and he resides at the suburban area of Philadelphia  Pennsylvania. Mr. Smith is of Caucasian ethnicity and he lives with his wife and a pet dog. He has a history of smoking for over 20 years but quit about 10 years ago; he consumes alcohol occasionally and does not engage in any illicit drug use.  Mr. Smith’s past medical history is significant for Type II diabetes for which he is on Metformin  and hypertension managed with Losartan. He had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) two years ago but fortunately did not have any residual deficits. An echocardiogram done after the TIA revealed mild mitral valve regurgitation  but he was asymptomatic at that time. There is no known history of allergies.  Recently  Mr. Smith was admitted following a week of moderate to high-grade fever  malaise  new-onset heart murmurs and petechiae on extremities. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated ESR  CRP and positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus. A subsequent echocardiogram showed evidence of vegetation on the mitral valve  thus leading us to a diagnosis of Native-valve Endocarditis.  Upon enquiry  Mr. Smith remembered having a dental extraction about 2-3 weeks ago and he did not take any antibiotics prophylaxis prior to the procedure. This is likely to be the underlying cause of his condition  as it placed him at a risk for bacteremia and seeding of the bacteria onto the cardiac valves  leading to endocarditis.  Mr. Smith's case is a good reminder of the importance of prophylactic antibiotic usage prior to certain procedures  particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions. Going forward  he will be started on an appropriate regimen of antibiotics  and may require surgical intervention if there is no improvement with medical treatment or if there are complications such as heart failure  uncontrolled infection or embolic events.
14,1,99,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial99,Mr. Johnson is a 58-year-old Caucasian male who has presented with a 2-week history of intermittent fever  fatigue  and a new onset heart murmur. He works as a farmer and lives a relatively healthy lifestyle  consuming a balanced diet and engaging in regular physical exercise. There are no reported recreational drug use  history of intravenous drug use  or recent dental procedures. He is married and has two adult children. He neither smokes cigarettes nor drinks alcohol.  Looking into his past medical history  we see that Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years ago and is successfully managing it with Metformin and changes in his diet and exercise routine. He also suffered a myocardial infarction (MI) 5 years ago for which he took dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin and Clopidogrel) along with Statin. He stopped his antiplatelet treatment 4 years ago.  His diabetes is well controlled  and he has not experienced any diabetic complications such as neuropathy  retinopathy  or nephropathy. His cholesterol profile has been within normal limits after the myocardial infarction and he leads an active life.   In the family history  his father had coronary artery disease and his mother had hypertension; both deceased. His older brother has a history of gout. There are no known genetic disorders or any other disease running in the family.   Given his recent constitutional symptoms  the presence of fever  heart murmur and his high-risk occupation as a farmer  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) is suspected. This will be confirmed with blood cultures  and if positive  he will need a transesophageal echo for further analysis and complete assessment of the situation. A treatment plan based on the results of these investigations will be put in place that may include antibiotics as per the isolated organism from the blood culture and sensitivity test. The prognosis of native valve IE will depend on timely and accurate diagnosis and strict adherence to the recommended treatment regimen.
14,1,100,diagnosis14-prompt1-trial100,Title: Case Report: A Presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  I will be presenting a case of a male patient  Mr. Abram Thompson  aged 65  diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis (IE). Mr. Thompson hails from a suburban community in Louisville  Kentucky. He is a former marine engineer and retired five years ago. His ethnicity is Caucasian and majorly practices a sedentary lifestyle.  Mr. Thompson has a significant previous medical history which influences his current condition. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild hypertension approximately ten years ago. His compliance with medications for these conditions has been inconsistent. He was a smoker for about 40 years  averaging 20 cigarettes per day  but quit five years ago on physician's advice. He is not a chronic alcohol drinker but enjoys the occasional glass of whiskey. He also has a history of dental cavities and had three teeth extracted approximately three months ago due to severe dental caries.  About three weeks back  Mr. Thompson started to feel unwell. His symptoms began as nonspecific low-grade fever  fatigue  loss of appetite  and weight loss. He also reported nights of excessive sweating and chills. Over the past few days  he developed new murmur and shortness of breath. On physical examination  splenomegaly was noticed and Osler's nodes were palpable on examination of his fingers and toes.  Based on his medical history  there is a high suspicion of infective endocarditis. He has risk factors such as a history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and previous dental procedures  potentially contributing to his current condition. His sedentary lifestyle could have also predisposed him to these conditions. To confirm the diagnosis and delineate the right treatment plan  further diagnostic tests including blood culture and echocardiography have been planned.  Prognosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is generally fair with the right treatment but can be complicated given Mr. Thompson's age and his clinical history of poor health condition compliance. Compliance to medications and lifestyle modifications will be key to his treatment success.   In conclusion  this case highlights the importance of managing underlying medical conditions and lifestyle factors contributing to the development of infective endocarditis. Furthermore  this also underscores the need for prompt recognition and timely intervention in such cases.
14,2,1,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial1,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Jones is a 67-year-old Caucasian male presenting with a 3-week history of ongoing fever  malaise  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss. His symptoms appear to have progressively worsened over this period  despite a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed by his primary care physician.  Past Medical History:   Significant for a history of intravenous drug use in his twenties  which he has since discontinued. However  he has been diagnosed with Hepatitis C from his prior substance use. He also has a known history of mild aortic valve regurgitation  characterized by occasional dyspnea on exertion  noted on routine echocardiogram 4 years ago but has been stable with no significant progression.  Surgical History:   None noted  Family History:   Father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 59  mother has Type 2 diabetes.  Social History:   He is retired  lives with his wife  and quit smoking and drinking alcohol 10 years ago.  Review of Systems: All other systems were reviewed and negative.  Physical Examination:   Vital signs reveal a fever of 38.8C  heart rate is 102 bpm  blood pressure 130/80 mmHg  and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. On cardiac examination  a new grade 3/6 pansystolic murmur is heard at the left sternal edge. Spleen is palpable with tenderness. There are no Roth spots  Osler nodes  Janeway lesions  or splinter hemorrhages noted. Hepatitis C complications seem stable.  Upon initial impression  coupled with his symptoms  history of Hepatitis C from intravenous drug use  and known aortic valve regurgitation  infective endocarditis needs to be considered as a strong differential diagnosis. Referral for a transthoracic echocardiogram and blood cultures for further management and treatment plan will be necessary.
14,2,2,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial2,Demographics: Mr. John Doe  a 45-year-old Caucasian male  presented himself to the hospital. He is employed as a construction worker and has been socially active with a history of IV drug use but has been clean for the last six years. He is a smoker and drinks alcohol socially.

He's also been complaining of night sweats  generalized body aches  and intermittent episodes of shortness of breath on exertion.  Past Medical History: He has a history of mitral valve prolapse that was diagnosed 3 years ago but has not been actively managed. He also had a brief episode of pneumonia 5 years ago which was resolved with antibiotics. He has not had any other major health issues such as heart attacks  strokes  diabetes  or cancer. His vaccination status is up-to-date.  Drug History: He is not on any regular medication except for an occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for his chronic back pain. He denies any other medication or use of traditional medicines/herbs.  Family History: His mother suffered from rheumatic heart disease and his father passed away due to colon cancer. One of his brothers has hypertension but no other family members have cardiac problems.  Review of Systems: Upon review of systems  He reports no nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  urinary symptoms  rash  or recent travel. He also denies any chest pain  palpitations  syncope  altered sensorium  seizures  or focal neurological deficits. He admits to poor oral hygiene.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient appeared ill and had low-grade fever. The cardiovascular examination revealed a systolic murmur in the mitral area. Oral examination showed poor dental hygiene. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Based on the above information  a provisional diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made. Blood cultures  an echocardiogram  and other necessary investigations are scheduled to confirm the diagnosis.

Mr. Johnson's past medical history is significant for rheumatic fever as a child and a recent dental procedure. He has been on prescription medication for hypertension for the past 10 years. He has no known drug allergies. He is a non-smoker  drinks alcohol occasionally  and lives with his wife. His family history is non-contributory to his current condition.  On physical examination  you notice mild pallor  mild dehydration  and low grade fever. His vitals include a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg  heart rate of 85 beats/minute  respiratory rate of 17 breaths/minute  and oxygen saturation of 97% on the room air. Cardiac auscultation reveals the presence of a new systolic murmur. You also observe petechial rash on his extremities and Roth spots on fundus examination.  Laboratory tests were ordered and blood cultures indentified Staphylococcus aureus  giving a pivotal clue towards infective endocarditis. An echocardiogram was arranged  which confirmed vegetation on the mitral valve indicative of native-valve infective endocarditis. His condition appears more serious due to his long duration of fever and the presence of systemic involvement.
14,2,4,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial4,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old male presents to the clinic with complaints of persisting high-grade fever for the past three weeks  associated with chills and night sweats. The patient also mentions experiencing fatigue  appetite loss  and unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds over the same period. He denies any chest pain or shortness of breath but mentions noticing occasional blood in his urine. These symptoms were initially mild  and he attributed them to a common cold  but their persistence led him to seek medical attention.  Upon further questioning  the patient reveals a history of injection drug use  but he quit around ten years ago. He also mentions he was diagnosed with Hepatitis C from his drug usage era but has been in a stable condition with no significant flare-ups in the past few years. He does not have any history of heart disease  diabetes  or hypertension. He has never undergone any surgical procedures in his life  including dental procedures over the past several months.   On physical examination  the patient appears ill and is febrile. Cardiac auscultation reveals a new regurgitant murmur. He is tachycardic with a heart rate of 105 bpm  blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg  and respirations are 18 per minute. On skin examination  Janeway lesions and Osler’s nodes are noted. Rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.   Given the patient's history of intravenous drug use  presence of a new heart murmur  fever of unknown origin  and findings of vascular and immunologic phenomena  a suspicion for infective endocarditis is raised.   The above clinical scenario represents a complete demographic detail with relevant past medical history for a patient possibly suffering from native-valve infective endocarditis.

He mentions an associated weight loss of about 10 pounds during this period  which has been unintentional. He also complains of night sweats. Patient denies any cough  chest pain  or difficulty in breathing. Past medical history is positive for hepatitis C (he used intravenous drugs in the past but has been clean for several years)  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes.  Physical Examination:  The patient appears fatigued. Vitals show temperature of 38.8 degrees Celsius  blood pressure of 140/90  HR-96bpm  and RR-18/min. Cardiovascular exam shows a grade 2/6 systolic murmur which was not there  according to the patient  in his last physical check-up. The skin has multiple non-tender erythematous nodules which the patient identifies as new developments  mostly over his lower limbs. Oropharyngeal examination reveals some tiny  painless red spots on the palate. No jugular venous distention  clubbing  or peripheral edema is observed.  Assessment:   Given the history of IVD drug use  new murmur  multiple skin lesions and fever  the suspicion index is high for native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient needs to be admitted  blood cultures ordered  and empirical antibiotic therapy initiated till culture reports come in. Echocardiogram needs to be done for additional confirmation. It will also help in evaluating the extent of valve damage. Further management will be guided by specific clinical and laboratory findings.

The patient reported experiencing intermittent fever over the last three to four weeks accompanied with weight loss  fatigue  and night sweats. She also complained of dyspnea during minor physical exertions such as walking short distances  which was not present before the onset of fever. Similarly  she reported new-onset lower back pain which had started one-week prior.  Past Medical History: Ms. Patterson is a long-term smoker who was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) eight years ago. She is also hypertensive and has been on anti-hypertensive treatment for the past ten years. She is not diabetic  nor does she have a history of heart disease. However  she was diagnosed with a tooth infection three months ago and had undergone tooth extraction. There is no history of intravenous drug use  recent travels or contact with sick individuals. Ms. Patterson lives alone and is retired.  Given Ms. Patterson's signs  symptoms and recent dental work  the physician suspects infective endocarditis  a serious infection of the endocardial surface of the heart  with particular emphasis on her native heart valves. Further appropriate examinations and investigations are ordered to confirm the diagnosis.

14,2,16,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial16,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male  named John  presents to the clinic complaining of several weeks of intermittent fever  night sweats  weight loss about 8 pounds over the last month  weakness  and fatigue. He also mentioned about experiencing an unusual sensation in his left leg recently that feels like numbness and burning.  John has a past medical history significant for moderate rheumatoid arthritis for which he takes a daily dose of methotrexate  and mild aortic stenosis which was detected through a routine check-up two years ago but has been asymptomatic so far and hence not intervened. He has no history of intravenous drug use  implanted medical devices  or recent dental procedures. He is a non-smoker  drinks alcohol socially  and has an unremarkable family history. He has been married 40 years and neither he nor his wife report sexual promiscuity or intravenous drug use.  On physical examination  his temperature is 38.5 degree Celsius and has a new harsh systolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border. Conjunctival pallor is noted  there is no clubbing  but there are small  painless erythematous lesions on the pads of his fingers (Osler's nodes) and similar lesions present beneath his toenails (splinter hemorrhages). Though he appears slightly uncomfortable  he is alert and oriented.  Relevant investigations are being planned including blood culture and echocardiogram in suspicion for infective endocarditis. He is recommended to get admitted for further evaluation and management. Recognition of his risk factors (presence of aortic stenosis and immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid arthritis) and clinical signs has led to this important differential diagnosis. His prognosis would largely depend on prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic and possible surgical management.

14,2,22,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial22,Patient Presentation:   Mr. X is a 69-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the clinic with a two week history of low-grade fever  fatigue  night sweats and unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds.   The patient's past medical history is significant for mild hypertension  diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of smoking for 40 years  which he quit ten years ago. He also mentions having had a dental procedure conducted about a month ago. He denies any history of travel  recent hospitalizations  immunizations or drug abuse  including intravenous drugs. His family history is non-contributory.  On physical examination  he appears moderately ill  has a fever of 38.5°C  a pulse of 90 beats per minute  and blood pressure of 130/85 mm Hg. Cardiac auscultation reveals a new murmur in the mitral area consistent with mitral regurgitation. Fundoscopy reveals Roth spots and skin inspection notes Janeway lesions.  This presentation is suggestive for infective endocarditis  with likely involvement of the native valve. Conexion with the recent dental procedure  which might have resulted in bacteremia  should be considered but further diagnostic tests such as blood cultures and echocardiogram need to be performed.  Given his significant risk factors (age  male sex  diabetes  and a history of smoking)  he is at high risk of infective endocarditis. Further diagnostics and management will be necessary.
14,2,23,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial23,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Smith is a 63-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the emergency department with persistent fever  chills  malaise  and increasing shortness of breath over the last two weeks.

Cardiac examination found a pansystolic murmur at cardiac apex radiating to left axilla. Few petechiae were seen on the patient's upper body and lower legs. Other system examinations did not show any significant findings.  Investigations: Initial labs showed high white cell count  raised ESR  and CRP. Blood cultures were positive. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm. Chest x-ray was normal. Echocardiogram suggested vegetations on the mitral valve suggesting the diagnosis of native valve endocarditis.   The patient was started immediately on empirical antibiotic treatment in conjunction with a cardiology consult.
14,2,25,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial25,A 65-year-old Caucasian male  John  presents to the emergency department with complaints of persistent fever over the past two weeks  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss. He also mentions experiencing night sweats and a new onset of lower back pain. An avid smoker with a 40-pack year smoking history  John also reveals an undisclosed history of IV drug use about 30 years ago.  John was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago  which has been poorly controlled with oral hypoglycemics due to his irregular medication compliance. He also suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to his long-term tobacco use  and he is currently on inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators. There is also a significant history of dental problems  with his most recent visit to the dentist being over a year ago for treatment of an abscessed tooth.   John's family history is significant for myocardial infarctions in both his father and older brother in their 40s  and his mother has heart failure. Physical examination reveals an unkempt gentleman in apparent distress. Upon cardiovascular examination  a new murmur could be heard over the mitral area. Examination also reveals the presence of Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes and Janeway lesions on his palms and soles. Upon interviewing  the patient admits to not having been immunized against common preventable diseases.  The constellation of the new murmur  persistent fever  potential septicemia from untreated dental infection  and past IV drug use raises the suspicion for native-valve infective endocarditis.
14,2,26,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial26,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department complaining of three weeks of persistent  generalized fatigue and high-grade fevers accompanied by night sweats. The patient also reported having a new-onset  intermittent heart murmur that he had noticed himself. He also had unintentional weight loss of about 5kgs over the past month. He denied any chest pain  shortness of breath  cough  nausea  vomiting  abdominal pain  joint pains  or skin rashes.  On further enquiry  he mentioned a recent dental procedure that he had about 4 weeks ago for which he was not pre-medicated with antibiotics. He has a 10-year history of intravenous drug use but has been abstinent for the last five years. He also has a history of heavy cigarette smoking (approx. 1 pack/day for the past 25 years) but doesn't use alcohol.  His past medical history was significant for chronic hepatitis C infection  for which he completed treatment five years ago  and hypertension  which was well-controlled under medication. His family history was non-contributory.   On physical examination  he appeared ill  was febrile (temperature of 38.7°C)  with tachycardia (pulse rate of 110 beats per minute)  and had a diastolic murmur heard best at the mitral area. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable.  These symptoms are consistent with classic signs of infective endocarditis  likely caused by the recent dental procedure and previous IV drug use.
14,2,27,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial27,Patient Information:   A 60-year-old Caucasian male presents to the clinic complaining of a 2-week history of malaise and fatigue accompanied by intermittent low-grade fever  night sweats  shortness of breath  and a weight loss of approximately 6 pounds.  Medical History:  The patient has a known history of intravenous drug use 15 years ago but has been clean for the last ten years. He has been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes  which are managed with a diet and Metformin. There is a positive history of rheumatic fever during his childhood. He is a smoker with a 30-pack year history but denies alcohol or any other substance use. There is no known history of recent dental or surgical procedures.

14,2,39,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial39,Patient Presentation:  A 58-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of intermittent fever  fatigue  and night sweats persisting for the past 3 weeks. The patient also reported a significant loss of appetite accompanied by an unintended weight loss of approximately 5 pounds within this period.  History:  The patient had a prior history of Intravenous Drug Use (IVDU) and was last known to use drugs about 6 months ago. The patient was diagnosed with Hepatitis C five years ago secondary to IVDU  but was successfully treated with antiviral therapy about 2 years back. Other significant history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for which the patient was on inhaler therapy. The patient had no known allergies.  Clinical Features:  On examination  the patient seemed fatigued  diaphoretic  and in mild distress. He was febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F)  his heart rate was 96 beats/minute  blood pressure was 118/85 mm Hg  and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. Cardiac auscultation revealed a consistent heart rhythm but with a high-pitched blowing murmur heard at the mid-cardiac apex on inspiration. There were no signs of peripheral emboli such as Janeway lesions or Osler's nodes.  Initial Assessment:  Given the patient’s history and current presentation  the suspected diagnosis for this patient was native-valve infective endocarditis  possibly secondary to his background of IVDU. Staphylococcus aureus is the most likely pathogen. This required additional investigation including blood culture and an echocardiogram.
14,2,40,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial40,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Nicholson is a 60-year-old Caucasian male who presents to the clinic today complaining of a rapid onset fever  marked fatigue  night sweats  and weight loss over the past three weeks. Initially  he thought these symptoms were due to a viral infection or the common cold but became alarmed when they started to worsen.  He has a history of intravenous drug use in his early twenties  although he has remained clean over the past two decades. This is notable as it increases his risk profile for native-valve Endocarditis.   His clinical history also shows he has a moderate degree of non-rheumatic mitral regurgitation for which he has been undergoing periodic observation  but was not considered severe enough for any surgical intervention. He has been well-managed on an outpatient basis for his hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Neither condition has been complicated  but they are stable and well-managed by diet  exercise  and medication.  He denies any recent dental procedures  surgeries  or use of central venous lines. He denies any history of rheumatic heart disease or prosthetic valve placement. He does not engage in risky behaviors and consumes alcohol minimally.   This presentation  combined with his predisposing cardiac condition and history of IVDU  prompts consideration of infective endocarditis. A full clinical exam and further diagnostic investigations including blood cultures and echocardiography have been arranged to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.   His family history is noncontributory  as both parents are elderly and alive  with no known cardiac conditions. Mr. Nicholson lives with his wife and two grown children  and he retired last year as a high school teacher. He does not smoke and does not own any pets. He appears to adhere to his medication regimen and has had all suggested immunizations.

He has a medical history significant for rheumatic fever during his adolescence and is on long-term warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation. Additionally  he has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and is a chronic smoker. His family history was significant for cardiovascular disease with his father having had a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. The patient reported having had dental extraction approximately a month prior to developing these symptoms.  On examination  he appears acutely ill and diaphoretic. His pulse is 110 bpm  blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg and has a fever with temperature spiking at 38.4°C. Cardiac examination reveals a diastolic murmur  best heard at the left mid-sternal border. On skin examination  the patient has petechiae on his anterior shins and the back of his hands. He has splinter hemorrhages in his nails and Osler nodes (tender subcutaneous nodules) are present on his palms and soles.  Initial blood tests show elevated inflammatory markers (CRP  ESR)  leucocytosis and anemia. Blood cultures have been taken and are pending. An echocardiogram has been ordered to confirm the suspicion of infective endocarditis. Given the patient’s presentation  the presence of cardiac murmur  and recent dental extraction  a working diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is considered.
14,2,42,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial42,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 56 years  Gender: Male Ethnicity: Asian-American Occupation: Dentist  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Doe presents with a 2-week history of fever  malaise  night sweats  loss of appetite  weight loss  and a new murmur on auscultation. He also reports tooth damage from a recent minor accident a month ago  which was subsequently left untreated due to his fear of dental procedures.  Past Medical History: He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 7 years ago and consuming oral hypoglycemic agents since then. Furthermore  he reported minor ischemic stroke 6 months ago  for which he started taking aspirin.  Family History: His father died from a heart attack at the age of 58  and his mother from brain stroke at the age of 69. His younger sister has type 1 diabetes.

Examination: On physical examination  he appeared ill and had a fever of 100.8°F. Cardiovascular exam revealed a new grade 3/6 mid-systolic murmur at left lower sternal edge. Other systemic examination findings were unremarkable. Ophthalmic exam revealed few minor retinal hemorrhages. Dental review showed poor dental hygiene and an untreated fractured tooth.  Investigations: His blood tests showed raised inflammatory markers and streaks of streptococcus mutans were detected in blood cultures. Echocardiography visualized vegetations on the mitral valve in keeping with the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Impression: John Doe  a 56-year-old Asian-American male dentist  with a background of type 2 diabetes and cerebrovascular accident  presented with symptoms consistent with native-valve endocarditis  this was confirmed by echocardiography and blood cultures.
14,2,43,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial43,A 65-year-old Caucasian male presents with a two-week history of fatigue  intermittent fever  poor appetite and an unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds. He also mentions experiencing night sweats  and more recently  discomfort in his left leg.   The patient has a past medical history significant for bicuspid aortic valve disease diagnosed five years ago. He has never undergone any corrective surgery for the valve issue as he had been asymptomatic. He also has a 40-year history of smoking  which was quit a decade ago.  Other significant aspects of his history include type II diabetes mellitus  managed with diet and metformin  and hypertension  controlled with lisinopril. He denies any recent dental procedures  intravenous drug use  or risky sexual behaviors.   In recent lab work  he was found to have elevated ESR and CRP indicating inflammation. His CBC showed mild anemia and leukocytosis. A subsequent blood culture came back positive for Streptococcus viridans.   On examination  he demonstrates a diastolic murmur appreciated best at the right upper sternal border. Cardiovascular examination reveals an early diastolic decrescendo murmur consistent with aortic regurgitation. Several scattered petechiae are noted on his lower legs  along with some erythema and swelling to his left leg.   The presentation of persistent non-specific symptoms  positive blood culture  existing cardiac condition  echocardiographic features  and physical examination findings lead to a diagnosis of potential native-valve infective endocarditis.
14,2,44,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial44,Subjective:  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male farmer  Mr. Jenkins  who presents to the clinic complaining of a progressive onset of tiredness  intermittent chills  night sweats  and recent weight loss. During a routine check-up a few weeks ago  a low-grade fever was detected and he was also noted to have a new cardiac murmur which had not been documented before.  Mr. Jenkins has a history of chronic periodontal disease requiring multiple dental procedures  most recent one being two months ago. He does not report any history of intravenous drug use  recent travel  or contact with sick individuals. He raises a few animals on his farm but does not recall any insect bites  scratches  or injuries while doing farm work.   Objective:  Exam: 62-year-old appearing stated age  in no acute distress but looking fatigued. Vital signs: Heart rate 86 bpm  Blood pressure 128/74 mmHg  Respiratory rate 16/min  Temperature 99.5°F.   Cardiovascular examination reveals a new grade III regurgitant murmur  best heard over the mitral area. No peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis such as petechiae or Janeway lesions. Oral examination reveals poor dentition and some gum inflammation.  Assessment and Plan:  Considering his recent dental procedures  the new cardiac murmur  low-grade fever  and other systemic symptoms  Mr. Jenkins fits the clinical criteria for possible native-valve infective endocarditis. Consequently  computed tomography  blood cultures  and transthoracic echocardiography will be initially arranged to confirm the diagnosis.   If the diagnosis of infective endocarditis is confirmed  consultation with cardiology and infectious disease specialists will be sought. Inpatient hospitalization for treatment with intravenous antibiotics may be required  depending on the severity of the disease and the patient's response to the initial antibiotic therapy. 
14,2,45,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial45,Patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presenting with symptoms of high-grade fever  chills  fatigue  new-onset shortness of breath  persistent cough  and a notable weight loss over the past several weeks. The patient also mentions the development of petechiae in his lower extremities and conjunctivae. He has a known history of intravenous drug use and was diagnosed with Hepatitis C approximately ten years ago.   Previous medical history reveals mitral valve prolapse identified 15 years ago  but the patient could not recall when it was last assessed. The patient also has a past history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with an ACE inhibitor and statins respectively.   The patient lives alone and admits to his IV drug abuse. He denies recent hospitalizations or any foreign travel. Upon physical examination  several Janeway lesions are noticed on the palms and soles. Cardiac auscultation reveals a mid-systolic click followed by a late systolic murmur best heard at the mitral area  indicating his known mitral valve prolapse might have led to mitral regurgitation. His vital signs are as follows - Temperature: 38.5° Celsius  Blood Pressure: 130/80 mmHg  Pulse: 90 bpm  and Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths/minute.   Given the clinical presentation and significant past medical history  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is highly suspected. Investigations  including blood cultures and echocardiography  have been requested for further confirmation.

No osler nodes  janeway lesions or other peripheral signs of endocarditis were observed.   Given her history  clinical presentation  and physical examination  she is suspected to have native-valve infective endocarditis possibly secondary to her untreated dental caries and IV drug abuse. Blood cultures have been drawn  and she is admitted for empirical antibiotic therapy and further investigation. Cardiology consultation is recommended.
14,2,71,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial71,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Laura Johnson  a 63-year-old Caucasian woman  presented to the clinic with a chief complaint of persistent fever for the past two weeks  fatigue  loss of appetite  and unintentional weight loss. She also reports intermittent chest discomfort and shortness of breath.  She has a past medical history of severe rheumatic heart disease during her childhood and now has known mitral valve regurgitation. Furthermore  she has been suffering from type 2 diabetes  well controlled on metformin  for the past ten years. No known allergies. She is on prophylactic penicillin for her history of rheumatic heart disease.   She works as a librarian and lives alone. She doesn't smoke or drink alcohol. She also volunteers at a local animal shelter during her free time. Recently  she adopted a cat from the shelter  which bit her on her hand roughly 3 weeks ago  which initially healed well  but now complains of mild pain and discomfort around the bite site.  Upon examination  she appeared in discomfort  mildly confused  and pale. A heart exam revealed a pansystolic murmur associated with her known mitral regurgitation. There is no evidence of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.   Her vital signs on admission were: pulse 112/min  blood pressure 110/70 mmHg  respiratory rate 20/min  and temperature 38.5°C. Lab investigations revealed mild anemia  elevated inflammatory markers.  The synthesis of her symptoms  physical exam findings  past medical history  and lab results leads to the suspected diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis  potentially triggered by bacterial introduction after being bitten by her new pet cat. 
14,2,72,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial72,Patient Information: A 52-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of intravenous drug use and Hepatitis C.  Chief Complaint: The patient presents to the emergency department expressing complaints of fever  malaise  night sweats  weight loss  and occasional shortness of breath over the past 2 months. Additionally  he reports increased fatigue and weakness  especially while climbing stairs or doing any strenuous activity.  History of Present Illness: His symptoms initially appeared mild but have progressed steadily. He reports no recent dental work  surgeries  or invasive procedures. He denies any recent use of illegal drugs. However  he confesses to a history of intravenous drug use  up until a few years ago.   Past Medical History: A known case of chronic Hepatitis C infection. No known heart disease or any other chronic illnesses. Previous history of intravenous drug use but currently in recovery for several years.   Physical Examination: Fever of 38.5°C  Heart rate 90 bpm  Blood pressure 100/70 mmHg. Inspection revealed pallor and conjunctival pallor. Cardiovascular examination showed a new-onset diastolic murmur best heard at the left third intercostal space. Small  non-tender erythematous lesions were also noted on the palms and soles. No Osler’s nodes or Janeway lesions were found on physical examination.   Assessment: Given the patient’s history and the presence of a new heart murmur and classic cutaneous manifestations  the patient was highly suspicious for native-valve infective endocarditis  likely secondary to his past history of intravenous drug use and currently untreated Hepatitis C infection. Further investigations and management were planned as per hospital protocols for suspected infective endocarditis.      Plan: Immediate blood cultures were ordered. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was planned to visualize the heart valves and chambers. Depending upon the results of these tests  the patient might require further cardiology consultation and potentially  valvular surgery if significant damage has occurred. Concomitant management of the patient's Hepatitis C is also warranted.
14,2,73,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial73,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 52-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a 2-week history of high-grade  intermittent fever max 101°F  associated with chills and night sweats and a 7-10 pound unintentional weight loss over the same period. He also complains of generalized fatigue  malaise and intermittent  dull chest pain unrelated to exertion.   Past Medical History:   The patient has a known history of intravenous drug use and was diagnosed with Hepatitis C eight years ago. He quit smoking five years ago  consumes alcohol socially and reports occasional cocaine use. He suffered a Staphylococcus Aureus bacteremia five years ago. The patient has had no surgical interventions in the past. Regular screenings have consistently returned negative for HIV.  Exam:   On examination  his vitals reveal a fever of 101.2°F and a heart rate of 102 bpm. Cardiovascular examination reveals a new  grade III/VI diastolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. He has scattered petechiae on his upper extremities  palate  and conjunctivae. Small tender nodules are noted on the pads of several fingers. A few erythematous  non-blanching macules are noted on the palms and soles. Abdomen is soft  slightly tender in the right upper quadrant. Sclera is mildly icteric. No other significant clinical findings are noted.  The patient's history of intravenous drug use and recent  ongoing symptoms of fever  sweats  and weight loss  alongside physical findings of petechiae  tender nodules on fingers  and a new cardiac murmur  all fall in line with a likely diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis.
14,2,74,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial74,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  truck driver by profession  presenting with progressive fatigue  night sweats  unexplained weight loss  and shortness of breath on exertion that has been worsening over the past four weeks. He reports a low-grade fever for the past seven days but denies having any chest pain  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  or increased urinary frequency.   Past medical history is significant for chronic lower back pain  for which he often uses nonprescription pain meds. He denies any known history of diabetes  hypertension  or heart disease but admits that he had not seen a healthcare provider for over 10 years. He denies any recent surgeries or hospitalizations. His parents both died of heart disease in their 70s. He does not have a history of IV drug use but is a 30-pack-year smoker and admits daily beer consumption.  On physical examination  he appears pale and diaphoretic with vital signs showing a blood pressure of 128/85 mmHg  heart rate of 105 beats per minute (tachycardic)  respiratory rate of 18 breathes per minute  and a fever of 101.2 F. On cardiac examination  a new-onset heart murmur is identified. Small  painless red or purple spots (Janeway's lesions) were noted under the skin of palms and soles.   Given the history  physical exam findings  and high clinical suspicion  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is being considered. 
14,2,75,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial75,Patient Presentation:  A 54-year-old Caucasian male presented in the Emergency Department with 2-weeks history of intermittent high-grade fever  malaise  night sweats  and unintended weight loss. He also reported newly onset shortness of breath and vague chest discomfort  not related to physical activity. His wife revealed that the patient was becoming increasingly fatigued and noticed that his skin had turned pale. She also noticed that he developed small red spots on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet.  He has a past medical history of bicuspid aortic valve  diagnosed 10 years ago on routine health examination  but has been asymptomatic with no history of congestive heart failure or surgical intervention. He has also been managing type 2 diabetes for the past 7 years with Metformin and a controlled diet  with HbA1c values consistently less than 7%. Additionally  he has hypertension  controlled with Losartan.   The patient smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day for the last 30 years and occasionally consumes alcohol. He is a handyman by profession and has no history of any illicit drug use. His immunization is up-to-date  and he has no known drug allergies. His father died of a heart attack at age 66  and his mother has hypertension.  On physical examination  his pulse was 95 beats per minute  blood pressure was 145/90 mm Hg  temperature was 38.4 C  respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. He had a soft systolic ejection murmur audible at the upper right sternal border. His skin showed petechiae on the palms and soles. He had no signs of peripheral edema.   This intense  continuous clinical manifestation with a positive heart murmur indicated a suspicion of native valve infective endocarditis in this patient. The doctor instructed further diagnostic tests including blood cultures  ESR  CRP  and transthoracic echocardiography for the possible presence of vegetations on the heart valves.
14,2,76,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial76,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old Caucasian male presents to the clinic with complaints of a high-grade intermittent fever for the last two weeks. The fever was associated with a loss of appetite  extreme fatigue  and an unexplained weight loss of about 8 kilograms over the same period. He reports a sharp intermittent pain in his chest that radiates to the left shoulder. He also describes experiencing episodes of night sweats. Additionally  he has noticed the development of a few painless reddish spots on his palms and soles  along with a few petechiae on his lower extremities.  His past medical history is significant for rheumatic fever at the age of 12 that caused mild mitral valve stenosis. He has not had any surgeries before. He has no known allergies  he does not smoke  and his alcohol consumption is reported as moderate. His family history included a brother who suffered recurrent streptococcal throat infections.  On examination  he has a temperature of 38.5°C  pulse rate of 120 bpm  and BP readings of 130/85 mmHg. We observe pallor  petechiae  and small painless red lesions on hands and feet (Janeway lesions). Cardiac auscultation reveals a Murmur best heard at the apex (mitral area).  His presentation and history support a provisional diagnosis of possible infective endocarditis. The patient's history of rheumatic fever and evidence of mitral stenosis increases his risk. Further investigations including blood cultures and echocardiography are indicated to confirm the diagnosis. 
14,2,77,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial77,Patient Profile:  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Thompson who has been referred from a local clinic. He is a retired teacher and lives with his wife.   Chief complaint: He presents with a three-week history of unexplained fever  chills and malaise.  History of Present Illness:  Mr. Thompson reports experiencing progressive weakness and fatigue over the last three weeks accompanied by episodes of intense shivering that typically occur during the evenings or early mornings. He reports a fever that reaches about 101 – 102°F. He has also reported a loss of appetite over the time period with some weight loss. He has had no cough  sore throat  chest pain  palpitations  shortness of breath  abdominal pain  or joint pain.   Personal/Social History:  Mr. Thompson has never smoked  drinks alcohol occasionally in social settings  and does not use recreational drugs. He has no history of travelling recently. He does engage in gardening and he took a single tick off his dog last month.  Medical History:  He has a history of rheumatic fever during childhood. Mr. Thompson has been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus five years ago which is controlled through oral medications and diet. Additionally  he has hypertension controlled through medication.  Family History:  His father passed away from a myocardial infarction in his late 50s  and his mother has Type II Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension.  Current Medication:  He regularly takes amlodipine and metformin  however adherence can be variable.  Review of Systems: On general examination  Mr. Thompson is alert but looks fatigued. He has a temperature of 101.5°F  blood pressure of 140/84 mm Hg  a heart rate of 92 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with normal O2 saturation at room air.  Physical Exam:  Cardiovascular examination reveals a previously undiagnosed systolic murmur. He also has finger clubbing but no other peripheral signs of infective endocarditis such as Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions.   These symptoms along with his past medical history and new cardiac murmur increase the suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis. Further detailed examinations and laboratory tests are needed for a definitive diagnosis.
14,2,78,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial78,Patient Presentation:  A 60-year-old Caucasian male named John Smith presents to his primary care provider's office complaining of several weeks of unexplained fatigue  fever  night sweats  weight loss  and muscle aches. He reports that his symptoms have progressively gotten worse over the past month. He states he has a history of intravenous drug use but has been clean for five years. During his drug use period  he used to share needles and equipment. He has a past medical history of Hepatitis C related to his former drug use.  John is a construction worker but had to stop working due to his current health status. He indicates he is a smoker but denies consuming any alcohol or illicit drugs. He reports malaise  chills  and shortness of breath. His body temperature is 38.4°C. On physical exam  his heart sounds reveal a new murmur consistent with valvular heart disease.   John has episodes of involuntary weight loss and loss of appetite. No specific allergens were reported  and his current medications include ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for the treatment of Hepatitis C virus for the past 1 year. He denies any recent travels  contacts with sick individuals  or pets at home.   Given his history of IV drug use  his new-onset murmur  and recent symptoms  a diagnosis of infective endocarditis is suspected. An echocardiogram and blood cultures are ordered to further assess this possibility. 
14,2,79,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial79,Patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug use and hypertension  who presents with a 2-week history of fever  non-productive cough  and generalized fatigue. He reports a weight loss of about 10 pounds in this period. He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or orthopnea. He also reports poor dental health  stating he hasn't seen a dentist in over 5 years.  Physical exam reveals pallor  poor dentition with dental caries and gingival infection  a grade II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the apex  and multiple non-tender  small purpura in the palms. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Pulse is regular and BP is 150/90 mmHg. Edema is not present in any of his extremities and his pulses are intact. He is alert and oriented to time  place and person.  Patient lives alone and admits to recurrent multiple substance misuse  primarily heroin  for many years; he is not on methadone. His past history includes hypertension for last 10 years controlled with medication  hepatitis C diagnosis 5 years ago  and recurrent skin and soft tissue infections. Previous hospital admission was 3 years ago for treatment of septicemia related to a skin abscess.  He is currently on lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. Allergies include penicillin  causing rash. There is no known family history of heart disease. He smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily and consumes alcohol sporadically. His diet consists primarily of fast food. He does not exercise regularly.
14,2,80,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial80,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of intravenous drug use and rheumatic heart disease  presenting with complaints of an ongoing high-grade fever for the past 10 days. The fever is continuous  high grade ranging between 38.5-39.5 °C but is non-responsive to over the counter medicines. Mr. Smith also mentions experiencing malaise  night sweats  loss of appetite leading to weight loss  and shortness of breath on exertion. He denies any chest pain  abdominal pain  or history of recent travel or sick contacts.  On examination  he appears cachectic and is temperature is elevated (38.9 °C). He reveals Janeway lesions on his palms and soles  as well as painless  erythematous Osler nodes are identified on his fingers. Cardiovascular examination is significant for a new harsh  grade III/ VI systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. Oral examination shows poor dentition.  Previously  Smith lacked regular medical care and has had intermittent periods of homelessness. He also has a history of chronic back pain for which he used intravenously heroin. He has been previously treated for Hepatitis C infection.  Given his past medical history and recent complaints  the differential is broad. However his fever  new murmurs  along with other findings pointing to septicemia (malaise  night sweats  loss of appetite leading to weight loss) suggests a high possibility of infective endocarditis  which is being tested for confirmation.   Mr. Smith's rheumatic heart disease and past of IV drug use are relevant experiences that increase his risk for infective endocarditis. Rheumatic heart disease may have caused structural changes to his heart  potentially making it more susceptible to infection. Intravenous drug use is another major risk factor for infective endocarditis  as bacteria can enter the bloodstream through needle-based drug administration. His history of poor oral hygiene can also be a potential source for bacteremia. 
14,2,81,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial81,Patient Information: Mr. A. Johnson  a 72-year-old Caucasian male.  Chief Complaint: Fever  weakness & shortness of breath.  History of Present Illness: The patient reports having a persistent low-grade fever for the last 2 weeks  accompanied by in-growing fatigue and weakness. He also acknowledges recent instances of shortness of breath with minimal exertion.  Past Medical History: The patient has a documented history of severe periodontal disease and has undergone multiple invasive dental procedures. He also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both of which are managed with diet  exercise  and medication.  Family History: Nil significant.  Review of Systems: Denies chest pain but admits to weight loss over the past month. Reports experiencing night sweats and on further inquiry  also admits to observing blood in his sputum occasionally. He denies any changes in bowel or bladder habits.  Physical Examination: The patient's temperature is 38.5 degrees Celsius. Heart rate 110 beats per minute  blood pressure 135/85 mmHg  and respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular examination reveals a new regurgitant murmur on auscultation. Skin exam demonstrates splinter hemorrhages under the nails. Intraoral exam reveals severe periodontal disease.   Provisional Diagnosis: Based on the patient's symptoms  physical examination  and past medical history  a preliminary diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis is suspected.   Plan: The patient will undergo relevant diagnostic studies including blood cultures and Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) to confirm the diagnosis. Antibiotic therapy will be commenced based on culture result. A consultation with cardiothoracic surgery for a possible heart valve replacement will be considered depending on the results obtained.

She has also been experiencing occasional night sweats and a newly appeared mild skin rash. Upon further questioning  she reports a subtle change in behavior  akin to mild confusion off and on  attributed earlier to age-related memory loss.  Mrs. Clara has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension  and she's a non-smoker. Also  she has a past surgical history of a dental procedure undertaken two months ago. She is taking Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. There is no known drug allergy and no family history of cardiac issues.  She lives by herself and is in general  independent for daily activities. She denies illicit drug use or high-risk sexual activities. Immunization is up to date  and the patient does not travel internationally frequently.  On clinical examination  her BP is 130/80 mmHg; HR is 90 bpm; febrile  with temperature 38.5°C; RR is 20 breaths per minute; saturating 96% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals a new systolic murmur best heard at the upper right sternal border and Janeway lesions on her palms. Her neurological exam is slightly abnormal with mild confusion during the interview.  Given her symptoms  clinical findings  coupled with her recent dental procedure  there is a suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis  and further diagnostic evaluation is undertaken.
14,2,83,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial83,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian female  a retired school teacher  complaining of persistent fever peaking at 101.5°F  night sweats  fatigue  and a new murmur observed during a routine medical checkup. She has remote history of dental procedures about three months ago but denies the use of intravenous drugs or engaging in high-risk behaviors. Her medical history is notable for rheumatic heart disease and a mitral valve prolapse with moderate regurgitation  diagnosed 10 years back. She is currently under watchful waiting and receives no medications. She neither smokes nor drinks alcohol.  The patient is visibly fatigued and in mild discomfort. The physical examination reveals mild pallor  a diastolic murmur heard best at the apical area  and a few petechiae on the conjunctiva and the oral mucosa. There is no evidence of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis such as Osler nodes  Janeway lesions  or splinter hemorrhages under the nails.  Based on the presentation  though blood cultures are still pending  the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis secondary to her underlying mitral valve disorder  possibly following her recent dental procedure  is strongly considered.

He also reports intermittent fevers but could not quantify their severity. The symptoms started mildly but have progressively worsened. In the last week  he has started experiencing shortness of breath  especially when he tries to perform regular activities.  The patient has a past medical history significant for intravenous drug use (Heroin)  stopped two years ago. He is currently on methadone treatment. He had a septicemia episode four years ago associated with his drug use. The patient reports he has not had any surgery in the past and has not been recently hospitalized. He has a known allergy to penicillin  manifesting as a skin rash. He quit smoking one and a half years ago after being a smoker for 20 years  and he is not a known alcoholic.   On physical examination  he is febrile (38.5 C)  with a blood pressure of 125/70 mmHg  pulse 98/min  respiratory rate 20/min  and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Examination reveals pale skin  mild peripheral edema  and a noticeable cardiac murmur on auscultation. The patient also has Janeway lesions (erythematous  nontender macules on the palms and soles) suggestive of bacterial endocarditis. Laboratory studies reveal mild anemia  leukocytosis  and elevated inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein and ESR). ECG  chest X-ray  and transthoracic echocardiography are ordered.  Concerns include possible infective endocarditis  which should be confirmed with further tests  such as blood cultures and transesophageal echocardiography if required. Urgent cardiology consultation is advised given the severity of presentation and increased risk of complications due to the patient’s history of intravenous drug use. 
14,2,86,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial86,Patient Presentation  A 65-year-old Caucasian male patient comes into the clinic complaining of a persisting low-grade fever for the past three weeks  intermittent chills  night sweats  loss of appetite  and recent unexplained weight loss of approximately 5 kilograms.

Further diagnostic testing including transthoracic echocardiogram and multiple blood cultures over time are ordered to confirm the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.
14,2,87,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial87,Patient Presentation  Mr. Jack Stone  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department. He is a retired construction worker who lives alone. He has a 20 pack-year smoking history. He has a known history of intravenous drug use  but he has been abstinent for about 15 years now.  Mr. Stone complains of recurrent fever  night sweats  and fatigue for the past three weeks. He also noted unexplained weight loss and shortness of breath that has been persistent for the past week. There is no chest pain  nausea  vomiting  palpitations  cough  or sinus congestion. He also mentioned a new onset of lower back pain and intermittent headaches.  A review of his medical record showed well-controlled hypertension (on Lisinopril 10mg daily)  type 2 diabetes mellitus (on Metformin 500mg twice daily)  and a previous episode of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia treated successfully about 2 years ago with IV antibiotics.  On physical examination  Mr. Stone appeared pale and tired. Vital signs were notable for fever (100.9°F)  tachycardia (rate of 108 beats per minute)  and hypotension (BP 100/60 mmHg). Cardiac auscultation showed a new grade 3/6 late-peaking systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. Janeway's lesions were observed on his palms and soles which he hadn’t noticed before. Neurological examination showed a positive Kernig's sign suggestive of meningeal irritation.  Given Mr. Stone's clinical presentation and past medical history  there is a high suspicion for native valvular infective endocarditis with possible secondary septic embolization. Hematological tests  blood cultures  and a transthoracic echocardiography are planned to confirm the initial diagnosis.

14,2,94,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial94,Demographic Details: Patient: Mr. Austin Gender: Male Age: 69 Occupationally Retired Ethnicity: Caucasian  Past Medical History: Mr. Austin has a long-standing history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and dyslipidemia. He is an ex-smoker and quit 15 years ago. He shows evidence of stable coronary artery disease diagnosed 8 years ago and has a past history of mild congestive heart failure. He also has had chronic stage-3 kidney disease for the last 5 years. He has a history of dental extractions and routine dental procedures  but no record of prophylactic antibiotics use.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Austin was brought to the emergency department by his son with complaints of progressively worsening fatigue  dyspnoea on exertion  low-grade fever  chills  new onset confusion  and a loss of appetite for the last three weeks. His son reported that Austin's color appeared to be pale recently and he experienced periods of drowsiness and unresponsiveness  and his skin was cooler to the touch.  Clinical Examination: On examination  he was in a state of obvious discomfort  diaphoretic  and looked acutely ill. His vitals were unstable with BP - 90/60 mmHg  pulse - 102/min  Temp- 100.6 F  and altered mental status. On cardiovascular examination  he had a new systolic murmur best heard at the cardiac apex. He also had evidence of mild pedal pitting edema. Digital clubbing was seen and splinter hemorrhages were noticeable under his nails.  Probable Diagnosis: The clinical symptomatic presentation of Mr. Austin with signs of an infection and the new systolic murmur indicates a possible diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Further diagnostic tests  including blood cultures and transesophageal echocardiogram  should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis.
14,2,95,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial95,Patient Profile: A 60-year-old Caucasian male was admitted complaining of fever  chills  and increasing general malaise for the past month. Also reported severe night sweats and a noticeable weight loss of nearly 10 lbs in the past two weeks. He recently had a dental procedure (scaling and root planing) performed about 2 months ago.   Past Medical History:  The patient has past medical history of significant cardiac issues  including a diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse. Additionally  he has mild hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes  both of which are under control via medication. He is allergic to penicillin  causing a severe skin rash. He is a retired mechanic and an ex-smoker  having quit 15 years ago. He admits drinking alcohol sporadically.

Palpable purpura was also noted on the lower extremities. Laboratory results showed elevated WBC counts  increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus. Imaging reports suggested echogenic vegetation on mitral valve suggestive of endocarditis.   The symptomatic and laboratory findings coupled with the recent dental procedure suggest possible native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment and close monitoring of cardiac function.
14,2,96,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial96,Patient Profile:   - Age: 56-year-old  - Sex: Male  - Occupation: Construction worker  - Ethnicity: Hispanic   Chief Complaint: Fever and weakness for the past one week  Presenting Symptoms:   - The patient has been experiencing a persistent high-grade fever for the past 7 days  accompanied by generalized weakness.  - He reported shortness of breath  especially on exertion  persistent dry cough  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss.  - He also reported experiencing intermittent drenching night sweats. - He developed new-onset lower-back pain and a few red tender spots on the soles of his feet. - There is also a complaint of loss of appetite and a feeling of general run-down.  Relevant Past Medical History:   - He has a known case of Mitral Valve Prolosis (backflow of blood because the valve doesn’t close tightly). He was diagnosed 10 years ago during a routine medical examination.  - He also has a history of recurrent dental abscesses  for which he undergone multiple dental surgeries. His last surgery was 2 months ago for an infected tooth.   Social History:  - The patient is a chronic smoker with a history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years.  - He occasionally drinks alcohol  mostly during social gatherings.  - He denies any current or past use of intravenous drugs.  Physical Examination:  - High-grade fever (102 F) - An irregular heart rhythm was noted. - A cardiac examination revealed a mid-diastolic murmur best heard at the apex (Mitral Region). - Skin examination showed Osler's nodes.  Investigations:  Sample drawn for blood cultures. Echocardiography is planned to confirm the clinical suspicion.   Diagnosis Status: The presentation is suspicious for native-valve infective endocarditis  pending confirmatory tests.
14,2,97,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial97,Patient Presentation:  A 47-year-old woman presented to the outpatient clinic reporting a 4-week history of intermittent fevers  generalized body weakness  occasional night sweats  shortness of breath and a poor appetite. She also reported that she had lost approximately 5 kilograms in weight over the past month without trying. Her past medical history was significant for intravenous (IV) drug use  which she stated she stopped approximately 1 year ago.  She reported having a dental extraction procedure performed about 6 weeks prior and mentioned they did not administer antibiotics before the procedure.  Physical examination revealed oral thrush  a new systolic regurgitation murmur best heard at the mitral area  smaller purple-colored spots on her skin (Janeway lesions) and a single larger tender  raised  erythematous lesion on her left thumb.   She has chronic Hepatitis C from past IV drug use but denied any known cardiovascular conditions. She has been in methadone maintenance therapy for opioid use disorder for the past 12 months. Her last normal menstrual period was 3 weeks ago and she denied any possibility of being pregnant. Socially  she works as a librarian and resides alone but has supportive family in the same city. She is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol use.  The rest of the physical examination  including a neurologic examination  was normal. No congenital heart disease was found. Chest radiograph and EKG were normal. Repeat blood cultures were drawn and serologic tests were sent to the lab. The patient was admitted for suspected native-valve infective endocarditis probably secondary to her dental procedure in the context of past IV drug use.
14,2,98,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial98,Patient Presentation:  A 65-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with a 2-week history of intermittent fever  chills  night sweats  as well as increasing fatigue. The patient also reports experiencing a loss of appetite leading to unintentional weight loss over the last few weeks. He denies any recent travel  sick contacts  or any known infection.  Past medical history reveals poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of drug abuse in his 20s  though he has remained sober for the last 30 years. He is unaware of any heart disease in his past and has never had echocardiogram or any other heart evaluation.  Examination reveals pallor and scattered petechiae on his limbs. He is febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C with an irregular heart rate. Cardiac auscultation detects a new murmur. Initial blood tests show evidence of anemia  leukocytosis as well as elevated inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR. His blood cultures are currently pending.  Taken together  these findings would be suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient's history of drug abuse (although happened a long time back) along with the uncontrolled diabetes and the presence of new cardiac murmur increases the chances. However  diagnosis would be confirmed with the results of blood cultures  and echocardiogram would be used to further delineate the condition of the heart valves. 
14,2,99,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial99,Demographic Details: Patient's Name: John Doe Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired Lifestyle: Non-smoker  occasional drinker   Presenting Complaint:  Mr. John Doe presented to the ER with a three-week history of persistent  low-grade fever  malaise  and unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 lbs. He also expressed concerns over a new  unusual heart murmur he had noticed.  Past Medical History: He is a known patient of Type-II diabetes mellitus under control with medications. He had a previous diagnosis of Rheumatic fever when he was a teenager  with subsequent emergence of aortic stenosis in his adult life which was managed conservatively. He doesn't have any known allergies.  Physical Examination: On examination  he appeared acutely ill and lethargic. Cardiovascular examination detected a new diastolic murmur at the right second intercostal space. A low-grade fever was noted (38.2C). Skin appeared pale with mild jaundice. There were noticeable Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes  additionally small  erythematous  round spots (Janeway lesions) were apparent on palms and soles.  Investigations: He was admitted for further investigations including blood cultures  echocardiogram  Complete blood count (CBC)  Liver function tests  and kidney function tests.  Differential Diagnosis: Infective Endocarditis  Rheumatic fever  Subacute bacterial endocarditis  Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis.  This case presentation is suspicious for Infective Endocarditis given the patient's new-onset murmur and additional systemic symptoms such as fever  weight loss  and the presence of Osler’s nodes and Janeway lesions. The patient's history of Rheumatic fever and subsequent aortic stenosis increases his risk for infective endocarditis. 
14,2,100,diagnosis14-prompt2-trial100,Subjective:  A 64-year-old  Caucasian male tiler who smokes about half a pack of cigarettes per day  and drinks alcohol socially is admitted to the emergency department. The patient's chief complaint is intermittent  high-grade fevers for the past two weeks. Fevers are associated with chills  nights sweats  loss of appetite and fatigue. He also reports a recent  rapid weight loss of approximately 8 lbs within this duration. He has no known allergies. Patient has a significant past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension and aortic stenosis diagnosed 5 years ago. He is on medications including metformin  atenolol  and losartan.  Objective:  Upon examination  he appeared ill-looking. Current temperature was 38.5 degrees Celsius. Blood pressure is elevated at 160/90 mmHg. Heart rate was irregular and tachycardic at 106 beats/minute. His oral examination showed poor dentition.  Cardiovascular examination revealed an early diastolic decrescendo murmur heard best at the left third intercostal space in the parasternal area. Skin examination showed Osler’s nodes on palms and soles and Janeway lesions were observed.  Investigations:  Lab test results: White blood cell count  erythrocyte sedimentation rate  C-reactive protein were all elevated. Blood culture results showed growth of Streptococcus viridans. Echocardiography was performed and revealed vegetations on the aortic valve.  Assessment:  These findings  in context of the patient's chronic valve disease  suggest a diagnosis of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis.  Plan:  The plan is to start aggressive antibiotic therapy as guided by culture sensitivity. Cardiothoracic surgery consultation was also initiated for further management and a discussion on possible valve replacement. The patient should also attend follow-up appointments and regular screenings for cardiological vascular health. He should be counseled on the importance of dental hygiene  smoking cessation  and alcohol moderation  which can all contribute to the development of endocarditis and its complications.

14,3,11,diagnosis14-prompt3-trial11,Title: An Unusual Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction - Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE) is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. It is primarily an infection of the heart valves  but it may natively occur in other parts of the cardiac structure.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics - Patient X is a 60-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired engineer  non-smoker  and rarely consumes alcohol. He has no history of illicit drug use.       Slide 3: Presenting Complaints - Patient X came in with a two-week history of fatigue  low-grade fever  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss. No history of cough  skin infections  trauma  or recent dental work.   Slide 4: Past Medical History - Patient X has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  well controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has a history of Hypertension  controlled with routine medications. No previous records of dental or surgical procedures. No recent travel or exposure to infectious diseases.  Slide 5: Physical Examination - On inspection  the patient appeared fatigued. An examination showed slightly elevated temperatures and pallor. A cardiovascular exam revealed an early diastolic murmur. No findings of Janeway lesions  Osler's node  or Roth spots.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Findings - Blood tests presented elevated ESR and C-reactive protein. The patient had mild anemia  leucopenia  and elevated glucose levels. Furthermore  three blood culture sets revealed growth of Staphylococcus aureus. - An echocardiogram confirmed the presence of vegetation on the mitral valve  indicative of NVIE.  Slide 8: Treatment and Progress - Patient X was started on targeted antibiotic therapy based on the sensitivity profile of the cultured S.aureus. - Regular follow-ups and blood tests have been scheduled to monitor the patient's response to the treatment.  Slide 9: Conclusion - This case emphasizes the crucial role of early detection and treatment of NVIE  seeing as the patient doesn't have common risk factors like drug abuse  artificial heart valves  or recent invasive procedures. - Even when NVIE is not strongly suspected based on demographic/pre-existing conditions  physicians should consider it as a differential diagnosis when a patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic findings align with NVIE.

14,3,23,diagnosis14-prompt3-trial23,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Female Patient  Slide 1: Demographics Introducing the patient  Mrs. A  a 70-year-old African-American female  she lives in downtown with her husband. She has limited mobility due to Parkinson's disease and requires a caregiver. Despite her mobility issues  she tries to engage in a healthy lifestyle and activities  and occasionally attends the local church.  Slide 2: Past Medical History Mrs. A has a history of Parkinson's disease diagnosed 10 years back. She is also hypertensive and was diagnosed with that 15 years ago. There is a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the past two years. No history of tobacco  alcohol  or illicit drug use.   Slide 3: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis For the past week  Mrs. A has developed symptoms including low-grade fever  loss of appetite  and unintentional weight loss. Her blood cultures have identified Streptococcus bovis as the causing pathogen and are indicative of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE).  Slide 4: Additional Workup After diagnosis  a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed  picturing vegetations on the patient’s native mitral valve  confirming the presence of native-valve IE.  Slide 5: Associated Risk Factors In the context of Mrs. A's medical history  recurrent UTIs may have considerably predisposed her to bacteremia  a known predecessor of IE. Her age  the presence of degenerative valve disease as a result of aging  and possibly impaired immunity due to Parkinson's may have increased her susceptibility to this condition.  Slide 6: Management Approach Mrs A's condition calls for an integrated approach  involving targeted antibiotic therapy for S. bovis  potentially over a period of 4-6 weeks. To prevent further complications  her heart function will require close monitoring. She may also need help from a dietician to regain weight. Depending on her response and recovery rate  valve replacement surgery in the future may not be ruled out.  Slide 7: Prognosis and Conclusion Prognosis in IE cases depend upon a multitude of factors like patient's age  the virulence of the micro-organism involved  time of diagnosis and initiation of treatment  and the presence of complications. With timely intervention  Mrs. A's prognosis seems hopeful  though she may require long-term follow-up and care.

14,3,26,diagnosis14-prompt3-trial26,Title: Case Presentation on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction Our focus today is on the case of a patient with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis. Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis refers to an infection of the native heart valves by bacteria or fungi  causing structural damage.  Slide 2: Demographics  Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  John Doe  who resides in a suburban neighborhood. He is a retired engineer  nonsmoker  and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Doe has a history of moderate hypertension and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 5 years ago. He has no known allergies and no previous history of other heart diseases  surgeries  or valvular disease.  Slide 4: Presenting Complaint Mr. Doe presented with a 3-week history of low-grade fever accompanied by night sweats and unexplained weight loss. He also reported experiencing general malaise  fatigue  and back pain during this period.  Slide 5: Clinical Examination Findings Upon clinical assessment  an irregular pulse was recorded. Upon auscultation  a heart murmur was heard. His teeth were in poor condition  hinting at poor oral hygiene  a potential factor in endocarditis. No other abnormalities were noted during the physical examination.  Slide 6: Tests and Diagnosis Laboratory tests indicated an elevation in inflammatory markers and mild anemia. Blood cultures were positive for a strain of Streptococcus viridans  a common oral bacteria associated with endocarditis. Echocardiograms further confirmed the diagnosis revealing vegetations or growths on the native valve  a classic sign of infective endocarditis.  Slide 7: Management and Treatment Mr. Doe was hospitalized and started on a course of intravenous antibiotics based on sensitivity to the isolated Streptococcus strain. His response to treatment will be closely monitored along with cardiac function  and a cardiac surgeon has been consulted in case surgical intervention becomes necessary either due to uncontrolled infection or valve damage.

14,3,63,diagnosis14-prompt3-trial63,Title: A Case Study on Native-valve Infective Endocarditis  Slide 1: Introduction to the Patient The patient in focus is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. X  a retired teacher living alone  who presented with symptoms of fatigue  night sweats  low-grade fevers  and unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the past two months.   Slide 2: Past Medical History Mr. X has a past medical history significant for rheumatic fever in his youth  which resulted in mild mitral valve stenosis. He has also been treated for hypertension and type II diabetes  both managed with lifestyle changes and medication. He is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or drug use.  Slide 3: Recent Health Issues About two months prior to current presentation  Mr. X had dental work performed without taking any prophylactic antibiotics  which is relevant given his history of rheumatic fever and mitral valve stenosis.   Slide 4: Examination & Diagnosis Upon examination  Mr. X had a low-grade fever and a regurgitant murmur was auscultated at the apex of his heart. Lab tests showed mild anemia and a mildly elevated CRP level. An EKG exhibited nonspecific ST-T changes. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed vegetations on the mitral valve  compatible with a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Slide 5: Causative Agent Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  a common pathogen responsible for native-valve infective endocarditis  particularly after dental procedures.  Slide 6: Treatment Plan Mr. X was started on penicillin and gentamicin to cover for S. viridans. Since his symptoms did not improve significantly after two weeks of antibiotics  and after consultation with Cardiothoracic Surgery  he underwent a mitral valve replacement. The postoperative period was uncomplicated and Mr. X was doing well at his 1-month follow-up visit.  Slide 7: Conclusion and Learning Points This case highlights the importance of appropriate prophylactic antibiotics in patients with a history of rheumatic fever and valve disease prior to dental procedures. Early recognition of the symptoms and signs of infective endocarditis  paired with appropriate diagnostic work-up and prompt initiation of treatment  are key to improving patient outcomes.

14,3,68,diagnosis14-prompt3-trial68,Title: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Study  Introduction: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare but severe disease having an incidence of 3 to 10 cases per 100 000 person-years. Native-valve endocarditis refers to the infection of a natural  non-prosthetic heart valve. This presentation focuses on a specific case of a patient diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Slide 1: Patient Demographics Patient X is a 58-year-old Caucasian male  a construction worker by occupation  residing in a suburban region. He is married and has one child.   Slide 2: Past Medical History Patient X has a documented history of intravenous drug use. Specifically  he reports a 15-year history of using cocaine  although he has been in recovery for the last five years  attending regular Narcotics Anonymous meetings. He also has a history of hypertension  for which he takes Lisinopril. He does not have any history of heart disease but does have a family history of atherosclerosis. He leads a relatively active lifestyle due to his physically demanding occupation  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms The patient came in complaining of fatigue  intermittent fever  chills  and unintentional weight loss over a period of three weeks. Upon further questioning  he also complained of recent episodes of night sweats.   Slide 4: Physical Examination On examination  the patient appeared tired. Blood pressure was elevated at 150/90 mmHg  and he presented with a diastolic murmur on cardiac auscultation. A few petechiae were seen on the skin of his lower extremities.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings and Conclusions Blood cultures were ordered  which came back positive for S. aureus a known causative agent for native-valve endocarditis. The Echocardiogram unveiled a vegetation on the mitral valve  supporting the diagnosis.   Slide 6: Treatment & Prognosis Treatment involved a regime of intravenous antibiotics for six weeks. Valve surgery was considered due to the patient's drug resistant organism and septicemia  but deferred due to overall stability. Follow-ups for monitoring the state of the valve tissue and the overall cardiac functioning have been scheduled.  Slide 7: Learning Points This case underscores the importance of an earlier diagnosis of infective endocarditis  in individuals with a history of intravenous drug use. Despite the patient's lifestyle changes  the history put him at a higher risk for endocarditis which should have warranted a closer monitoring for potential cardiac issues in regular check-ups. It also highlights the necessity for a multidisciplinary approach in managing such intricate medical cases.  Finally  it underscores instituting good preventative practices especially among populations predisposed to developing such conditions.  End of Presentation.
14,3,69,diagnosis14-prompt3-trial69,Title: Case Presentation on Native-valve Infective Endocarditis (NIE)  Slide 1: Introduction In the forthcoming slides  a case study of a male patient diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis will be presented.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our subject is a 58-year-old Caucasian male  a non-smoker  with a history of moderate alcohol consumption and works as a carpenter.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms/Complaints The patient initially visited the clinic complaining of recurrent fever  malaise  and unexplained weight loss. He mentioned about experiencing intermittent  knife-like chest pains lasting for a couple of minutes.  Slide 4: Past Medical History The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 5 years ago and has been on oral hypoglycemic drugs. He had a history of dental extraction three months prior to onset of symptoms.  Slide 5: Physical Examination On examination  we observed features such as pallor  peripheral stigmata of endocarditis like Osler's nodes  and Janeway lesions. Cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Imaging Echocardiography revealed vegetations on the aortic valve  compatible with a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. The ejection fraction was 50%.  Slide 7: Laboratory Findings Blood cultures revealed the presence of Staphylococcus aureus  which is consistent with infective endocarditis.  Slide 8: Treatment The patient was admitted and initiated on a regimen of IV antibiotics  including vancomycin and gentamicin. We plan for 4 to 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy along with regular echocardiogram monitoring.  Slide 9: Complications and Prognosis Complications of NIE can be severe  as it can lead to heart failure or septicemia if not promptly and effectively treated. Early detection and appropriate management are vital for a good prognosis.  Slide 10: Conclusion Infective Endocarditis  though relatively rare  can have severe consequences if untreated or undiagnosed. Patients with risk factors such as diabetes or previous invasive dental procedures should be carefully monitored for symptoms. On time diagnosis and appropriate therapies are critical to mitigate dangerous complications. 
14,3,70,diagnosis14-prompt3-trial70,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Study   Slide 1: Introduction Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe infective disease associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. It often affects those with pre-existing cardiac conditions but can also occur in individuals with native  previously normal valves  leading to native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE).   Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient  Mr. Smith  is a 58-year-old Caucasian male. He's a retired construction worker  presently living alone  with no regular exposure to children or pets. He has a significant history of tobacco use with 40-pack years. He has not traveled abroad recently and denies any illicit drug usage.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. Smith has a hypertensive cardiovascular disease well controlled with medication. He has had an episode of myocardial infarct three years ago  with no subsequent events. He does not have any previously known valvular disease. He was diagnosed and treated for an early-stage prostate carcinoma five years ago. He's been in remission since then  and it's crucial to monitor his general health.  Slide 4: Recent Medical History  Patient presented with a three-week history of fatigue  low-grade fever  night sweats  and weight loss. He's treated initially for a urinary tract infection due to his urinary complaints without any improvement in his symptoms. These nonspecific signs can often lead to a delay in diagnosing NVIE in a patient without known valvular disease.  Slide 5: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis Diagnosis Following blood cultures which grew Streptococcus mitis  Trans-Thoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated a vegetation on the mitral valve suggestive of infective endocarditis.   Slide 6: Treatment and Outcome  The patient was started on IV Penicillin G and Gentamycin  as per guidelines for the Streptococcus genus. The patient's clinical condition improved following the start of therapy. Surgical consultation was sought  but the team decided to continue with conservative medical management considering the patient's improvement with therapy and lack of valvular dysfunction or heart failure.  Slide 7: Conclusion NVIE  though less common than in those with pre-existing cardiac conditions  can occur and becomes challenging to diagnose due to its nonspecific signs and symptoms. Early diagnosis and management are critical to reduce associated morbidity and mortality. This case also highlights the ongoing challenge and importance of deciding between conservative vs. surgical management in NVIE.  End of Presentation.

14,3,75,diagnosis14-prompt3-trial75,Title: A Case Study of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Female   Case Presentation:  Introduction: Today we present a complex case of a 56-year-old Caucasian woman with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis.   Demographics: The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian woman  unemployed  non-smoker  living in a small town in northern Vermont. She is a former dental assistant with no exposure to occupationally related hazards.  Past Medical History (PMH): The patient has a chronic history of poor dental health and recurrent dental infections along with high blood pressure which is controlled with medication. She reports that she experienced a vague episode of flu-like symptoms in the last two months. She has no prior episodes of rheumatic fever or intravenous drug usage. Patient does not have a history of heart diseases.  Chief Complaint: Patient has been experiencing symptoms such as fatigue  fever  night sweats  weight loss  and a reduced capacity for physical activities over the past six weeks. She also reported experiencing dyspnea on mild exertion.  Physical Examination (PE): On physical examination  the patient was found to have an irregular heart rhythm with an unexpected heart murmur. A cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur. Ophthalmologic examination showed Roth spots. Splinter haemorrhages were noted under the nails of both the hands.  Clinical Investigations: Lab results showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)  C-reactive protein (CRP)  and leukocytes indicating systemic inflammation and infection. The patient tested positive in the Duke criteria. Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) revealed vegetation on the tricuspid valve which confirmed the diagnosis of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis.  Discussion: The patient's chronic dental infections are potentially the source of the endocarditis bacteria with her heart valves being at high risk as a nidus for infection  specifically Streptococci  the chief cause of infective endocarditis in people with a history of recurrent dental infections.

14,3,96,diagnosis14-prompt3-trial96,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Review  Slide 1: Introduction Today we are going to discuss a case of native-valve infective endocarditis  a serious condition characterized by inflammation of the inner layer of the heart due to bacterial infection.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Patient details: 55-year-old Caucasian male. Profession: Plumber and a part-time farmer  increasing his risk due to potential exposure to certain bacteria in his environment. No reported history of illicit drug use  blood transfusions  or recent dental treatments.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient's past medical history reveals diagnosis of Type II Diabetes controlled with Metformin. Previously  he underwent treatment for Helicobacter Pylori infection roughly 5 years ago. Regular body mass index  no occurrence of hypertension  hyperlipidaemia and family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Slide 4: Symptoms & Physical Examination The patient reported a history of recurrent fevers  fatigue  weight loss  and night sweats over the last 3 months. On physical examination  the clinician observed Janeway lesions  Osler's nodes  and a new murmur suggestive of valvular regurgitation.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Tests & Results Blood cultures confirmed growth of Staphylococcus aureus. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed vegetations on the mitral valve  confirming the suspected diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Slide 6: Discussion Infective Endocarditis  particularly involving native valves  is often associated with diabetes  and this patient’s occupation as a plumber and a farmer may have increased his exposure to S. aureus. The presented symptoms and physical findings further suggested this diagnosis  which was confirmed by blood cultures and TTE.  Slide 7: Management and Outlook The patient was admitted and started on empiric antibiotic therapy. Given diabetic status and signs of severe mitral regurgitation  a consultation with cardiothoracic surgery for potential valve replacement was initiated.  Slide 8: Conclusion This case highlights the importance of considering a broad differential in patients with vague  nonspecific symptoms and paying close attention to any potential clues in a patient's medical or occupational history.

14,6,1,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial1,Patient Profile: - Name: Mr. Smith - Age: 58 years old - Gender: Male - Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Construction worker - Residence: Urban residence - Marital Status: Married with two adult children - Smoking History: Ex-smoker  quit 15 years ago - Alcohol Consumption: Moderate drinker - Physical Exercise: Rarely  Presenting Problem: Mr. Smith has been experiencing fluctuating fever over the last two weeks along with fatigue  malaise  and unexplained weight loss. Initially  he attributed these symptoms to work-related stress and overexertion. However  upon noticing blood in his urine and producing a persistent cough  he sought medical attention.  Past Medical History: - Mr. Smith has a 12-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with oral hypoglycemic drugs. - He has been hypertensive for the last 10 years  controlled with ACE inhibitors. - He was hospitalized 15 years ago for a coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) due to severe coronary artery disease. - He was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease five years ago and has refused to go through surgery  he is currently managed with medications and lifestyle changes.  Family History: - Father died of Heart Attack at the age of 60.  - Mother is still alive at 78 with a history of hypertension.  Past Surgical History:  - Had a laparoscopic appendectomy 25 years ago - Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery 15 years ago.  Social History: - Mr. Smith smoked for ten years but quit 15 years ago. - He consumes alcohol occasionally in moderate amounts. - Gets minimal exercise due to the nature of his work and fatigue. - He follows an unhealthy diet high in fats and sugars.  Current Medications: - Metformin 1000mg twice daily for type 2 diabetes - Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension - Aspirin 81mg daily as a blood thinner - Atorvastatin 40mg daily for cholesterol  The problem representation for Mr. Smith suggests that he is an older man with a chronic history of diabetes  hypertension  coronary and peripheral arterial disease  who presents with new-onset fluctuating fever  fatigue  malaise  and cough  which are indicative of possible native-valve infective endocarditis. This suspicion is heightened by his history of heart disease and surgery  poorly controlled diabetes  and hypertension  which are risk factors for bacterial endocarditis. His lifestyle and habits  including smoking history and unhealthy diet  are additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease or infection. It also indicates a need for adjustment of his diabetes and hypertension management. His urinary symptoms may suggest renal involvement due to endocarditis. Immediate investigation is needed to confirm the diagnosis and commence appropriate treatment.
14,6,2,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial2,Patient Profile:  - Name: Mr. John Doe - Age: 67 years - Sex: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired  - Marital status: Married - Children: Two  - Smoking status: Non-smoker - Alcohol consumption: Moderate  socially - Dietary habits: Typical western diet - Physical activity levels: Low due to recent lethargy  Presenting Issue:   Mr. Doe presents with new-onset symptoms of lethargy  fever  chills  night sweats  weight loss  and reduced appetite. A murmur noted in the mitral valve area since the last medical examination. Also complaining of occasional discomfort in his joints  particularly small joints of the hands and fingers.  Relevant Past Medical History:   - Rheumatic fever as a child - Known mitral valve regurgitation diagnosed 10 years ago on echocardiogram  under cardiology follow-up  - Episodes of irregular heartbeat (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) managed with beta-blockers - Mildly elevated blood pressure (hypertension) under control with medication - Diabetes type 2  non-insulin dependent  controlled through oral medications and diet - History of dental procedures with a recent tooth extraction 2 months ago - No history of illegal intravenous drug use  Medications:  - Metformin 500mg BD for diabetes - Ramipril 10mg daily for hypertension - Bisoprolol 5mg daily for atrial fibrillation  Allergies:  - No known drug allergies  Assessment:  The history of rheumatic fever along with the chronic valve disease (mitral regurgitation)  together with the current symptoms may suggest the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE). The symptoms of weight loss  fever  night sweats and new cardiac murmur are classic signs of infective endocarditis. This patient also has a fair number of risk factors such as advancing age  male sex  the presence of diabetes  and recent dental procedure. Additionally  paroxysmal atrial fibrillation might require anticoagulant use which could potentially aggravate any existing infection.   Next Steps:  Immediate hospital admission is warranted. Blood cultures should be taken and empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated while awaiting culture results. The piece of management would be a consultation with the infectious disease specialist and a cardiologist. A Trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) should be performed to visualize any vegetations on the heart valves  determine the severity of the valve disease  and to assess for any potential complications of IE  such as abscess formation. Dental consultation regarding appropriate prophylaxis for future dental procedures is also a consideration due to the apparent association of his recent IE symptoms after dental extraction. In-hospital management would be considered after a diagnosis is confirmed or highly suspected.

Medical History: - Type 2 diabetes mellitus under control with metformin - Hypertension managed with lisinopril and amlodipine - Osteoarthritis in both knees - Family history records indicate that his father had coronary artery disease and his mother had rheumatoid arthritis  Physical Examination: - Mild pallor  looks chronically ill - Multiple hematuria under nail beds - Mild splenomegaly upon palpation - Heart sounds reveal a new murmur  suggestive of aortic regurgitation  Laboratory and Imaging Findings: - Increase in ESR and CRP indicating inflammation - Blood cultures positive for Streptococcus viridans  - Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed vegetations on the aortic valve  Medication  Allergies and Immunization History: - No known drug or food allergies  - On Metformin 500 mg twice a day  Lisinopril 10 mg daily  Amlodipine 5 mg daily - Recently completed a course of Ciprofloxacin for a UTI - Immunizations up to date  Social History: - Had been a domesticated pet owner with regular interaction with a dog - Limited physical activity with a sedentary lifestyle - Quit smoking 10 years ago  has history of moderate alcohol use - Limited diet  minimal intake of fruits and vegetables  Problem Representation:  A 65-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  presenting with several weeks of fatigue  fever  appetite loss and weight loss exhibits physical findings of aortic regurgitation and splenomegaly. Relevant history includes a recent urinary infection which was treated with a course of antibiotics. Laboratory results indicate inflammation and blood cultures show Streptococcus viridans. An echocardiogram revealed aortic valve vegetations  consistent with a diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis.
14,6,6,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial6,Problem Representation:  A 58-year-old Caucasian woman presents with a three-week history of intermittent fevers  chills  malaise  and unintended weight loss. She reports experiencing a loss of appetite  resulting in a weight loss of approximately 5 kilograms over the past month. She denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  or cough. She denies recent travels  illicit drug use  or exposure to sick contacts. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension  managed with daily lisinopril  and a dental procedure three months ago. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol socially. She lives alone and is retired.  Physical examination revealed slight pallor  fever of 38.5 °C  heart rate of 95 beats per minute  and blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. There is evidence of conjunctival pallor and splinter hemorrhages under the nails. Cardiovascular examination is significant for a new onset pansystolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border.  The patient did not receive prophylactic antibiotics during her dental procedure  and a review of her dental records indicates that it involved manipulation of the gingival tissue. These findings raise suspicion for possible infective endocarditis.   Laboratory studies showed a raised total leukocyte count with predominant neutrophilia and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Blood cultures are underway. An immediate transesophageal echocardiogram is recommended to confirm signs of vegetations on heart valves  indicative of infective endocarditis.  This patient's demographic characterization  relevant past medical history  and clinical signs support a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis of native valve - likely secondary to a dental procedure. Adequate and timely treatment is necessary to avoid severe complications such as valve destruction  heart failure  and septic emboli.
14,6,7,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial7,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. Smith.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith came to the hospital with complaints of recurrent fever  night sweats and unexplained weight loss for the past month  all of which have gradually worsened over the last week.  Demographics: Mr. Smith is a retired construction worker. He is a non-smoker and does not abuse alcohol or consume illicit drugs. He is married with three adult children and lives in a suburban area.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus which is well controlled with oral medication. He also has a history of mitral valve prolapse detected during a routine physical examination 10 years ago.  Surgical History: Mr. Smith has had no past surgical interventions.  Family History: There is a family history of heart disease (father died of a myocardial infarction at age 74) and diabetes.  Relevant Physical Findings: During physical examination  his temperature was found to be 38.3 degrees Celsius. Heart examination revealed a new murmur suggestive of mitral regurgitation. He also had tender  erythematous nodules in his fingertips (Osler's nodes) and hemorrhagic retinal lesions (Roth's spots).  Problem List: Primary: 1. Suspected Infective Endocarditis   Secondary: 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  3. Mitral Valve Prolapse   Plan: The patient needs to undergo laboratory investigations including complete blood count  blood cultures and inflammatory markers. An echocardiogram is also required to confirm the diagnosis of infective endocarditis and assess the severity of mitral regurgitation. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be started after drawing blood cultures.
14,6,8,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial8,Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  a 54-year-old African-American man  presenting at the outpatient clinic.  Presenting Complaints: The patient complains of unexplained weight loss  intermittent fever  chills  shortness of breath  and a persistent cough over the past several months.  Medical History: Mr. Doe's medical history reveals high blood pressure  which has been relatively well controlled with medication  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents  diet and physical activity. He quit smoking 5 years ago after a 15-year history of one-pack-a-day. His family history includes a father who passed from myocardial infarction at age 62 and a mother who is currently living with hypertension and diabetes.  Recent History: In the last 6 months  he was hospitalized for pneumonia  from which he recovered after a course of antibiotics.  Social History: He lives alone in a lower income urban area and works as an office employee. Cites no drug use or alcohol abuse.  Preliminary Diagnosis: His symptoms suggest a possible case of native-valve infective endocarditis. Although rare  this condition can occur among non-intravenous drug users with a history of other heart-related health concerns. His recent pneumonia could have also contributed to endocarditis.  Imaging and Laboratory Tests: Further supporting evidence would come from specific laboratory tests  including complete blood count with differential count  blood cultures  C-reactive protein  erythrocyte sedimentation rate  and urinalysis. Transthoracic echocardiography can be used for imaging studies to confirm the presence of vegetation or abscess.  Next Steps: If the preliminary diagnosis is confirmed  the patient may require hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics  with careful monitoring for complications such as emboli  heart failure  or abscesses. In severe cases  surgery may be necessary to replace the infected heart valve.

This presentation  in conjunction with his past medical history  raises the suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis. Further investigations would be required to confirm this suspicion.
14,6,10,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial10,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old Caucasian female  Chief Complaint: Persistent fever  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss for 2 weeks  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant past medical history pertaining to conditions like type II diabetes mellitus (well controlled with metformin since past 10 years)  hypertension (on Amlodipine 5mg)  and hyperlipidaemia (managed with atorvastatin 20mg).   Social History: The patient is an active smoker (1 pack/day for over 30 years)  denies alcohol or illicit drug use. The patient recently got an oral dental procedure from a local dentist about 3 weeks ago. She lives with her husband and two dogs  recently retired from work as a school teacher.  Presenting Signs & Symptoms: In addition to fever and fatigue  the patient also reports occasional night sweats  mild joint and muscle aches  intermittent headaches  and a small painful red spot on her left arm. Red and painful spots in her mouth are also noticed.  Diagnostic Test Results: The Physical Exam reveals mild splenomegaly and a new murmur on heart auscultation. Under laboratory investigations  the patient's blood cultures came back positive. Echocardiography reveals vegetation on the native valve suggesting infective endocarditis.  Problem List: 1. Suspected Native Valve Infective Endocarditis 2. Chronic Type II Diabetes Mellitus 3. Hypertension 4. Hyperlipidemia  5. Active Tobacco Use 6. Recent Dental Procedure  7. Positive Blood Cultures   Active Issues: The current priority is to manage and treat the suspected endocarditis. She will likely need IV antibiotics and potentially surgical intervention. Her other chronic comorbidities like diabetes  hypertension and hyperlipidemia also need ongoing management. Her active smoking status is a modifiable risk factor contributing to her overall health status.   Additional Considerations: The recent dental procedure might be the source of the bacteria causing the endocarditis. A thorough review of her medications  diet  and blood glucose levels is necessary for managing her chronic conditions. A pulmonologist consultation for her active smoking status and a nutritional consultation for her unexplained weight loss are also recommended.

Presenting Problem: He presented to the clinic with symptoms of fatigue  unintentional weight loss  night sweats  and a low-grade fever persisting for the past 2 months. The patient also reported feeling short of breath during his daily walks  a symptom he did not experience earlier.  Past Medical History: He has a known history of hypertension which is controlled on amlodipine (5mg daily). He also had a diagnosis of dental caries a couple of months ago but did not seek treatment.  Possible Problem List based on Symptom Profile: 1. Infective Endocarditis (eating away at his heart valve  leading to potential heart failure). 2. Possible development of Heart Failure secondary to Infective Endocarditis. 3. Untreated dental caries - possible source of infection for possible infective endocarditis.  Our primary concern for this patient is the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis  likely from his untreated dental caries which may have been a source of entry for the bacteria into his bloodstream. His age  history of significant alcohol consumption  and history of smoking may place him at a higher risk. Symptoms such as fatigue  unintentional weight loss  night sweats  and low-grade fever are non-specific but can be associated with chronic infection such as infective endocarditis. The new onset shortness of breath could indicate progression to congestive heart failure  a complication of infective endocarditis. His past medical history of untreated dental caries and hypertension - a condition that could have caused wear and tear on the walls of his blood vessels  hence facilitating bacterial seeding to his native heart valves  further support our concerns.
14,6,26,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial26,Patient Profile: - Identity: John Smith  50 years old  African-American  heterosexual  employed as a construction worker - Residence: Urban settings  New York  United States - Lifestyle: Non-smoker  occasional alcohol intake (once per month)  no illicit drug use - Family history: Father succumbed to heart disease at the age of 72  mother is known hypertensive  Past Medical History: - Diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease at the age of 30  currently ameliorated  - History of dental procedures without prophylactic antibiotics  - Well controlled hypertension  diagnosed five years ago - Underwent appendectomy 25 years ago  Presenting Complaints:  - Fever persisting for two weeks  - Palpitations  - Shortness of breath - Fatigue and weakness  - Unexplained weight loss   Physical Examination: - Heart: Possible heart murmur - Oral Cavity: Dental caries noted - Skin: No noticeable petechiae or skin manifestation of endocarditis  - Extremities: No peripheral signs such as Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions   These symptoms along with the past medical history suggest an infective endocarditis context with native valve involvement. Further investigations should include blood cultures  inflammation markers  and an echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis and assess the damage to the cardiac structures. Urgent hospital admission is suggested given the probability of serious complications if the condition is not promptly treated.
14,6,27,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial27,Problem Representation:   A 58-year-old Caucasian male patient presents with a two-week history of intermittent fever  malaise  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss. He reports recent travels abroad  particularly visiting developing countries as a part of his missionary work with communities with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water.  His past medical history is significant for degenerative disc disease and rheumatoid arthritis  with chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but no record of immunosuppressive therapy. The patient has no known allergies to medications and has an average alcohol consumption. The patient is a non-smoker and maintains a generally healthy lifestyle.  Moreover  he denies any illicit drug use  any known past infections  or a family history of cardiac diseases. The patient is not diabetic and does not have a history of cardiovascular disease. He does not have any dental problems or recent dental procedures. His immunizations are up to date.  The patient lives in a suburban area with his wife and has no pets. His occupation is a desk job and does not involve exposure to industrial or environmental toxins.  The eminence of his missionary work  relevant past medical history  and current symptoms hint at the possibility of a serious systemic infection  specifically native-valve infective endocarditis  which requires further investigation.  The absence of known cardiac diseases  immunosuppressive therapy  and intravenous drug use deem the patient at low risk for infective endocarditis according to Duke's criteria. However  considering his recent travels and presenting symptoms  it becomes necessary to rule out this condition.  This representation intends to demonstrate a typical patient presentation for potential native-valve infective endocarditis without the general higher risk factors being evident. Further diagnostic measures  including blood cultures and echocardiography  may be required to confirm the diagnosis and begin appropriate treatment promptly.
14,6,28,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial28,Problem Representation:  Mr. Smith  a 50-year-old Caucasian male with a history of smoking and IV drug usage  currently working as an automotive mechanic is presented to the emergency department with a fever  malaise  new-onset heart murmur  and Osler's nodes  suggestive of a typical case of native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient has a relevant past medical history of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection  managed with antiviral therapy  and reformed IV drug abuse. No known drug allergies. He is currently on a maintenance therapy of methadone for past opioid dependency and receives a monthly buprenorphine-naloxone injection. He does not consume alcohol frequently and has a 15-pack-year smoking history but quit 5 years ago.  Mr. Smith lives in a rented apartment in the city  has limited contact with family members  which include his divorced wife and two teenage children with whom he has shared custody. He has a history of poor compliance with medical appointments due to his challenging work schedule and related socioeconomic factors.  The suspect for infection could be S. aureus or Streptococci considering his history with illicit drug use. His risk is increased due to his profession exposing him to the risk of skin lesions or abrasions  which might act as a possible route of infection. His current symptoms have been persisting for 5 days and have progressively worsened  with no relief from over-the-counter medications. Appropriate blood tests  including cultures  along with an echocardiogram are being considered to confirm infective endocarditis.  This brief characterizes the demographic profile and clinical history of the typical patient with native-valve infective endocarditis. This sketch may not cover all possibilities but provides a general population-based understanding for the condition. Any subsequent clinical decisions should be tailored to the individual patient’s clinical situation.
14,6,29,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial29,Patient Profile:  Name: Patient X Age: 55 Sex: Male Race: Hispanic Occupation: Teacher Marital status: Married Smoking: None Alcohol: Moderate Physical activity: Mild exercise 3 times/weekly  Problem Representation:  Chief Complaint: Recurring fever for the past two weeks  fatigue  shortness of breath and weight loss.  History of Present Illness:   Patient X started experiencing a moderate-grade fever  coming and going  about two weeks ago. Over time  he’s grown increasingly fatigued  which is unusual for him  as he’s normally fairly active. He has also noticed some shortness of breath and an unexpected weight loss. He hasn’t observed any visible deformities or skin-related changes.  Past Medical History:  Patient was diagnosed with Rheumatic fever in his childhood. He was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 about five years ago and has been managing it with diet and the oral hypoglycemic drug  Metformin. Patient has also been managed for hypertension with Lisinopril for the past two years. In his late 40s  Patient X experienced frequent dental infections for which he underwent tooth extraction and was on multiple courses of antibiotics.  Drug History:  He is on Metformin 500mg BID for diabetes and Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension.  Examination:  Vital signs show a mild fever  mild hypertension and elevated heart rate. Physical examination reveals significant findings including a heart murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation  Osler’s nodes on pads of fingers and toes  and Janeway lesions on palms and soles.  Diagnosis:  Based on presenting symptoms  past medical history  and physical examination  Patient X is most likely suffering from Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis.   The history of rheumatic heart disease in childhood  frequent dental procedures  diabetes  and hypertension are factors that increase his risk. This  along with his current symptoms such as fever  fatigue  weight loss  and the presence of Osler nodes and Janeway lesions  are strongly suggestive of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis. The murmur suggests that the infection is affecting the aortic valve.  Further Management:  After the problem representation  the clinician should advise blood cultures  Echocardiography (Transthoracic or Transesophageal) and other necessary laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis and identify the organism causing Infective Endocarditis. Following identification  antibiotic therapy should be initiated.
14,6,30,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial30,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old Caucasian male (non-smoker  occasional alcohol consumption) presenting with symptoms of fever  fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  and new-onset heart murmur.  Demographic Information: The patient lives in an urban area  works as a retired engineer  and has no known allergies or immunizations due. He lives with his wife and has a family history of cardiovascular disease - his father having died from a heart attack at age 70.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia controlled by medications (Losartan 50 mg  Atorvastatin 20mg). He has no known drug allergies. The patient suffered a transient ischaemic stroke with no residual deficits 5 years ago  for which he has been on aspirin (75mg) since. No history of intravenous drug use or blood transfusions. The patient's dental examination 1 month ago demonstrated evidence of chronic periodontitis.  Presenting Complaint: In the week leading up to admission  the patient had been experiencing a high-grade intermittent fever with rigors. Moreover  he started losing weight  despite having a good appetite. He felt increasingly short of breath and had a bout of syncope. On physical examination  he had a new onset of cardiac murmur and splinter hemorrhages under his nails.   Summary: This patient has many risk factors for developing native valve endocarditis. His age  male gender  family history of heart disease  presence of chronic conditions like hypertension and hyperlipidemia  history of stroke  and the chronic periodontitis all put him at a higher risk of getting this infection. The symptoms he is presenting with-fever  weight loss  night sweats  and heart murmur-further corroborate this possibility.

Problem Representation:  A 58-year-old male with a history of rheumatic fever resulting in damaged heart valves presents with persistent fever unresponsive to over-the-counter fever reducers  fatigue  chills  and night sweats for a week. His physical examination shows a heart murmur indicative of potential valve complications and blood culture tests reveal the presence of Streptococcus viridans. The echocardiogram shows vegetation on the mitral valve. All of his symptoms and findings suggest a possible case of native valve infective endocarditis.
14,6,35,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial35,Patient Profile:  Gender: Male Age: 58 Race: Caucasian Occupation: Construction worker  Presenting Complaint: The patient is presenting with symptoms of unexplained fever  night sweats  weight loss  and fatigue. Also  he reported experiencing shortness of breath and occasional chest pain  which he assumed to be due to his relatively physically demanding job.  Past Medical History:  1. History of severe dental caries and recent dental surgery (three weeks prior to symptom onset). 2. Past history of intravenous drug use in his early 20s  but claims to have been clean for the past 30 years. 3. History of rheumatic heart disease. 4. He had an apparent episode of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia post his dental surgery but was lost to follow up. 5. Suffered from occasional bouts of pneumonia throughout his life. 6. Has had a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) eight years ago and underwent successful primary angioplasty.  Lifestyle: Ex-smoker. Has been consuming alcohol socially. He states his diet is reasonably healthy  but his lifestyle involves minimal physical activity.   Family history: His father died of a heart attack at the age of 60.  His current presentation along with his past untreated bacteremia and medical history of rheumatic heart disease  recent dental surgery makes him a potential candidate for native-valve infective endocarditis. However  further diagnostic tests including blood cultures and echocardiography are needed to confirm the clinical suspicion. His previous history of intravenous drug use further adds to his risk profile of developing infective endocarditis.
14,6,36,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial36,Patient Profile:   a. Demographic Information: Name: Mr. X Age: 55 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Construction worker Marital Status: Married Residential Status: Urban setting  b. Relevant Past Medical History: Mr. X is a known case of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension which have been under relatively good control with oral medication. He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery 3 years ago due to ischemic heart disease. He is a former smoker and has a 20 pack-year smoking history but stopped smoking since the surgery. There is no known history of illicit drug use.   c. Presenting Complaint:  He is presenting with constant  low-grade fever for the past 3 weeks  malaise  weight loss  and occasional chest pain. He also reported experiencing shortness of breath on exertion  and night sweats.   d. Representation of Problem:  Given Mr. X's presentation and past medical history  the main concern is native-valve infective endocarditis  given his background of ischemic heart disease and risk factors such as diabetes and past cardiac surgery. These chronic conditions can impair immune system functionality and heart valves  increasing the vulnerability to infection. His symptoms of chronic low-grade fever  malaise  fatigue  and chest pain are consistent with the typical clinical presentation of endocarditis. Therefore  immediate diagnostic evaluation with blood cultures and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be considered. Emphasis also should be given to the patient's blood glucose control  lifestyle modifications  and regular follow-ups to ensure overall health maintenance.
14,6,37,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial37,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old Caucasian male with a history of IV drug use and Hepatitis C.

He has a low income and poor access to regular medical care and medications.   Family History:  His mother died of a stroke at the age of 77  and his father died at 72 from lung cancer.  Review of Systems: The patient has been feeling generally unwell for the past week with loss of appetite  fatigue  night sweats  and low-grade fevers. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  cough  abdominal pain  dysuria  or changes in bowel habit.  HPI: His symptoms have gradually progressed over the past week. He has previously been fit and well and his symptoms are a departure from his baseline health.  Current Medications: No regular medications due to poor compliance.  Signs and Symptoms: Temperature is 38.6 °C (101.5 °F)  BP is 110/70 mm Hg  HR is 110/min  and RR is 18/min. Physical examination reveals pallor  poor dental hygiene  needle track marks on the forearms. There are condylomata lata on the palms and soles. Cardiac examination reveals a new-onset grade III/VI systolic murmur heard best at the apex.  Laboratory tests: Waiting for results.  Problem Representation Summary: This is a case of a 65-year-old male with a significant history of IV drug use and Hepatitis C presenting with a week-long history of malaise  poor appetite  fevers  and new murmur. The clinical picture suggests possible native-valve infective endocarditis  likely secondary to his IV drug use. This is to be confirmed with echocardiography and blood cultures.
14,6,38,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial38,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 65-year-old male retiree  who is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol sparingly  recently returned from a month-long hiking trip.   Presenting Issue: The patient presents with symptoms consisting of high-grade fever  chills  fatigue  weight loss  and a recently developed heart murmur. These symptoms have been ongoing for almost 3 weeks.  Characterization of the Problem: The patient has been previously healthy with no significant hospitalizations or major diseases; he takes no regular medications. He does have a history of poor oral health due to neglecting regular dental check-ups. Observed symptoms now include pale skin  low blood pressure  and rapid heart rate. The patient's physical examination reveals noticeable Osler's nodes on the fingers and toes  and Janeway lesions on the palms and soles.  Medical History: The patient's past medical history is quite uneventful save for occasional dental infections. However  the recently returned hiking trip involved him visiting several remote locations where medical hygiene might have been compromised.  Possible Diagnosis: Based on the presentation and patient's history  a possible diagnosis could be native-valve infective endocarditis  secondary to a bacteremia that may have potentially seeded from the dental infections due to poor oral hygiene.  Immediate Actions: Immediate confirmatory tests include blood culture to identify potential bacteria and an echocardiogram to visualize the heart valves. Begin empirical antibiotic therapy whilst awaiting culture results. Additionally  arrange a dental examination and consultation with an infectious disease specialist to gain a multidisciplinary approach to treatment.   Monitoring Progress: Patient progress should be closely monitored  documenting any changes in symptoms  and adjusting treatment based on culture results. Any complications should prompt additional investigations such as a CT if there's suspicion of emboli.

Presenting Complaints: The patient presents with a recent history of intermittent fevers  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss over the past month. Also complains of general malaise and shortness of breath on exertion.  Past Medical History: From the past medical records  the patient was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago and is on oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has Hypertension and is on antihypertensive medication. His records also reveal a previous dental procedure performed 2 months ago. The patient has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections over the past year. There is also a known history of Mild Hemophilia A.  Family History: Mother suffered from an ischemic heart disease  and father had diabetes and hypertension.  Social History: The patient is married  has two children  is a retired teacher  and has no known drug or substance abuse. He lives with his spouse. He maintains moderate physical activity and follows a balanced diet most times. He has not traveled outside of his city recently.  Relevant Past Surgical History: No significant past surgical history is on his medical records.   Medication History: - Metformin for Type II Diabetes - Enalapril for Hypertension - Factor VIII as needed during bleeding episodes  Allergy: No known drug allergies.  Immunization History: - Influenza vaccine annually - Pneumococcal vaccine  Possible Problem: The patient's symptoms suggest a possible case of Infective Endocarditis  which could have been triggered by a dental procedure carried out recently  given the fact that the heart valves are native and the bacteria from the mouth might have made entry through that procedure. The situation is complicated further by the presence of diabetes  hypertension  and hemophilia A in the patient's medical history. These factors may result in poor wound healing  increased risk of bacterial endocarditis  and compromised immune responses respectively  increasing the risk for complications.
14,6,40,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial40,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   A 65-year-old Caucasian male  non-smoker and moderate daily alcohol drinker presents with high grade fever  chills  malaise  fatigue  weight loss  and new-onset heart murmur  suggestive of native valve infective endocarditis.  Demographics:  The patient is a retired teacher and lives with his wife in the urban environment. The patient does not report any recent travel or any significant exposure to infectious disease. His immunizations are up-to-date.  Past Medical History:  His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is being controlled with oral antidiabetic medications. He also suffers from hypertension for which he’s under ACE inhibitors therapy. The patient underwent a dental procedure two months ago. He also reports a history of gout and occasional episodes of transient ischemic attacks. There is no past history of any invasive surgical procedure or intravenous drug use.   Family History:  There is a family history of cardiovascular disease. His father died of a heart attack at the age of 70.  Social History:  The patient is a non-smoker but does report the consumption of alcohol. He drinks a moderate amount of wine daily. He also reports a sedentary lifestyle  with minimal physical activity.  Medication History:  His regular medications are Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Colchicine for gout. There’s no known drug allergy history.   Review of Systems:  General: Fever  chills  malaise  and significant weight loss over the past 4 weeks. Cardiovascular: New onset heart murmur  occasional shortness of breath on exertion. Neurological: Reports 2-3 episodes of transient visual loss and weakness of the left arm in the past.  Physical Examination:  Vitals: Pulse 96 beats/min  irregular; BP 140/90 mm of Hg  Temperature 100.5 F. Cardiovascular: New onset regurgitant murmur heard best at the cardiac apex. Skin: Few small  non-tender  erythematous nodules suggestive of Osler’s nodes were found on his palms and soles  along with hemorrhagic retinal lesions on fundoscopy suggestive of Roth spots.   Conclusion:  Taken altogether  the clinical scenario given the new onset murmur  fever  recent dental procedure  presence of Osler's nodes and Roth spots  points towards the possibility of native valve infective endocarditis. However  confirmatory diagnosis would require echocardiography and blood cultures.
14,6,41,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial41,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 68 years  Gender: Male Race: African American Occupation: Retired engineer Residence: Urban  Presenting Complaint: John has been experiencing persistent fever  chills  night sweats  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss over the past 3 weeks. John also mentioned occasional chest discomfort and shortness of breath. He noticed changes in the color of his urine  stating it has been dark recently.   Medical History: John was diagnosed with aortic stenosis 8 years ago; his condition was managed conservatively as he didn't want to opt for surgery. He also suffers from type 2 diabetes and hypertension for which he adheres to regular medication. John had a dental procedure for tooth extraction about a month ago.  Family History: John's father had heart disease and his mother had type 2 diabetes. His younger sister was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Lifestyle: John is a non-smoker and a moderate alcohol drinker. He enjoys walking his dog in the local park and is generally physically active.  Review of Systems: John mentions a decrease in appetite and difficulty in sleeping due to night sweats. He denies any joint pain  headache  skin rash or neurological symptoms.   The combination of his symptoms  medical history  and recent dental procedure indicates there's suspected infective endocarditis on his native heart valves. Further diagnostics  including blood cultures  echocardiography  and potentially cardiac CT or MRI would be the next steps in confirming the diagnosis and determining treatment options. A consultation with the Infectious Diseases and Cardiology team is very likely in this scenario.   Specific cultures and sensitivities will be necessary to understand the causative bacteria and best antibiotic treatment. If confirmed  the severity of the disease and the condition of his native valves will direct the decision between medical therapy  surgical intervention  or a combination of both. His comorbid conditions  including poorly controlled diabetes  may complicate treatment or slow his recovery.

Further Investigation: He will need further investigations  including blood cultures  echocardiography  and possibly a cardiac CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease and valve damage.   Management: Patient treatment would likely include prolonged antibiotic therapy to treat the infective endocarditis  followed by appropriate plans for potential cardiac surgery if indicated. His other chronic conditions like diabetes will also need managing in the overall treatment plan.
14,6,47,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial47,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - A 62-year-old Caucasian male  Chief Complaint: - Persistent fever for the past two weeks - Shortness of breath - Weight loss & night sweats  Relevant Past Medical History:  - Has a well-managed type II diabetes mellitus diagnosed ten years ago - Diagnosed with hyperlipidemia treated with lifestyle modification & statins - Has a 35-pack year smoking history  has quit 5 years ago - Past history of dental abscess treated with antibiotics around one month ago  - No history of any illicit drug use - No history of recent hospitalization or any invasive procedures - No history of rheumatic heart disease or any structural heart disease - His father had a history of cardiac disease  Current Medications:  - Metformin for diabetes - Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia  Social History:  - He lives alone  and is retired. He worked as an engineer - Drinks alcohol occasionally - No travel history in recent months   This high-risk patient with a significant medical history of diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  presenting with recent onset fever  weight loss  and shortness of breath  may be developing native-valve infective endocarditis  possibly due to a non-hospital acquired infection. Further evaluation is needed with laboratory tests  imaging  and possibly blood cultures.
14,6,48,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial48,Name: John Doe Gender: Male Age: 65 years Occupation: Retired high school teacher  Main Complaint: Recurring fever  chest pain  fatigue  loss of appetite  and weight loss  Taking History: John is a 65-year-old retired high school teacher who presents with a two-week history of persistent fever  fatigue  loss of appetite  and weight loss. He also complains of chest pain and mild shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: John has been generally healthy in his life before his chronic illnesses. He has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for the last 10 years and hypertension for 5 years. His diabetes is controlled with Metformin  and he is managing his hypertension with Lisinopril.   John has had a past history of dental abscesses which required recurrent dental surgery. His last dental surgery was 3 months ago.  Family History: No history of heart diseases  infectious diseases  or autoimmune diseases in his immediate family. His father died due to lung cancer and his mother due to aging.  Social History: John has been living alone since his wife passed away 3 years ago. He smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years but has significantly reduced the consumption over the past year. He consumes alcohol occasionally during social gatherings and denies any drug abuse. Follows a balanced diet but recently hasn't been much of an appetite. He maintains good personal hygiene but admits poor dental hygiene.   Physical Examination: John appears fatigued. Vital signs reveal mild tachycardia with regular rhythm and a low-grade fever. The cardiac examination reveals a new grade III systolic murmur. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable  with no evidence of Osler's nodes  Janeway lesions  or Roth spots.  Based on all this  we suspect John has native-valve infective endocarditis. This is likely secondary to Streptococcus viridans or Staphylococcus aureus (the common bacterial pathogens for endocarditis)  possibly introduced during his recent dental procedure. A thorough investigation  including blood cultures and echocardiography  is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy.   The considerable history of cigarette smoking conditions John to a higher risk of respiratory diseases  including pulmonary complications of infective endocarditis like septic pulmonary emboli. His diabetes imbues a general higher risk of infections  poor wound healing  and potential poorer outcomes in endocarditis.

He recently developed localized joint pain in his left knee. He denies any recent dental work or harm reduction practices. He has no family history of heart disease or valve disorders. He was initially treated for flu but his symptoms have progressively worsened and no improvements were noted despite symptomatic treatment at a local clinic.  On physical examination  salient findings include pallor  low-grade fever and a new murmur on auscultation in the mitral valve area. A thorough family history has ruled out any genetic or connective tissue disorders.  Possible Diagnosis: Based on the above clinical findings and his history  the working diagnosis is Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis.   Planning: - Blood culture: To identify causative organism - Transesophageal echocardiography: To visualize the heart valves and confirm diagnosis - Baseline kidney and liver function test: To manage therapy effectively considering patient's past history of Hepatitis C.  - Revaluate hypertension management plan: Evaluating the patient's response to Lisinopril in light of the new diagnosis  may need to adjust or change antihypertensive medication.   References: - As a patient with past IV drug use  the patient is at a higher risk to develop an endovascular infection.  - New cardiac murmur along with persistent fever  shortness breath and history of IV drug abuse raises concerns for infective endocarditis.  - Transesophageal echocardiography is necessary as it has high sensitivity and specificity in detecting infective endocarditis compared to transthoracic echo.  - Given the age and history of this patient  it's necessary to assess comprehensive organ functions.

14,6,60,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial60,Problem Representation:  Patient:  A 60-year-old Caucasian male from an urban setting presents to the emergency room with a three week history of fevers  night sweats  weight loss  and a new onset of heart murmur.  Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) but claims to have been sober for the last five years. He has a 20 pack-year history of cigarette smoking and a moderate alcohol intake. The patient has a history of hypertension  which has been managed with medication for the last ten years.  Most recently  he was treated for a dental abscess two months ago  for which he was prescribed a course of antibiotics. The patient admits to poor oral hygiene.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient is experiencing persistent fever (>38 degrees Celsius)  chills  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss of nearly 10 kilograms over a month. He also reports experiencing night sweats and a decreased appetite.  The presence of general malaise as well as symptoms like fatigue and weight loss suggest systemic disease.  Physical examination:  Upon auscultation  a new onset heart murmur is audible  specifically a regurgitant murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border.  Suspicion of Infective Endocarditis:  Given the patient's history of IVDU  poor oral hygiene and a new onset heart murmur  there is a strong clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis. This is further supported by fever and other systemic signs.  At this stage  a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) would be the next step in investigating this patient's symptoms  given the high suspicion of infective endocarditis. Blood cultures should be drawn to identify any potential bacterial pathogens.  Patient's Risk Factors:  1. History of IVDU: Injection drug use is a common cause of infective endocarditis. 2. Poor dental hygiene: Poor oral hygiene and recent dental infection could provide a source of bacterial entry into the bloodstream. 3. Hypertension and smoking increase the risk of heart disease.    Given these elements  along with the symptoms  physical findings and risk factors  there is a high clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis.
14,6,61,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial61,Patient Profile:  1. Demographics:  The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith. He is a retired structural engineer and a widower with two adult children living independently. He is an ex-smoker having quit 10 years ago  has a history of moderate alcohol use but is currently abstinent. He does not have any known drug allergies.  2. Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of several comorbid psychological and physical conditions. His psychological conditions include chronic depression and anxiety. Physical conditions include hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus  both of which are well controlled with medication.  3. Family History:  There is a family history of heart disease; his father died of a myocardial infarction at 62 and his 65-year-old brother has angina. There is no family history of early onset cancer or neurological disorders.  4. Current Symptoms:  Mr. Smith presented to the hospital with a one-week history of fever  fatigue  poor appetite and night sweats. He reports having experienced intermittent episodes of sharp  stabbing chest pain  not related to exertion. On inspection  he looks unwell  lethargic  and has pallor and mild peripheral edema. Physical examination demonstrates a new systolic murmur  consistent with possible valvular lesions.  5. Initial Diagnosis:  In the context of his symptoms and the new cardiac murmur on clinical examination  an initial diagnosis of possible infective endocarditis is suspected.  6. Additional Relevant Information: Mr. Smith underwent a dental extraction 2 weeks ago. He has no known history of intravenous drug use  recent travel or exposure to sexually transmitted infections.  Problem Representation:  A 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and a recent dental extraction presents with fever  fatigue  anorexia  night sweats  and new onset of a heart murmur  raising suspicion for native valve infective endocarditis. His family history of heart disease and personal medical history place him at an elevated risk of cardiovascular complications requiring urgent investigation and management. The confirmation of this diagnosis would require further imaging  blood tests including blood cultures and possibly cardiac imaging. This patient’s case would be complex due to multiple comorbidities affecting his treatment options and prognosis.

Past Medical History: His past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed five years ago  which is under control with Metformin. He also has hypertension managed with Lisinopril for the past eight years. Further  he was diagnosed with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) two years ago and had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting done at that time. Historical dental issues include poor oral hygiene leading to gingivitis but does not regularly visit a dentist.  Family History: His father died in his late 60s from a myocardial infarction and his mother  now in her early 80s  has well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He has one older sister who is in good health.  Lifestyle: He quit smoking two years ago after his PCI but has been smoking two packs of cigarettes a day for the previous three decades. He works as an accountant  has a fairly sedentary lifestyle  and drinks socially. His diet is typically high in saturated fats and carbohydrates with limited fruits and vegetables.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  he appears unwell and has a temperature of 38.6°C. A cardiac examination reveals a new regurgitant murmur. There is no evidence of any peripheral stigmata of endocarditis on the skin or in the eye.  These symptoms along with his past medical history and lifestyle increase his likelihood of having native-valve infective endocarditis. His previous dental problems  poor oral hygiene  and diabetes are risk factors for this condition. Further diagnostic evaluation is required for confirmation.

He has no known drug use.   Family History:  His father had a heart disease that led to heart failure in his sixties  and his mother suffers from hypertension.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Davis has come for presenting symptoms including sustained fever (temperature of 38.6 degrees Celsius) along with fatigue and significant weight loss (about 10% of his overall weight in the last six months). He also reported experiencing shortness of breath and occasional night sweats.   Past Medical History: Mr. Davis had a history of high blood pressure that was diagnosed 5 years ago  but he has been inconsistent with his medication. He has had no known allergies  diabetes  or respiratory conditions. He had a dental procedure three months back.   Physical Examination: Upon examination  he appeared anxious and diaphoretic. His heart rate was elevated at 95 beats/minute and blood pressure was high at 145/95mmHg.  Initial Investigations: Blood tests and Echocardiogram were arranged to understand the cause of his symptoms.  This case primarily points towards a possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis  which is a life-threatening condition. Given the patient's heart's pre-existing condition  coupled with his present symptoms  the diagnosis seems plausible. The fact that he underwent a dental procedure where bacteria might have entered his bloodstream might have facilitated the progression of this infection. The possibility of Mr. Davis being infected with endocarditis needs to be addressed immediately.

14,6,79,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial79,Patient Profile:  - Name: John Smith - Age: 53 years - Gender: Male - Occupation: Construction Worker  Demographics:  John Smith is a Caucasian 53 years old male currently residing in New York  USA. He is a non-smoker  drinks socially and is not known to use any illicit drugs. He has a BMI of 29.5  which classifies him as overweight. Mr. Smith works as a construction worker  which potentially exposes him to a variety of dust particles and substances.  Past Medical History:  John Smith was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 7 years ago  which is currently managed with Metformin. Approximately five years ago  he faced an episode of rheumatic fever  for which he was treated. He also had an episode of community-acquired pneumonia 2 years ago and was treated effectively. Moreover  he underwent a meniscal repair surgery for a knee injury 10 years ago.   One year ago  he was diagnosed with moderate aortic valve stenosis  which has been managed conservatively since his cardiovascular risk and symptoms were low at the time. He has a regular follow-up with his cardiologist every six months and latest echocardiogram demonstrated stable aortic stenosis.  Current Situation:  For the last 2 weeks  Mr. Smith has been experience intermittent fever  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss. A raised concern is the recent arrhythmic sensation he noted and mild exertional chest discomfort  neither of which he experienced before. There is a concern that his existing cardiac valve abnormality might be complicated by a potential infective endocarditis considering his presenting symptoms. Update: His blood culture test came out to be positive for Staphylococcus aureus  indicating a possible diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Next Steps:  Mr. Smith needs to be referred to a tertiary care center for further workup  including a repeat echocardiogram to identify any valvular vegetations and  possibly  cardiac MRI. If the diagnosis of infective endocarditis is confirmed  he will require prolonged intravenous antibiotic treatment  and based on the response to antibiotics  he may need valve replacement surgery. His diabetes should be aggressively managed during these processes to minimize infection risk. Finally  considering overall risk  a cardiac evaluation for stable symptom progression is also necessary.

Summary:  This is a case of a 64-year-old male with a past medical history of aortic stenosis and recent dental procedure presenting with persistent fever  fatigue  weight loss  petechiae  and positive blood cultures revealing Streptococcus Viridans. These findings collectively suggest the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. His history of aortic valve disease and recent dental procedure are predisposing factors for the infection.
14,6,81,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial81,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 57 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Warehouse worker Marital Status: Married  two children  Presenting Complaints: John Doe has complained of persistent fever  chills  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss over the past 2-3 weeks. He also complains of muscle and joint pains  fatigue  and shortness of breath particularly on exertion.  Past Medical History: John is an ex-smoker and quit smoking 5 years ago after having been a pack-a-day smoker for three decades. He has a history of chronic alcohol abuse and was diagnosed with hepatic cirrhosis 2 years prior. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 7 years ago  which is being managed with metformin. In addition  he underwent dental extraction 1 month ago.  Physical Findings: Physical examination reveals a temperature of 100.4 F  blood pressure of 125/80 mmHg  heart rate of 105 beats per minute and respiration rate of 22 breaths per minute. An inspection of oral cavity signifies poor dental hygiene. Cardiac auscultation reveals a new-onset heart murmur.  Assessment: Considering John's presenting complaints  past medical history especially of poor dental hygiene  and physical examination findings  a differential diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis should be contemplated.  Interventions: John is referred to a cardiologist for further investigations such as echocardiogram. Blood cultures have been suggested prior to any initiation of antibiotics. His dentist has also been informed about his current health status as likely infective endocarditis could be secondary to his dental issues. His liver function tests and glucose levels are scheduled to be monitored regularly due to his history of hepatic cirrhosis and diabetes. He has also been counseled about maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups. He is encouraged to maintain a balanced diet with minimal consumption of alcohol.  Support and Risk Management: Education about infective endocarditis and its implications has been provided to John’s family to help in supporting his care at home. John has been counseled about the importance of follow-ups and adhering to medication in order to manage his medical conditions. His workplace has been advised about his health condition and the need for him to reduce strenuous activities. As part of risk management  routine evaluations are scheduled to monitor the progression of the disease and effectiveness of treatment.

14,6,89,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial89,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 65 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Civil Engineer (Retired)  Presentation:  Mr. Doe presents with a few weeks history of intermittent fever  night sweats  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss. He had been attributing his symptoms to aging and seasonal flu. But the persistence of symptoms and an episode of chills and shortness of breath brought him to seek medical attention.  Medical History:  He was diagnosed with rheumatic fever at the age of 20  which left him with mild mitral stenosis  but he has been asymptomatic for most of his life. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus ten years ago and has been managing it with metformin. He also suffers from hypertension  for which he takes lisinopril. He had dental work done approximately 1 month ago.  Family History:  No significant family history of heart diseases. His mother had type 2 diabetes and his father died of lung cancer.  Social History:  Mr. Doe does not smoke or consume alcohol. He retired five years ago and lives with his wife. He has been trying to maintain an active lifestyle post-retirement and takes regular walks in his neighborhood park.  Medications:  Metformin for type 2 diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. No known drug allergies.  Recent Investigations:  Physical examination reveals a new heart murmur  splinter hemorrhages under his nails  and Janeway lesions on his palms and soles. His resting heart rate is slightly elevated and blood pressure is within normal range.  Work up includes a blood culture to identify the causative organism  and investigations for possible septicemia  an echo for assessing the condition of the valves and vegetation and a chest x-ray for assessing the lung field. The symptoms  history  and new heart murmurs in this patient suggest a possible diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis  particularly given his history of rheumatic heart disease and recent dental work. His age  sex  and comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension further enhance his risk profile.
14,6,90,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial90,Problem Representation:  Demographics and Background: A 65-year-old male presenting for evaluation of intermittent fever and lethargy over the past three weeks. He also noticeably lost weight during this period. He is married  living with his wife  and is a retired school teacher. He is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol.  Medical History: He has been a long-term diabetic (Type 2) for 20 years on oral antidiabetic drugs and has a history of Rheumatic heart disease during his childhood  but he reports no cardiac symptoms thereafter. He also had a history of a dental procedure around 4 weeks ago. Additionally  he has hyperlipidemia and is on statins; he does not have any known drug allergies.  Exposure History: He lives in a suburban residential area with no exposure to farms  wild animals  or recent travel. His dental procedure 4 weeks ago involved tooth extraction.  Clinical Exam: Upon examination  he appears fatigued  pale  and cachectic. He has a diastolic murmur on auscultation  splenomegaly on abdominal examination  and petechiae on extremities. He also has Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes.  Laboratory Findings: His blood tests show normocytic anemia and his blood cultures are pending. His EKG and Chest X-ray are normal  but echocardiogram shows vegetations on the mitral valve suggestive of endocarditis.  Clinical Question: In a 65-year-old man with a history of diabetes  rheumatic heart disease  dental procedures  presenting with features of subacute infective endocarditis  what is the best course of antibiotics and is surgical intervention required?  Reasoning: This patient has several risk factors that increase his likelihood of developing native-valve infective endocarditis  including a history of rheumatic heart disease and recent dental procedure. His clinical findings indicate the presence of endocarditis with cardiac involvement  necessitating an aggressive treatment plan with appropriate antibiotics. Management must also consider the need for surgical intervention  dependent on the severity of his condition and his response to initial treatments.

Family history: Father: Passed away at 74 due to myocardial infarction. Mother: Suffered from rheumatoid arthritis  alive  aged 92. Brother: Alive  59  with history of colon cancer. Sister: Alive  55  fit and healthy.  Risk factors: Existing heart condition (mitral valve prolapse)  poor dental hygiene (has not been to a dentist for a couple of years)  underwent an invasive procedure (prostatectomy)  aging  diabetes  hypertension.  Allergies: No known drug allergies.  Immunization history:  Flu vaccine - annually  last received 7 months ago. Pneumococcal vaccine - received 5 years ago. Covid-19 vaccine - Fully vaccinated  last received 4 months ago.  Product use history:  No history of illicit drug use or tobacco consumption.  Current medications:  1. Metoprolol for Hypertension and Mitral valve prolapse. 2. Metformin for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.  As per the problem representation  the possible differential diagnosis can be native-valve infective endocarditis due to previous native heart valve disease combined with the present symptoms. Further investigations including blood cultures  transthoracic echocardiogram should be conducted to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment plan should consist of appropriate antibiotics as per culture sensitivity and close follow-up. Surgical management could also be considered if indicated.
14,6,93,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial93,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographics: A 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer  married with two adult children  non-smoker  with a moderate alcohol consumption of 1-2 glasses of red wine a night.  Presenting Problem: Patient presents to the clinic with a 2-week history of recurrent fever (with temperatures recorded up to 39 Celsius  or 102.2 Fahrenheit)  malaise  and unexplained weight loss. He also reports night sweats and noted a decline in exercise tolerance due to fatigue.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of mitral valve prolapse without significant regurgitation  diagnosed 10 years ago. He is also hypertensive  well controlled on a single medication. His family history is remarkable; his father died of myocardial infarction at 67 years  and his mother died of stroke at 74. He denies any history of intravenous drug abuse or recent dental procedures  tattoos or piercings  and any allergies.  Physical examination: Physical examination revealed poor dental hygiene. Cardiac auscultation showed a high-pitched blowing holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex radiating to the axilla indicative of mitral regurgitation. He also displayed subungual hemorrhages (splinter hemorrhages) on examination of the nails. His vital signs were stable with signs of fever.  The clinical presentation of fever  in a patient with an existing heart condition (mitral valve prolapse)  the presentation of a new murmur  and other accompanying signs and symptoms suggest the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis. More diagnostic tests (such as blood cultures and an echocardiogram) would be needed to confirm this diagnosis  and further management would be required according to the results.

14,6,95,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial95,Problem Representation:  Patient Demographic Information: The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  who presents with symptoms such as fever  malaise  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss over the past few weeks. He lives in a suburban area  is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of Type II diabetes mellitus that is well-controlled with metformin. He also suffers from mild hypertension for which he has been prescribed Lisinopril. The patient has hypersensitivity to penicillin. No reported history of sexual transmitted diseases  intravenous drug use  or dental procedures recently. He had a surgical procedure for the removal of gallbladder stones about 10 years ago. No reported family history of endocarditis or any heart diseases.  Recent Problems: 4 weeks ago  the patient started experiencing fatigue  general malaise  and high fever. He also reported a loss of appetite and moderate  unexplained weight loss. The patient complains of persistent night sweats and intermittent red spots on his palms and soles. He did not seek medical attention initially  expecting the symptoms to resolve spontaneously.  Primary Problem: The patient's condition  his symptoms of fever  weight loss  night sweats  malaise  and the appearance of red spots on the skin are consistent with a presentation of infective endocarditis primarily affecting a native heart valve.  Risk Factors: The presence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension does increase the patient's susceptibility to develop infections including endocarditis. His age and male gender may also increase the risk slightly.  Overall  investigating a diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis is plausible considering the patient's symptoms and history. Appropriate tests and cultures are required to confirm the diagnosis  identify the microorganism responsible  and plan treatment.
14,6,96,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial96,Patient Profile: - Age: 60 years old - Gender: Male - Occupation: Retired Accountant - Social History: Non-smoker  occasionally consumes alcohol  no history of recreational drug use  Past Medical History: - Hypertension - Type II Diabetes Mellitus - High cholesterol - No history of heart disease  surgery or valve replacements - No history of rheumatic fever - No history of IV drug abuse  Presenting Complaint: - Has been experiencing intermittent fevers over the past week  highest recorded temperature at 39.5°C. - Loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss noted over last two weeks - Complaints of general fatigue and muscle weakness. - Has noted increased breathlessness on exertion over the last few days.  On Examination: - BP: 140/85 mmHg - PR: 90 bpm - RR: 18/min - Temp: 38.5°C - Heart: A new murmur noted on auscultation - Lungs: Normal vesicular breath sounds; no added sounds - Non-pitting peripheral edema detected on bilateral lower limbs  Given the above presentation  the hypothesis would be that the patient might be suffering from native-valve infective endocarditis (IE). Further diagnostic tests including blood cultures  complete blood count  and echocardiogram would be recommended to confirm the diagnosis. The persistent fever  new murmur  and clinical signs of heart failure (fatigue  dyspnoea on exertion  peripheral edema) are indicative of IE. The patient's demographic profile and past medical history of conditions like hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus that predispose to vascular diseases make this a probable diagnosis.

He is a smoker with a 30-pack year history and reports occasional alcohol consumption. He works as an electrician and has no known drug allergies.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of type II diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  all of which are managed with medication  as well as a past myocardial infarction treated with angioplasty and stent placement. He experienced no post-procedural complications. He does not have a family history of cardiovascular disease but his father had type II diabetes.   Current Presentation: He has been experiencing intermittent  low-grade fevers for a few weeks  accompanied by chills  fatigue  and a loss of appetite. Additionally  he complains of new-onset weakness in his right hand  poor coordination and a sudden  sharp and severe headache which prompted him to seek medical attention.  Physical Examination Findings: Upon physical examination  he appears fatigued and slightly diaphoretic. His vital signs reveal a fever of 38.3°C (100.9°F)  heart rate of 90 beats per minute  blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg  and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 96% in room air. Auscultation of his heart reveals a new murmur suggestive of mitral regurgitation.  Diagnostic Findings: Complete blood count reveals leukocytosis and mild anemia. Blood cultures demonstrate growth of Streptococcus sanguis. Neurological imaging identifies a small right parietal infarct. Echocardiogram shows vegetations on the mitral valve.  Problem Statement: This problem involves a 60-year-old male with a history of extensive cardiovascular disease who presents with fever  new-onset neurological symptoms  and a newly appreciated murmur. His blood cultures reveal bacteremia with Streptococcus sanguis and echocardiogram confirms the presence of vegetations on the mitral valve. The constellation of these findings strongly suggests infective endocarditis affecting a native valve  leading to septic emboli and stroke. This condition may precipitate a conduction disturbance  acute heart failure  or another embolic event  which could potentially be life-threatening.
14,6,100,diagnosis14-prompt6-trial100,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presenting at the hospital with signs suggesting native-valve infective endocarditis.  Demographic Information: The patient is retired and lives with his wife in a suburban area. He is a non-smoker and drinks occasionally. His diet includes red meat and dairy products  and he goes for a walk every morning and evening for exercise.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is moderately controlled with oral antidiabetic medications. In addition  the patient also had a myocardial infarction 10 years ago  for which he received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Since then  he has been on aspirin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. There is no significant family history relevant to the current presentation.  History of Present Illness: The patient has been experiencing intermittent low-grade fevers associated with sweating for the past 15 days  along with malaise  anorexia  and weight loss. These symptoms have been progressively worsening over this period. A week ago  he noticed the appearance of painless red spots on his palms and soles. He also reported a new-onset heart murmur identified in a routine clinic visit.  Physical Examination: Physical examination reveals pale conjunctiva  Janeway's lesions on palms and soles  and splenomegaly. Cardiac exam reveals a harsh systolic murmur best heard at the apex and radiating to the axilla. No other significant findings were noted.  Given the patient's symptoms  signs  and relevant past medical history  the suspicion of infective endocarditis is high. The patient should undergo further investigations  such as blood culture and echocardiography  to confirm the diagnosis and guide the choice of antibiotic therapy. The patient's diabetes and past history of myocardial infarction might complicate the management  hence they should be carefully managed too.
14,7,1,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial1,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Female  Patient Information  A 70-year-old female  of Caucasian ethnicity  was admitted to the hospital with a one-week history of progressive fatigue  night sweats  and low-grade fever. She had no history of drug use or recent dental procedures. The patient recently experienced weight loss that was not intentional  though the amount was unspecified. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both under stable control with medication.   Clinical Findings  Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.3°C (100.94°F)  blood pressure of 130/80mmHg  pulse rate of 90 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. There was no evidence of skin or conjunctival pallor. Her cardiac examination revealed a grade II/VI systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal edge. She showed no signs of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis like Janeway lesions  Osler's nodes  or Roth's spots.    Diagnostic Focus and Assessment  Given the symptoms and physical findings  infective endocarditis was contemplated. Blood cultures were obtained  and empiric antibiotic therapy was started with vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Laboratory workup showed an elevated white blood cell count of 13 000/uL and C-reactive protein of 130 mg/L. Hepatic and renal function tests were normal. An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm.  Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large mobile vegetation (1.2 x 0.8 cm) on the aortic valve with moderate aortic regurgitation. Subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the presence of the vegetation.   The blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans  which is sensitive to penicillin  vancomycin and ceftriaxone. The diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was established.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment  Antibiotic therapy was switched to penicillin  which was administered for six weeks. Despite appropriate therapy  the patient's condition deteriorated due to severe congestive heart failure secondary to worsening aortic regurgitation. She was referred for surgical consultation  and eventually underwent successful aortic valve replacement. Following surgery  further antibiotic therapy was continued for two more weeks.  Follow-ups and Outcomes:  The patient made a full recovery and was discharged in a stable condition. Follow-up at 6 months showed no signs of recurrent infection or valvular dysfunction.  Patient Perspective:   The patient expressed gratitude for the medical care she received  stating that she felt significantly better following treatment  and expressed the intention to continue follow-ups regularly.  Informed Consent: The patient provided written informed consent for the publication of this case report.  Take-away:  This case underlines the importance of high clinical suspicion for infective endocarditis in elderly patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms like fatigue and fever. It underscores that early diagnosis and appropriate therapy  coupled sometimes with surgical intervention  are key to improved outcomes in native-valve infective endocarditis. 
14,7,2,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial2,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis In A 62-Year-Old Male With Past Medical History of Intravenous Drug Use - A Case Report  I. Patient Information:  The patient is a 62-year-old male  married  of Caucasian descent  and hail from a semi-rural community. He was referred to our hospital's emergency care unit by a local clinic.  II. Chief Complaint:  The patient presented with persistent chills  shortness of breath  extreme fatigue  and a recently developed  unexplained weight loss over the last four weeks. The patient also reported occasional episodes of night sweats and explained that attempts to warm up often didn't help.  III. Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history notable for end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis  hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus well-controlled with oral hypoglycemics. He also has a long history of intravenous drug use but had reportedly been clean for five years until a lapse into use approximately two months prior to presentation. There is no documented history of any heart diseases.  IV. Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  the patient had slightly elevated blood pressure  fever (38.5°C)  mottling of the skin over the extremities  and splinter hemorrhages were observed under his nails. On cardiac auscultation  a new systolic murmur was detected at the left sternal border. The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation  and the liver and spleen could not be palpated.  V. Diagnostic Assessment:  Given the clinical findings  infective endocarditis was suspected. Numerous blood cultures were taken  and the patient underwent a series of diagnostic tests such as a full blood count  renal profile  liver function tests  and C-reactive protein level. An echocardiogram was performed  revealing vegetations on the tricuspid valve. Blood cultures confirmed the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Hence  a diagnosis of community-acquired native-valve infective endocarditis was clinched.  VI. Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was initially started on empiric antibiotic therapy  which was later adjusted based on blood culture sensitivities. The treatment also included general supportive care and management of his underlying kidney disease. He was closely monitored for potential complications and improvements in his symptoms.   VII. Follow-Up and Outcomes:  Over several weeks of treatment  the patient showed gradual improvement in symptoms. Repeat echocardiography showed a decrease in the size of vegetations  and subsequent blood cultures turned out negative. After completing a 6-week course of appropriate antibiotics  the patient was discharged in stable condition. He was referred to an addiction counseling service and was continually monitored in the outpatient department to avoid a recurrence of his condition.  VIII. Patient Perspective:  The patient was relieved upon his recovery and shared his commitment towards sobriety  realizing that his recurrent substance abuse had imperiled his health.  IX. Informed Consent:  Informed patient consent was obtained for the publication of this case report.  This case underlines the prolonged covert clinical course of native-valve infective endocarditis  particularly in patients with a history of intravenous drug use. Despite being uncommon  it should be included in the differential diagnosis in individuals presenting with unexplained symptoms  such as fever  persistent chills  and malaise  particularly in those with past or present substance abuse.
14,7,3,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial3,Case Report:  Patient Information:  A 54-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. B was presented to the hospital emergency department. His primary complaints were fever  fatigue  weight loss  and night sweats. He lives in a urban residence and is currently unemployed.   Clinical findings:  The patient was initially alert and oriented but appeared visibly fatigued. He exhibited signs of pallor. His vital signs were recorded as follows: Temperature- 38.8°C; Blood Pressure- 140/90 mmHg; Heart-rate- 112 beats/min  irregular; Respiratory rate - 20 Breaths/min; Oxygen saturation - 95%.   On cardiac examination  a new murmur of mitral regurgitation complicated by pulmonary edema was noted. Splinter hemorrhages  Osler nodes  and Janeway lesions were present  suggesting an endovascular infection. No history of intravenous drug use was reported.  Past Medical History:  His medical history included hypertensive cardiovascular disease and peptic ulcer disease  for which he was being treated with a calcium channel blocker and proton pump inhibitor respectively. No known allergies were reported. He is a smoker with a 30 pack-year history but does not consume alcohol or illicit drugs. No prior surgeries or hospitalizations were listed.  Diagnostic Focus  Assessment and Therapeutic Intervention:  Blood cultures were drawn  and the patient was started on empiric antibiotic therapy given the high suspicion of infective endocarditis. Subsequent blood cultures demonstrated the presence of Viridans group Streptococci. In addition  a transthoracic echocardiogram report showed vegetation on the native mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Upon confirmation of diagnosis  the patient was continued on targeted intravenous antibiotic therapy guided by culture sensitivity. In consultation with Cardiothoracic Surgery  it was determined that due to the patient's symptom severity  surgical intervention  specifically mitral valve replacement  was necessary.  Follow-up Case Outcome:  Postoperatively  Mr. B made a steady recovery. His antibiotic course was completed  and subsequent blood cultures were negative. He showed no signs of heart failure  and his symptoms significantly improved. On follow-up outpatient visit  the patient expressed a willingness to quit smoking and agreed to regular check-ups for early detection of any recurrence of the disease.   Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of recognizing clinical signs of infective endocarditis in patients presenting with fever and a new heart murmur. Despite having no significant past history of valve disease or intravenous drug use  this patient developed severe native-valve endocarditis  necessitating surgical intervention. The case should encourage physicians to include infective endocarditis in their differential diagnosis  even in the relatively low-risk individuals.

He lives with his wife and two college-age kids. He has a history of occasional alcohol consumption and is a non-smoker. His family has a history of cardiac problems  with his father having passed away in his late 60s due to heart failure.  Presenting Problem The patient complained of persistent fever  fatigue  night sweats  unintentional weight loss (approximately 7 kg over the past three months)  and intermittent chest pain for the past two weeks. He also reported experiencing mild to moderate joint and muscle aches  generalized weakness  and a decrease in appetite. He confirmed no recent travels  major illnesses  or any significant changes in his diet or lifestyle.   Past Medical History The patient was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  for which he has been managing through lifestyle modifications and oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has a history of hypertension for 10 years  currently controlled with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (Lisinopril). He was briefly on statins five years ago to treat moderate hypercholesterolemia but stopped finally due to muscle pain side effects. He had no previous history of heart diseases  rheumatic fever  or recent dental procedures. He had received medical treatment for pneumonia three years ago.  Clinical Findings Physical examination revealed mild pallor  a low-grade fever (38.1°C)  and a systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation. Chest examination appeared clear  and no hepatosplenomegaly or peripheral stigmata of endocarditis was evident. Blood pressure was 130/85 mmHg  pulse rate was 88 beats/min  and he had a respiration rate of 16 breaths/min.  Diagnosis and Management Investigations  including a full blood count  liver and renal function tests  and chest X-ray  were conducted. Elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein)  abnormal liver function tests  normocytic normochromic anemia  and leukocytosis were noted. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans. An echocardiogram confirmed valvular vegetations and mild aortic regurgitation consistent with a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   The patient was admitted and initiated on high-dose intravenous antibiotics as per local guidelines and the infectious diseases team's advice. After seeing a significant improvement  he was discharged with a plan for closely monitored long-term outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy. He was also referred to a cardiologist for ongoing management of his heart condition and potential surgical considerations.    Due to his history with diabetes and hypertension  added attention was given. In addition  health education on lifestyle modifications and regular follow-ups to monitor blood pressure  blood glucose levels  and the appropriate management of his health conditions was arranged.  This case portrays the complexities and the high index of suspicion necessary to diagnose native-valve infective endocarditis  particularly in a patient with pre-existing chronic diseases.

The patient is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. He works as a mechanic and has no known history of illicit drug use. He has no known drug allergies. His family history revealed that he has a father with cardiovascular disease.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of rheumatic fever during his childhood and a recently diagnosed uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. He does not have any past medical history related to valvular heart disease  immunosuppression  or congenital heart disease.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Routine blood investigations revealed elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were raised. His blood cultured positive for Staphylococcus aureus. An echocardiogram was performed that showed vegetation on the mitral valve indicative of infective endocarditis.  Treatment: The patient was immediately started on empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy with Gentamicin and Vancomycin  which was later switched to IV Oxacillin  based on blood culture and sensitivity results. His blood sugar levels were managed with insulin therapy. He was also provided with supportive care for symptom management.  Progress and Outcome:  After ten days of antibiotic treatment  the patient's fever and chest pain subsided. Follow-up blood cultures were negative  suggesting successful eradication of infection. However  a repeat echocardiogram showed significant mitral regurgitation indicating valvular damage. The patient was then referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon and underwent successful mitral valve repair surgery.  The patient was discharged with a one-month supply of oral Oxacillin and a strict follow-up schedule. He was given lifestyle modification advice including appropriate diet  regular exercise  and strict control of his diabetes.  Discussion:  This report emphasizes the importance of considering native-valve infective endocarditis in diabetic patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms like fever  fatigue  and breathlessness. Early diagnosis and aggressive management with suitable antibiotics are crucial to prevent complications such as heart failure  systemic embolization  and destructive valvular disease.

14,7,8,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial8,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Report  Introduction: We report a case of a 67-year-old male suffering from native-valve infective endocarditis (IE).  Patient Information: Mr. XX  a Caucasian male  resides in Rural town  Montana. He is a retired mechanic  a smoker with a 40-pack year history  and moderate alcohol consumer. The patient has a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Clinical Findings: Mr. XX presented to the emergency department (ED) with a two-week history of intermittent fevers  chills  malaise  and unintended weight loss approximating 10 pounds in the last month. Additionally  he complained of chest discomfort with exertion  progressively worsening over the recent weeks.  Diagnostic Assessment: Clinical examination revealed a temperature of 38.6°C  heart rate of 98 beats/min  and blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg. Heart examination revealed a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Splinter haemorrhages under the nail beds were noted. A complete blood count showed leukocytosis (WBC count of 13 000/uL)  anemia (Hemoglobin at 10.3 g/dL)  and raised ESR (50 mm/hr). Blood cultures were drawn  and after 48 hours  grew Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with Oxacillin and Gentamicin.  Trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated a large vegetation on the aortic valve with significant regurgitation suggestive of valve perforation. No signs of abscess formation or dehiscence was noted.  Therapeutic Intervention: The Infectious Disease Team and Cardiovascular Surgeons were consulted. Considering the patient’s comorbidities  large aortic valve vegetation  valve perforation  and hemodynamic instability  as well as the pathogenicity of the isolated bacteria  the decision was to proceed with surgical intervention. He underwent successful aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis without any operative complications.  Follow Up and Outcome: The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful. His fever resolved  and his blood cultures were sterile by the 5th postoperative day. Repeat echocardiography showed normal prosthetic valve function without any residual vegetations or regurgitation. Antibiotics (Oxacillin and Gentamicin) were continued for 6 weeks post-discharge  and he was also started on lifelong aspirin therapy.  Conclusion: This case emphasized the importance of early recognition  prompt diagnosis  and management of infective endocarditis. This condition remains a major therapeutic challenge  particularly in patients with aortic valve vegetations causing severe regurgitation. Surgical intervention along with effective antibiotic therapy may improve outcomes significantly.  Note: This is a purely fictitious case and does not represent any real individuals or events.

14,7,9,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial9,Patient Information:   A 64-year-old Caucasian male patient presented previously to the outpatient department complaining of a two-week history of progressive malaise  fatigue  intermittent fever  chills  and night sweats. The patient lives in a suburban residential area and is retired after previously working as an accountant. There is no history of alcohol  tobacco  or illicit substance use and no recent travel activity. He has been on medications for hypertension and type 2 diabetes for the past 10 years. He has a prior history of dental procedures but reported not having any recent dental work done.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient had a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius  blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg  and pulse rate of 110 beats per minute. Heart auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur heard along the left lower sternal border. No apparent skin abnormalities nor peripheral stigmata of endocarditis were noted.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Blood tests indicated leukocytosis (WBC count of 14x10^9/L)  raised ESR (50 mm/h)  and moderately impaired renal function (creatinine 1.5 mg/dL). A set of three blood cultures were drawn which all turned positive for Streptococcus mitis  a viridans group streptococcus. Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) revealed a large  mobile vegetation on the ventricular side of the aortic valve  with some degree of aortic regurgitation but with preserved left ventricular systolic function.  Diagnosis:  The patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) based on the clinical presentation  positive blood cultures for Streptococcus mitis  and evidence of vegetation on the aortic valve seen on TTE  meeting the Duke Criteria for the diagnosis of IE.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was initially started on empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin. Once blood culture results were known  the regimen was adapted to a 4-week course of high-dose intravenous penicillin G and gentamicin  as recommended for native-valve IE caused by viridans group streptococci. Monitoring of serum antibiotic levels and renal function was performed to avoid nephrotoxicity.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  He showed good clinical response to the treatment with resolution of fever after 1 week and improvement of fatigue and malaise. Serial blood cultures turned negative and control TTE showed a reduction in vegetation size. The patient completed the 4-week antibiotic course. Surgical intervention was not required and the patient was discharged with close follow-up recommended. At six-month follow-up  the patient remained symptom-free without any signs of recurrent IE.   This case emphasizes the importance of early detection  prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy  and vigilant monitoring in managing patients with IE.

Case Report:  Introduction: A 72-year-old African-American male was admitted to our medical center with a clinical presentation suggestive of infective endocarditis.  Patient Information: The patient  a retired school principal  hails from a suburban setting. He lives with his son and daughter-in-law and has no history of alcohol or tobacco use. His only travel history involves two trips to Canada three years ago. He has a known medical history of type 2 diabetes and stage 3 chronic kidney disease. He has no known allergies but has a moderate intolerance to high doses of both metformin and diuretics  causing mild gastrointestinal discomfort.  Clinical Findings: He presented with a two-week history of fever  fatigue  night sweats  exertional breathlessness  and loss of appetite. On physical examination  he was found to be febrile with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute and blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. Auscultation of his heart revealed a diastolic murmur at the apex suggestive of mitral regurgitation.   Diagnostic Assessment: Laboratory findings demonstrated elevated levels of leukocytes and C-reactive protein indicating an active inflammatory process. Renal parameters were consistent with chronic kidney disease stage 3  and random blood glucose was within acceptable range  suggestive of adequately controlled diabetes.  Transthoracic echocardiography revealed vegetations on the mitral valve. Blood cultures were also drawn and demonstrated growth of Streptococcus viridans  a common agent of native-valve endocarditis.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on intravenous Penicillin G and Gentamicin as per the AHA guidelines to treat Streptococcus viridans. He was also put on dialysis due to his escalating kidney symptoms.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: The therapy was successful  and the patient's symptoms improved dramatically over the next two weeks. Repeat echocardiography showed a marked reduction in the vegetation size. Unfortunately  his kidney function did not show significant improvement necessitating his continued requirement for dialysis. However  his diabetes was well controlled throughout.  Patient's Perspective: The patient was initially quite anxious due to the severity of his symptoms but has since expressed relief at his treatment's progress. He indicated his willingness to adhere to any necessary lifestyle changes  required medications  and dialysis sessions to manage his conditions.  Conclusion: This case underscores the serious implications of infective endocarditis in patients with comorbid chronic kidney disease and diabetes. Aggressive management with early initiation of appropriate antibiotics and dialysis can be life-saving in such complex scenarios.

She reports no known allergies to drugs or food.  II. Past Medical History The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both of which are under control with medication. Additionally  she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis five years ago  for which she takes methotrexate. The patient has no known history of heart diseases or any other major illnesses. Her family history conveys hereditary risk factors for cardiovascular diseases  with her mother passing away from a stroke and her father having a history of heart disease.  III. Presenting Complaint The patient was presented at the emergency department with high-grade fever  loss of appetite  unexpected weight loss  shortness of breath  and lethargy that persisted over the past three weeks. She also complained of joint pain  particularly in her knees and hands.  IV. Clinical Assessment On examination  the patient was conscious but pale. Upon auscultation  a diastolic murmur was audible. Blood pressure was slightly elevated at 145/89 mmHg  with a pulse rate of 98 beats per minute. The patient presented with slight tenderness at her left knee.  V. Investigation Blood test results showed elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein  indicating active inflammation. Echocardiography revealed vegetation on the native mitral valve suggesting infective endocarditis; no significant valve insufficiency was observed. Additionally  three sets of blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  VI. Treatment The patient was immediately placed on intravenous antibiotics - high-dose penicillin G and gentamicin. After 2 weeks of this regimen  the patient showed signs of improved clinical condition. Her appetite returned  and lethargy lessened.   VII. Follow Up Due to the advanced age and comorbid conditions  the patient was not considered eligible for valve replacement surgery. After four weeks on antibiotics therapy  the repeat blood cultures were negative and the liver function test results were normal. The patient was discharged from the hospital with close follow-up appointments with the cardiologist.   VIII. Conclusion Despite several comorbidities  the patient responded well to the conservative treatment strategy for native-valve infective endocarditis. Further close follow-up is required to monitor the condition of the mitral valve and to prevent potential complications.

Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  Laboratory tests revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 15.3 x 10^9/L (normal: 4-11 x 10^9/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 78 mm/h (normal: 0-22 mm/h). Blood culture grew Staphylococcus aureus  indicating bacterial infection. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pulmonary congestion or pneumonia. An electrocardiogram indicated sinus tachycardia but no signs of myocardial infarction.  A transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. It showed a large mobile vegetation on the mitral valve with valve destructive changes without significant regurgitation.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment:  The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. After blood culture results  the regimen was narrowed down to nafcillin  given the sensitivity of the isolated S. aureus. The patient's clinical condition slowly improved over the following week  with resolution of his fever and a decrease in his inflammatory indices.  Despite the initial medical management  the echocardiogram showed disease progression with persistent vegetation and mitral valve destruction. Given his complex condition and severity of valve destruction  involvement of cardiothoracic surgery for valve replacement was deemed necessary  and the patient was transferred to a tertiary care center for surgical intervention.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  Surgery was successfully performed without complications. Post-operative recovery was uneventful  and the patient was discharged on a prolonged course of antibiotics to complete six weeks of treatment. He was followed up in the Infectious Disease Clinic and showed good health status one month after discharge. He was also referred to a drug rehabilitation program.  Patient Perspective:  The patient was initially apprehensive about undergoing surgery. However  after a detailed discussion about the risks and benefits  he agreed to undergo valve replacement. Post-surgery  he expressed gratitude for his improved health status and committed to stopping IV drug use.  Informed Consent:  Written informed consent for the publication of this case report and any accompanying images was obtained from the patient.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis  especially in patients with a high-risk profile such as IV drug users. The management should involve not only appropriate antibiotic therapy but also timely surgical intervention when indicated. It also highlights the importance of addressing underlying social and behavioral factors in a holistic care approach.

She is employed as a school teacher and has a history of smoking  but quit ten years ago. She is not a known alcoholic or drug user. Her only noted family history is that of cardiovascular disease  affecting her father and grandfather in their later life.  Clinical Findings: The patient presented with chills  fatigue  night sweats  shortness of breath  and unexplained weight loss over the past two weeks. She also reported a mild intermittent fever that had been present for the same duration. She indicated a recent dental procedure about one month ago but was not given prophylactic antibiotics.  Diagnostic Assessment: Physical examination showed slightly elevated temperature  normal blood pressure  and increased heart rate. Auscultation revealed a heart murmur  not previously recorded. Lab results showed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)  indicating inflammation. Blood culture demonstrated the presence of Streptococcus viridans.  Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed vegetations on the tricuspid valve suggestive of native-valve endocarditis. Chest X-ray did not reveal any lung infiltrates or emboli  and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed mild tachycardia but was otherwise normal. The patient was tested negative for HIV and Hepatitis B and C.  Therapeutic Intervention: Intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated with Penicillin G and Gentamicin to cover Streptococcus viridans as per the current guidelines for native-valve endocarditis. The patient was closely monitored for signs of congestive heart failure  embolic events  and any adverse effects from the antibiotic therapy.  Outcome and Follow-up: The patient showed signs of clinical improvement after two weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy  with a decrease in inflammatory markers and resolution of fever. The decision for a surgical procedure was deferred considering her clinical improvement. She was discharged on a six-week course of oral antibiotic treatment and had a follow-up with a cardiologist every two months. The patient was also educated about the risk factors and importance of prophylactic antibiotic use before any invasive procedures including dental work.  After one year of initial presentation  the patient remains symptom-free and follow-up echocardiography shows no evidence of valve dysfunction or recurrence of infective endocarditis.

14,7,15,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial15,Title: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Male with Chronic Rheumatic Heart Disease  Introduction:  This report presents the case of an 82-year-old male suffering from native valve infective endocarditis  overlaid on a past medical history of chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The report aims to contribute to understanding the complexities in diagnosis  prognosis  and management of infective endocarditis in the presence of pre-existing valvular heart disease.  Case Presentation:  Patient’s Profile  Mr. X  an 82-year-old retired teacher  raised in the rural outskirts of California  presents with a history of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). He is a non-smoker  and denies alcohol or illicit drug use. His family history is significant  with his father and older brother each having suffered from heart disease.  The patient was referred to our clinic for further evaluation for a three weeks’ history of intermittent fever with chills  malaise  and dyspnea on exertion  which had been progressively worsening. He also reported a significant weight loss over the past two months. On further inquiry  no history of dental procedures  skin infections or recent hospitalizations was noted.  Clinical Findings  Upon physical examination  the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.3 °C  blood pressure was 130/85 mmHg  and pulse was 90 beats per minute. Cardiac examination showed a diastolic murmur in the mitral area. Spleen was palpable on deep palpation while no peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis were found.  Investigations and Diagnosis  Laboratory investigations revealed a raised total leucocyte count (14 200/cu mm) and elevated CRP (34mg/L). Blood cultures were drawn and empiric antibiotic therapy was started. The patient’s sputum was tested negative for tuberculosis.  Echocardiography revealed a large vegetation on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve  suggestive of infective endocarditis. The valve showed significant thickening  possibly due to his past history of RHD. Blood culture results later confirmed the presence of Streptococcus viridans  further supporting the diagnosis.  Management and Progress   The patient was hospitalized and continued on intravenous antibiotics  targeting Streptococcus viridans  as per the infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. Follow-up blood cultures showed no growth after 72 hours of antibiotics initiation.  The patient’s general condition gradually improved over a week; however  the dyspnea persisted. Repeated echocardiogram showed persistent large vegetation and worsening mitral stenosis.   Given his age  comorbid conditions  and risks associated with surgery  the decision for surgical intervention was deferred. He was discharged on prolonged course of antibiotics and advised close follow up.   Conclusion:  This case underlines the importance of considering native valve infective endocarditis  particularly in patients with a history of rheumatic heart disease presenting with prolonged fever and cardiac murmur. Early diagnosis and initiation of antibacterial therapy can considerably reduce morbidity and mortality; however  managing endocarditis overlaid on chronic RHD presents major challenges.

Her body mass index was recorded at 27 kg/m2 indicating that she is overweight. Her primary language was English and she lived alone. She was a retired teacher with an occasional alcohol consumption history but no history of smoking or recreational drug use. No known allergies were reported.  Past Medical History: She had a well-controlled hypertension for the past fifteen years managed with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors.) She had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis 5 years ago  managed by occasional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). She had also been diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia ten years ago and has been on statins. There was no history of heart surgery or any implanted cardiac devices. She had a pacemaker implanted three years ago due to sick sinus syndrome.  Presenting Complaints: The patient sought medical attention because of a 2-week history of worsening fever  chills  fatigue  and an unintentional weight loss. She also reported intermittent shortness of breath and a new-onset heart murmur noticed by her primary care physician.  Diagnosis: Physical examination revealed a low-grade fever (100.6°F) and cardiac auscultation found a diastolic murmur best heard at the left sternal edge. Blood cultures taken from her grew Streptococcus bovis and serologic markers showed elevated inflammatory markers. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed large vegetation on the mitral valve with moderate mitral regurgitation  highly indicative of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE).   Treatment and Outcome: The patient was immediately put on a course of intravenous antibiotics  to which S.bovis was sensitive. Her clinical status was monitored  and due to deteriorating cardiac function and development of heart failure  she was referred to cardiac surgery. Surgical intervention involved a mitral valve replacement  followed by completion of six weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Post-operative course was uneventful. Her subsequent blood cultures were negative. She is to follow up for regular reviews at the cardiology and infectious disease clinics.  This case highlights the significant role of early identification  appropriate antibiotic therapy  and timely surgical intervention in the management of native-valve IE  particularly in patients with underlying cardiac abnormalities like pacemaker presence.

14,7,20,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial20,Title: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Male: A Case Report  Abstract: A case of native-valve infective endocarditis in a 55-year-old Caucasian male was presented with non-specific  flu-like symptoms. A detailed evaluation suggested endocarditis. This case report highlights the importance of clinical suspicion and prompt intervention in the management of infective endocarditis  despite non-specific presenting symptoms.  Case Report:  Patient Information: A 55-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with a 14-day history of malaise  night sweats  and intermittent fevers. The patient was a non-smoker  moderate alcohol drinker  not on any regular medications and with no known drug allergies. He had no relevant exposures or travel history  and there was no family history suggestive of a hereditary health problem. The patient lived alone  worked as a plumber and denied intravenous drug use.   Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient looked systemically unwell  but hemodynamically stable. His body temperature was elevated at 38.8°C. A cardiac examination revealed a new systolic murmur. He had no peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis.   Diagnostic Assessment: Blood tests showed an elevated white cell count (WCC) of 15.0 x 109/l (4.0 - 11.0) and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) at 104 mg/l (<6). His renal function  liver profile were within normal limits. A set of blood cultures was drawn  which isolated Streptococcus viridans.   An echocardiogram was performed given the high clinical suspicion of the medium-risk profile of native-valve infective endocarditis. This confirmed the presence of an oscillating mass on the patient’s mitral valve consistent with infective endocarditis.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on empiric IV antibiotic therapy  which was later tailored based on sensitivity data. He received 6 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone and after completion of antibiotic therapy  the patient's symptoms had all but resolved  and inflammatory markers returned to normal.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: The follow-up echocardiogram showed resolution of the vegetation on the mitral valve and the patient was cleared of infection. He has since remained well  with no recurrence of symptoms.   Discussion: This case highlights the importance of considering a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis in patients presenting with non-specific flu-like symptoms such as malaise and night sweats. Clinicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion for this potentially life-threatening condition  especially in patients with new cardiac murmurs on examination. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are vital for a favorable prognosis.   Conclusion: Native-valve infective endocarditis should be considered in patients presenting with non-specific  flu-like symptoms  and clinical or echocardiographic evidence suggestive of endocarditis. Early recognition and treatment are essential to prevent serious complications and improve patient outcomes.

14,7,24,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial24,Case Report  Patient Identification: The patient  a 57-year-old male  Caucasian ethnicity  presented to the specialty clinic with a chief concern of progressive dyspnea and persistent fever. He resides in Tucson  Arizona  and is employed in manual labor. Relevant social history accounts for moderate alcohol use  occasional tobacco smoking  and no illicit drug use.  Clinical History: From the medical history review  the patient has been hypertensive for the past 15 years. He is also diabetic (Type II) for around 10 years and is taking Metformin for the same. He does not have any history of malignancy or apparent immunosuppression. No family history of heart disease is reported. He did not have any documented history of rheumatic fever or congenital heart disease.  Presenting Complaints: The patient reported experiencing symptoms for the past two weeks which includes moderate to high-grade fever  malaise  progressive shortness of breath  night sweats  and unquantified weight loss. He also reported reduced exercise tolerance and generalized weakness.  Clinical Examination: On physical examination  he appeared febrile and diaphoretic. Reduced breath sounds with basal crackles were evident on pulmonary auscultation. Cardiovascular examination revealed a grade 3/6 pansystolic murmur over the mitral area.  Investigations: Laboratory tests showed raised inflammatory markers (WBC count of 14x10^9/l  C-reactive protein of 100 mg/L). Blood cultures were also taken. Transthoracic echocardiography exposed vegetations on the mitral valve with moderate mitral regurgitation  suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans after 24 hours of incubation  which provides an account for the patient's underlying infection. The patient's serological markers for HIV  Hepatitis B  and Hepatitis C were negative  ruling out possible underlying immunosuppressive conditions. His chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple left lung based consolidations suggestive of septic emboli.  Management: The patient was started on empirical antibiotic therapy with intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin as per hospital's protocol for infective endocarditis  considering his allergic history to penicillins. Once the blood culture results were obtained  the treatment was streamlined to intravenous ceftriaxone.  Follow-up & Current Status: Over the course of two weeks  the patient's condition improved clinically  and he showed signs of recovery. Repeated blood cultures came back negative after one week of antibiotics  and the patient was continued on the same regimen for six weeks in total. Reporting 3-months after his initial diagnosis  the patient reported feeling significantly better and is continuing regular follow-up at the cardiology clinic and is currently being considered for valvular surgery.

No neurological deficits or immunological phenomena were observed.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Laboratory studies showed increased inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein was 180 mg/L  and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 45 mm/h). Blood cultures were taken  which grew Staphylococcus aureus. An echocardiogram revealed vegetation on the native mitral valve  irrespective of significant valve regurgitation or heart failure. Thus  the diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made according to the modified Duke criteria.   Therapeutic Intervention:  Empiric therapy was initiated promptly with intravenous vancomycin (30 mg/kg/day) and gentamicin (3 mg/kg/day) considering his risk factors and pending blood culture results. After confirming the organism as MSSA (Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) through blood culture susceptibility  the treatment was switch to intravenous nafcillin (9g/day) and gentamicin was continued.    Follow up and Outcome:  During a 6-week course of treatment  the patient's clinical state gradually improved. The patient's inflammatory markers normalized  and a repeat echocardiogram showed significantly reduced vegetation. He was discharged with instructions to complete a 6-week course of antibiotics and to abstain from intravenous drug use. Regular follow up was scheduled with cardiology  infectious disease  and addiction services.   Patient Perspective:   The patient expressed gratitude for the treatment received and recognized the severity of the disease. He showed strong motivation to abstain from future illicit drug use and wished to continue engagement in the addiction services treatment program.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of early recognition and prompt treatment in native-valve infective endocarditis  particularly in susceptible populations such as intravenous drug users.
14,7,26,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial26,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 67-year-old Caucasian Male - A Case Report  Introduction:  Native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) is a rare but serious infection involving the inner endocardium of the heart  often with fatal outcomes if left untreated. We present herein a case of NVIE in a 67-year-old Caucasian male.  Case Presentation: A 67-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes was admitted to the hospital with a two-week history of fatigue  weight loss  fever  and night sweats. He lived alone  was an ex-smoker and had no history of intravenous drug use  dental procedures or recent surgeries. He had no known allergies and was on metformin and lisinopril for his pre-existing conditions.  On examination  the patient had a fever of 38.5 °C  blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg  and his heart rate was 90 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed a pansystolic murmur in the aortic region. There was no peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis. His skin and sclera were normal and he showed no signs of vascular phenomena or immunological phenomena.  Laboratory findings showed an elevated white blood cell count of 14 500/ µL  hemoglobin was 10g/dL  and the platelet count was 200 000/ µL. Blood cultures were drawn and results demonstrated growth of Streptococcus bovis. Chest X-ray did not show any signs of infection or congestion.  Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed a large echogenic mass on the aortic valve consistent with vegetation  confirming the diagnosis of NVIE. No other valvular abnormalities were observed.  The patient was started on appropriate antibiotic therapy according to the identified microorganism (i.e.  Ceftriaxone and Gentamycin). He responded favorably to antibiotic therapy  with resolution of his fever and constitutional symptoms over the next few days. Repeat blood cultures after two weeks of antibiotics were negative.  Due to the size of the vegetation  ensuing valve damage and the risk of systemic embolization  a decision was taken to refer the patient for surgical evaluation. He successfully underwent aortic valve replacement surgery  with postoperative course being uneventful.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of NVIE  particularly in older patients with pre-existing comorbidities. High clinical suspicion  accurate blood culture  and TEE contributed to the successful management of NVIE in this case.

He is a non-smoker and rarely drinks alcohol. The patient is a construction worker and reports no recent travels or sick contacts.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of rheumatic fever in childhood and had been diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse ten years ago  for which he did not receive any surgical intervention  but was under ongoing surveillance. He denied prior use of intravenous drugs or any recent dental procedures.  Clinical Findings: His initial vital signs revealed a body temperature of 100.4°F  blood pressure of 120/80mmHg  pulse rate of 96/min  and respiratory rate of 16/min. The physical examination revealed a diastolic murmur perceived at the apex of the heart. There were no signs of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis. His chest was clear to auscultation  and there was no peripheral edema.   Diagnostic Assessment: Laboratory tests showed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). White cell count was slightly increased  and blood cultures were taken. Electrocardiogram demonstrated no significant changes. Chest X-ray was unremarkable.   Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed and revealed a vegetation on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve along with moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography  which confirmed these findings. Subsequently  blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  endorsing the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was started on empirical intravenous antibiotics adjusted later according to culture sensitivity  including ceftriaxone and gentamicin  under the care of an infectious disease specialist. He was also administered antipyretics for fever control.   Follow-up and Outcomes: After six weeks of antibiotic therapy  repeat imaging showed a reduction in vegetation size  and blood cultures were negative. He was discharged and referred to a cardiologist for ongoing management of his mitral valve disease. He was also educated about the importance of dental hygiene and regular dental visits to prevent future endocarditis episodes.  Patient’s Perspective: The patient was initially shocked by the diagnosis. He was not aware that his previous heart condition could result in such a severe disease. Nonetheless  he was relieved to notice improvements in his symptoms and committed to follow the prescribed regimen and necessary lifestyle modifications.  Informed Consent: The patient provided informed consent for the publication of this case report. Efforts have been made to maintain the anonymity of the patient.   Conclusion: This case emphasizes the fact that patients with mitral valve prolapse  especially with a prior history of rheumatic heart disease  are at an increased risk for native valve endocarditis.

Introduction  Native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE) is a serious infectious disease of the cardiovascular system  often associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It commonly involves infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus.  Case Presentation  A 72-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to our department complaining of ongoing intermittent fevers  fatigue  night sweats  and progressive dyspnea over the past three weeks. The patient’s medical history outlined a controlled case of Type 2 diabetes  hyperlipidemia and no known drug allergies. He was a former smoker and consumed alcoholic beverages socially  but had no illicit drug use. He reported no recent dental procedures or any invasive medical procedures.   Clinical Findings  Upon physical examination  the patient displayed a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius and heart murmur was present during auscultation. A series of blood tests were ordered which revealed elevated C-reactive protein levels  leucocytosis  and positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus. Anemia and mild kidney function impairment were also noted.   Diagnostic Assessment  An echocardiogram revealed a mobile vegetation on the aortic valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. No other valves appeared to be affected. The presence of Staphylococcus aureus was confirmed in multiple blood cultures  correlating with the patient’s presenting symptoms and the echocardiogram findings.  Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was started on intravenous flucloxacillin as per the Infective Endocarditis treatment guidelines for native-valve Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis. In addition to antibiotic therapy  supportive treatments were provided which consisted of fluid management and antipyretics.  Follow Up and Outcome  After two weeks of intravenous antibiotic treatment  the patient's symptoms gradually resolved. A repeated echocardiogram after six weeks of therapy revealed a significant reduction in the size of the vegetation. The patient was discharged with a four-week course of oral antibiotics and was advised to undertake regular outpatient follow-ups.  Conclusion  This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition and treatment of NVIE to avoid complications  such as metastatic infections and heart failure. It also reiterates the value of thorough history-taking in understanding the development and progression of the disease. 
14,7,29,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial29,Title: A Case Report of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis: A Challenge in the Management   Patient Demographics  The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. J  living in a suburban area. He was born and lived most of his life in Maryland  United States. He is a retired engineer  married with two adult children  and is a current smoker from the past 25 years with a daily consumption of 10 cigarettes. He lives alone with his wife and has Medicare insurance. The patient revealed a family history of heart diseases  with his father dying of a heart attack in his 60s.  Past Medical History  Historically  the patient has Type II Diabetes Mellitus  under control with oral hypoglycemics  and hypertension  managed with medication. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 5 years ago due to his smoking habit. His vaccinations  including pneumococcal and influenza  are updated according to age and chronic conditions. The patient does not have any known drug allergies.   Presenting Conditions  Mr. J presented at the emergency department with a complaint of high-grade fever  chills  fatigue  shortness of breath  and weight loss over the past two weeks. He additionally reported experiencing recent episodes of night sweats. He denied chest pain  cough  or other respiratory symptoms.  Clinical Findings  On examination  the patient appeared acutely ill  with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg  respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute  and fever of 39°C. Cardiac examination revealed a new systolic murmur. Laboratory findings included raised inflammatory markers  normocytic anemia  and urine analysis demonstrating microscopic hematuria. His blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a 1.5 cm vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment and Outcome  The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin and gentamicin in line with the recommended therapy for Streptococcus viridans infective endocarditis. Despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy  his condition did not improve satisfactorily and eventually required surgical management. He underwent mitral valve replacement surgery successfully and demonstrated significant clinical improvement post-surgical intervention. Following discharge  he was enrolled in a comprehensive disease management program which includes cardiologist  pulmonologist and endocrinologist consultations  along with strict smoking cessation counseling.  Conclusion  This case illustrates the challenges in managing a complicated case of native-valve infective endocarditis in a patient presenting with multiple comorbidities. A multidisciplinary approach to management and the necessity of surgical intervention were highlighted in this case. 
14,7,30,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial30,Patient Information:  Mr. J is a 57-year-old Caucasian male from a suburban area.  Clinical Findings:  Mr. J was admitted to the hospital reporting dyspnea  prolonged fever of two weeks  night sweats  fatigue  and decreased appetite. On physical examination  he was noted to have pale skin and enlarged  tender spleen with few lesions on the skin suggesting vasculitis. A heart murmur was also detected during a cardiovascular examination.   Medical History:  Mr. J has a history of Type II diabetes that is well-controlled by oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has hypertension treated with ACE inhibitors. There is no prior history of heart disease. He's a non-smoker  consumes moderate alcohol  and denies any illicit drug use.   Diagnostic Assessment:  In response to his symptoms and examination  blood cultures were ordered and demonstrated the growth of Streptococcus viridans consistent with bacteremia. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a valvular mass suggestive of vegetations on the mitral valve indicating infective endocarditis.   Therapeutic Intervention:  Mr. J was initiated on intravenous vancomycin therapy for initial empiric treatment. After positive blood culture results  the treatment was narrowed down to intravenous penicillin G and gentamicin. His therapy was planned for four weeks under close monitoring of his symptoms and laboratory parameters including liver function tests and renal function tests.  Follow Up and Outcomes:  Throughout the treatment  Mr. J was under regular monitoring for potential side effects and therapeutic response. His fever resolved after eight days into treatment and other symptoms also gradually decreased. A repeat blood culture came back negative on the 15th day of treatment. A follow-up echocardiogram post-treatment demonstrated the resolution of vegetations.   Teaching Points:  This case illustrates native-valve infective endocarditis without previous heart disease potentially linked with a suboptimal oral hygiene condition. It emphasises the importance of looking beyond the typical risk factors and being aware of infective endocarditis's varying clinical manifestations. It also highlights the need for a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis and treatment initiation in febrile patients  especially with findings suggestive of sepsis or vasculitis.   Patient consent was obtained for the case report.
14,7,31,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial31,Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Information: Mr. J  a 60-year-old male of Hispanic descent  was admitted to the hospital. He has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with metformin  hyperlipidemia managed with atorvastatin and hypertension controlled with a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. He doesn't have a history of IV drug use or any known heart valve disease.  Presenting Complaints: The patient presented with a 2-week history of intermittent high-grade fever associated with night sweats  generalized fatigue  unintended weight loss  and a new-onset poor appetite.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  the patient was moderately distressed  his BMI was 29.2  blood pressure was high at 160/90 mmHg  heart rate was 110 bpm and his temperature was elevated at 102.5 F. Cardiovascular examination revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the apex. Patients showed oral thrush and minor petechiae in his lower limbs upon further examination. There was no jugular venous distention  organomegaly  or peripheral edema.  Investigations: Laboratory studies showed leukocytosis (WBC 16×10⁹/L with 80% neutrophils) and elevated CRP of 18 mg/L. Blood cultures were taken and sent for analysis. EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy with no acute ischemia. Chest X-ray was unremarkable.  An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) exhibited thickening with a tiny vegetation on the mitral valve leaflets consistent with infective endocarditis (IE). Blood cultures returned positive for Streptococcus bovis.   Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis. His condition is potentially complicated by his age  history of hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and the source of infection associated with a high risk of systemic embolization.  Treatment: The patient was started on IV Penicillin G and Gentamycin as per IDSA guidelines  antipyretic for fever control  and all his chronic medications were continued as before. Consultation with cardiology and infectious disease specialists was sought for further management.  After 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment  the patient's symptoms improved significantly. A repeat echocardiogram showed a reduced size of vegetations on the mitral valve.  Because of the presence of Streptococcus bovis  which is associated with colorectal neoplasia  the patient was referred to gastrointestinal specialists for a colonoscopy.  This case should remind clinicians to consider infective endocarditis in the differential diagnosis when patients with known risk factors present with persistent fever and other systemic symptoms. The case also highlights the importance of identifying the causative organism as it can be associated with extra-cardiac malignancies.
14,7,32,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial32,Title: Case Report of a 45-year-old Male with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Profile and Medical History: A 45-year-old Hispanic male with a history of tobacco use  diabetes mellitus type-2  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension was admitted to our medical facility. He has had no previous surgeries or known allergies.  Presenting Complaints: The patient presented with a three-week history of persistent fever  lethargy  and pronounced weight loss.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.8°C  heart rate of 102 beats per minute  blood pressure of 120/85 mm Hg  and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Cardiac auscultation elucidated a new murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation. The patient also had multiple petechiae on his lower extremities and palpable spleen.  Diagnostic Assessments: A complete blood count indicated leukocytosis and anemia. Blood culture grew Staphylococcus aureus. Chest radiograph was unremarkable while the electrocardiogram indicated left ventricular hypertrophy but no changes suggestive of acute ischemia.   Trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed the presence of a vegetation on the atrial side of the mitral valve leaflet  consistent with infective endocarditis.   Patient Management and Outcome: The patient was initially managed with intravenous antibiotic therapy including ceftriaxone and gentamicin. Due to continuing fever and bacteremia despite adequate antibiotic therapy for five days  and considering the size of vegetation on the valve  surgical evaluation was sought.   Upon evaluation  patient underwent surgical debridement and mitral valve replacement. The post-operative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged on prolonged antibiotics with regular follow-up appointments and blood cultures  to ensure complete eradication of the infection.  Discussion: This case highlights the significant morbidity associated with native-valve infective endocarditis in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions. It underscores the importance of swift diagnosis and aggressive management  including surgical intervention if necessary  for improving patient outcomes.  Despite a strong treatment regime  the patient's condition mandated surgical intervention indicating that early detection plays a crucial role in decision-making and avoids complications. Delays may lead to serious consequences such as systemic emboli  heart failure  or even death.   Conclusion: Native-valve infective endocarditis can lead to severe complications and high mortality rates. Therefore  clinicians should maintain a high degree of suspicion and promptly start appropriate management. This case also emphasizes the importance of periodic evaluation and patient education  especially among those with underlying cardiovascular diseases.
14,7,33,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial33,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 63-Year-Old Male: A Case Report   Patient Description:  We present a case of a 63-year-old Caucasian male patient who was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis (IE). The patient was a non-smoker and reported moderate alcohol consumption. He had no family history of cardiovascular disease or infection-related diseases.   Past Medical History:  The patient's past medical history comprised hypertension (HTN) diagnosed 10 years ago  well-controlled on therapy with amlodipine 5 mg daily. He was also under treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for the last seven years  using metformin 1000 mg twice daily. No other significant medical history was noted.  Case Presentation:  The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of fever  fatigue  and exertional dyspnea of two weeks' duration. Additionally  he reported unintentional weight loss of about 10 lbs over the last month. He had no known allergies. On examination  he was febrile (38.5 °C) and exhibited a heart rate of 98 beats per minute. Blood pressure was 132/84 mmHg. Cardiovascular examination revealed a new-onset murmur at the apex  heard best at end-diastole with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  An initial blood culture revealed the growth of Streptococcus viridans. An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated sinus rhythm without any acute ischemic changes. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed presence of a mitral valve vegetation measuring 1.5 cm  satisfying the echocardiographic criteria for definite IE according to the modified Duke's criteria.  A diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) was made.  Treatment and Follow-up:  The patient was initiated on IV penicillin G and gentamicin  in line with the American Heart Association's (AHA) treatment guidelines for IE due to streptococci. Anticoagulation therapy remained withheld in fear of embolic events from the large vegetation. Despite aggressive medical therapy  his clinical status deteriorated and he developed severe mitral regurgitation  leading to decompensated heart failure. The case was re-evaluated by a multidisciplinary team  and a decision was made for surgical management. The patient underwent successful mitral valve replacement with a mechanical valve.   He was discharged on lifelong anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic complications for the mechanical valve. During the six-month follow-up  the patient's condition was stable and he continued to remain asymptomatic.   Conclusions:  This case underscores the importance of early and aggressive management of community-acquired native-valve IE  including surgical intervention when required. It also highlights the significance of multidisciplinary discussions for managing complicated cases of IE.   Acknowledgement:  The patient consented to the publication of this case report and the case report was approved by the institutional ethics committee.
14,7,34,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial34,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 60-Year-Old Male with History of Rheumatic Heart Disease  Report:  Introduction:   We herein report a case of a 60-year-old male patient with an existing history of rheumatic heart disease complicated by native-valve infective endocarditis.  Clinical Information:  The patient  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  presented in the Emergency Department with the chief complaint of fever  chills  malaise  and body aches for the past one week. He also reported experiencing a shortness of breath  orthopnea  and weight loss  but denied any chest pains  palpitations  or syncope. His past medical history revealed long-standing rheumatic heart disease  with preserved systolic function reported in his last echocardiogram.  On examination  the patient was febrile (38.6°C)  with a heart rate of 96 beats per minute  and blood pressure measured at 130/80 mmHg. Cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur at the apex. Current medications included warfarin for stroke prevention  lisinopril for blood pressure control  and aspirin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.  Investigations:  Blood tests demonstrated elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and anemia (hemoglobin 10.1 g/dl). Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no ST or T wave changes. Blood cultures isolated Streptococcus viridans; however  no vegetation was detected at transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). Serologic tests were negative for rheumatoid factor and anti-nuclear antibodies  ruling out connective tissue diseases.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was diagnosed with definite infective endocarditis based on clinical  microbiological  echocardiography results and Duke's criteria. He was started on intravenous (IV) antibiotics  specifically ceftriaxone and gentamycin for a total of 6 weeks. Regular follow-ups after completion of IV antibiotic therapy showed significant improvements in his symptoms and inflammatory markers. The patient was eventually transferred to a rehabilitative unit due to ongoing weakness and anemia.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of a high degree of suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients with pre-existing heart disease and the benefits of early treatment initiation. As healthcare professionals  we need to incorporate an aggressive approach to patients with rheumatic heart disease who present with unexplained symptoms  such as fever or changes in murmur  to limit and prevent lethal complications of infective endocarditis.

He is not on regular anticoagulation  and he follows a Mediterranean diet. He has no known allergies to drugs. The patient lives in a suburban area with his wife. He reported no recent travels or unusual food intake.  Clinical Findings:  The patient was presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of malaise  night sweats  and a recently developed shortness of breath. There was no history of chest pain  cough or orthopnea. Physical examination showed mild pallor  blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg  irregular pulse of 100 bpm  and a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius. Cardiac examination revealed a grade 3 systolic murmur. No peripheral signs of infective endocarditis were found.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Laboratory tests revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 15 000 cells/mm3  and raised C-hs reactive protein levels at 60 mg/L. His HbA1C was 7.3 %. His renal function was normal. An electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial fibrillation. An echocardiogram showed vegetation in the mitral valve with severe mitral regurgitation and no signs of abscess or other complications. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  confirming the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis. The patient was negative for HIV  HCV  and HBV.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was admitted to the cardiology department and intravenous antibiotics were commenced (Penicillin G)  alongside subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) for the atrial fibrillation.  Outcome:  The patient's general condition improved over the following 4 days with a reduction in fever and general malaise. Repeat echocardiogram completed after 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy showed reduction in vegetation size. However  the severity of the mitral regurgitation persisted  and the patient was referred for surgical consultation.  Follow-up:  A successful mitral valve replacement was performed 5 weeks after the initial presentation. At a subsequent follow-up visit 6 weeks postoperatively  the patient reported feeling well with resolution of his symptoms. His INR on warfarin was within the therapeutic range.  Conclusion:  The presented case underlines the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients presenting with non-specific symptoms particularly when concurrent signs of new murmurs or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation are present.

14,7,36,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial36,Abstract:  The following is a case report about Mr. X  a 62-year-old male patient who presented with signs of native-valve infective endocarditis. The report contains detailed demographic data  a full medical history  and a review of the diagnosis  treatment  and follow-up associated with this disease.  Case Presentation:  Mr. X is a 62-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He lives in a suburban area and is a retired school teacher. He has moderate alcohol use and does not use tobacco or illicit drugs.   He presented at the hospital with complaints of a high fever  severe fatigue  weight loss  and occasional breathlessness for about two weeks. He also had a non-productive cough and intermittent chest pain  particularly on the left side. In addition  he had developed a few  non-itchy  red spots on the palms and soles  recognized as Janeway lesions.  Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  the patient exhibited a low-grade fever (38.1°C) and moderate systolic murmur (3/6). He was slightly dyspneic at rest. Blood pressure was 142/88 mmHg  and pulse was regular at 88/min. The patient showed finger clubbing  Osler nodes on fingers  and Janeway Lesions on palms.  Laboratory Findings:  Blood investigations showed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)  whereas white blood cell (WBC) count was within normal limits. Hemoglobin and platelet levels were marginally low. Blood cultures demonstrated Staphylococcus aureus growth  suggestive of bacteremia. The patient also had increased glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) attributable to type 2 diabetes.   Imaging:  A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was done which showed an oscillating intracardiac mass on a native valve consistent with vegetations confirming the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis.   Management:  Mr. X was admitted to the hospital and immediately started on high-dose intravenous antibiotics (Vancomycin and Gentamycin) based on sensitivity of S.aureus to these drugs from the blood culture report. His blood sugar was managed by giving insulin. Follow-up blood culture reports showed a decrease in S. aureus load over the next two weeks  indicating a positive response to the treatment. Close monitoring of renal function was maintained due to risk of nephrotoxicity from the antibiotics.   Outcome:  Mr. X was hospitalised for six weeks  during which he clinically improved  and his inflammatory markers gradually returned to normal. Repeat echocardiograms showed decreasing size of vegetations and no new cardiac complications. After deescalation to oral antibiotics  he was discharged with recommendations for regular follow-up and instructions regarding strict glycemic control and continuing the oral antibiotics for several weeks.  Summary:  This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of native valve infective endocarditis  particularly in patients with a prior history of diseases like diabetes. Rapid initiation of antibiotic therapy can significantly decrease morbidity and improve outcomes in such patients. 
14,7,37,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial37,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Aging Male Patient with Diabetes Mellitus and History of Alcohol Abuse.  Case Report:  Patient Information:   We report the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian male who presented to our hospital complaining of a two-week history of fever  fatigue  and malaise.  Medical History:  The patient has a known medical history of type II diabetes mellitus  which had been under poor control with recent HbA1c values persistently above 9.0%. His medical history also entails chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  uncontrolled hypertension  and chronic alcoholism which he admitted to quit just two years ago. He denied ever using intravenous drugs or having any history of rheumatic heart disease  valvular heart disease  or any other underlying heart conditions. He has had no previous surgical history or relevant familial history of any cardiovascular diseases. Additionally  on social history  he was a lifelong non-smoker.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  he appeared unwell with a temperature of 38.8°C. Cardiovascular examination revealed a new systolic murmur best heard at the apex of the heart. His blood pressure was 135/85 mmHg  his pulse rate was 88 beats per minute and regular  and his respiration rate was 18 breaths per minute. No peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis were found.  Diagnostic Assessments:  Laboratory investigations showed elevated levels of inflammation markers with a white cell count (WCC) of 13.0 x 109/L and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 114 mg/L. His random blood sugar level on admission was 312 mg/dL and HbA1c was 9.5%.  Three blood cultures were collected in 24 hours  all of which grew Gram-positive cocci  identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Chest X-ray was normal  while echocardiography confirmed the presence of a vegetation on the mitral valve  with no significant regurgitation and preserved ejection fraction.   Therapeutic Interventions:  The patient was diagnosed with infective endocarditis based on Duke's criteria and promptly started on treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin per Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. He was also managed for his diabetes  hypertension  and COPD.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  On a fortnight from his admission  the patient condition significantly improved. The repeat echocardiogram after four weeks of therapy showed a reduction in vegetation size. The patient is currently in the outpatient setting for continuation of antibiotics as his infectious disease management.  Conclusions:   This case amplifies the fact that patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and a history of alcohol abuse could be susceptible to native-valve infective endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus. Early detection and effective medical intervention can lead to a positive clinical outcome.

On initial examination  her vital signs were as follows: temperature  38.3ºC; blood pressure  120/85 mm Hg; heart rate  90 bpm; respiratory rate  20/minute; and oxygen saturation  96% on room air. Physical examination revealed conjunctival pallor and a newly appreciated systolic murmur best heard at the apex. No subcutaneous nodules  digital clubbing  or Osler’s nodes were observed. A complete blood count demonstrated moderate normocytic anemia and leukocytosis with left shift. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels were elevated.  Given her persistent fever and new cardiac murmur in conjunction with her systemic symptoms  a diagnosis of infective endocarditis was considered. Blood cultures were drawn  and the patient was empirically started on intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin.  Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a mobile vegetation (15 mm x 10 mm) on the atrial side of the mitral valve without significant mitral regurgitation. Following echocardiography results and Duke Criteria  a definitive diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made. Blood cultures later grew Streptococcus viridans.  Given the patient's diagnosis  her rheumatoid arthritis medications (methotrexate and corticosteroids) were temporarily withheld. Her antibiotic therapy was adjusted according to the sensitivity of the cultured organism  shifted to ceftriaxone for a total of 4 weeks. Repeat blood cultures after two weeks of antibiotic therapy were negative.  Conclusion:  The patient responded well to the treatment  with the resolution of her fever and systemic symptoms. No surgical intervention was required  as there was no evidence of heart failure  uncontrolled infection  or persistent vegetation after appropriate antibiotic therapy. She was referred back to her rheumatologist for the management of her rheumatoid arthritis  with the recommendation for close follow-up given her increased risk of future endocarditis.  This case underscores the need for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients presenting with systemic symptoms  especially those with predisposing conditions such as autoimmune diseases or immunosuppression. Early recognition and prompt initiation of treatment are critical in preventing potential fatal systemic complications.

Her past medical history included type II diabetes mellitus  diagnosed ten years prior  with inconsistent management due to medication nonadherence. She also reported a 20-pack-year smoking history and occasional alcohol use. She has not undergone any recent dental or invasive procedures. She had no known history of drug abuse and did not have any recorded previous heart problems.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed visible weight loss and pallor. Her vitals showed mild tachycardia at 108 bpm  with a blood pressure of 120/90 mmHg. Cardiovascular examination identified a diastolic blowing murmur best heard along the left sternal border. There were no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis visible. The rest of the general and systemic examinations were unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment: Complete blood count showed anemia of chronic disease and raised leukocyte counts. Fasting and postprandial glucose levels were above the normal range. Blood cultures grown demonstrated the presence of Streptococcus viridans  suggesting bacteremia. Echocardiogram showed a mobile  oscillating mass attached to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve  suggesting vegetation  alongside mitral regurgitation. This confirmed the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Therapeutic Intervention: Based on her clinical status and the sensitivity pattern of the bacteria isolated  Ms. A was started on intravenous ceftriaxone (2g daily) and gentamicin (1 mg/kg thrice daily) for a period of 6 weeks. Regular blood glucose monitoring was done  and her diabetic therapy was adjusted accordingly with Insulin due to her increased glucose levels. She was recommended to quit smoking and to limit her alcohol consumption.  Follow-up and Outcomes: On serial follow-ups  she showed a gradual symptomatic improvement. Repeated blood cultures after two weeks of antibiotic therapy came out sterile. Follow-up echocardiography at six weeks revealed significant reduction of the vegetation size. She was encouraged to adhere to her diabetic medications and was referred for tobacco cessation counseling.  Patient Perspective: Ms. A expressed gratitude towards her healthcare team for the comprehensive and thorough management of her condition. She is motivated to maintain her health  control her blood glucose levels  and give up smoking.  Discussion: This case emphasizes the importance of considering infective endocarditis in patients presenting with unexplained fever  especially with a history of predisposing factors such as poorly controlled diabetes. It underlines the necessity of timely intervention to prevent further complications and also draws attention to the need of patient education for adherence to therapy  lifestyle modifications  and regular follow-ups.

Social History: He is a retired truck driver  lives with his wife  has two adult children  and four grandchildren. His alcohol consumption is moderate and within recommended limits.   Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.2°C  blood pressure of 110/75 mmHg  pulse rate of 103 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. Clinical examination demonstrated an ill-looking male with peripheral cyanosis and finger clubbing. Cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. Other signs such as splinter hemorrhages or Roth spots were not evident.  Diagnostic Assessment: Laboratory results showed leukocytosis of 16 000 with 80% neutrophils  erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 110 mm/hr  C-reactive protein of 98 mg/L  and elevated blood urea nitrogen & creatinine suggesting renal impairment. Liver enzymes and electrolytes were normal. Chest radiography was consistent with previous documentation of COPD and did not show any pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. ECG was normal without any ischemic changes or signs of pericarditis.  An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a large  mobile echodensity attached to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve with moderate mitral regurgitation suggestive of vegetation and possible infective endocarditis (IE).   Blood cultures taken at the time of admission subsequently grew Staphylococcus aureus  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE).  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was started empirically on intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone after obtaining blood cultures at presentation. After confirming the blood culture results  the antibiotic was switched to Nafcillin and Gentamicin based on susceptibility testing. Infectious disease service was consulted and they advised continuing antibiotic therapy for six weeks. Cardiac surgery was consulted but they decided to defer surgical intervention due to ongoing infection.  Follow-Up: The patient showed steady improvement with the resolution of fever and decrease in leukocytosis over the following days. He completed 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy and was discharged home. Repeat blood cultures at the completion of therapy were negative and repeat echocardiography showed a reduction in vegetation size. His renal function gradually returned to normal.

14,7,42,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial42,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Diabetic Patient: A Case Report   Patient Information:  Patient: Mr. A Age: 75 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired   Clinical History:  Mr. A has a documented history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for approximately 20 years. Other significant past medical history includes moderate hypertension and hyperlipidemia  all of which are managed with oral medication. The patient has been compliant with his medications and regular follow-ups.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. A presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of fatigue  less appetite  low-grade fever  chills  and a new onset of a systolic murmur over the left lower sternal border. He had previously been treated with oral antibiotics from a local clinic for a presumed respiratory tract infection  but the symptoms persisted.   Clinical Findings:  On examination  he was febrile with a temperature of 38.3 Celsius. His other vital signs were within normal ranges. The cardiac examination revealed a grade 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. No other abnormalities were noted on physical examination  and he did not exhibit any peripheral signs of endocarditis such as petechiae  Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions.   Diagnostic Assessment:  Blood cultures were drawn and sent to the microbiology laboratory. Whilst awaiting results  he was admitted to the hospital and put on empirical antibiotic therapy.  His echocardiogram showed a 1.5cm vegetation on the aortic valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Laboratory findings were significant for mild leukocytosis and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Blood cultures later grew Streptococcus viridans  which proved to be sensitive to penicillin.   Therapeutic Intervention:  Mr. A was started on intravenous Penicillin G  3 million units every 4 hours for 6 weeks as per the sensitivity report. The patient's fever gradually subsided  and his general health improved over the next week.  Follow-up and Outcome:  During his follow-up  his clinical symptoms were completely resolved. A repeat blood culture at the end of treatment was negative  and follow-up echocardiogram showed a resolution of the valvular vegetation.   Learning Points:  This case illustrates the importance of comprehensive history taking  and early suspicion of infective endocarditis in patients with persistent fever and identification of new murmurs. Timely intervention and guideline-based antimicrobial therapy can result in a satisfactory outcome even in high-risk patients. Even so  more effort is needed in the prevention and control of risk factors that may potentiate heart valve infections  such as quality diabetic control.

Patient profile: The patient is a 62-year-old male  Caucasian  retired mechanic with a history of moderate smoking and social alcohol drinking. His initial profession apparently exposed him to potential sources of bacterial contamination. He lives with his wife  has no children  and denies any illicit drug use. There is a significant family history of cardiac diseases. The patient has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hypercholesterolemia.  Initial Presentation: The patient reported a 2-month history of episodic fever and chills  fatigue  mild shortness of breath  and an unintentional weight loss of 10 lbs over a month. His regular medications include metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient appeared chronically ill. His body mass index (BMI) was 28  temperature was 100.4 F  blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg  heart rate 88 beats per minute  respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a diastolic murmur in left lower sternal border and an increased intensity of P2. Abdominal and genital examination did not show any unusual sign. He had no visible skin lesions  and neurological examination was normal.  Investigation Findings: A complete blood count showed mild leukocytosis and mild anemia. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus bovis. Electrocardiogram showed non-specific ST-T wave changes. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and later transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) demonstrated a large vegetation on the mitral valve along with severe mitral regurgitation. Besides  there was evidence of pulmonary hypertension.  Diagnosis and Management: The patient was diagnosed with Native-valve Infective Endocarditis (NVE). Initially  he was started on intravenous penicillin G and gentamicin  according to the sensitivity of the isolated bacteria. His fever started to subside after 5-day of antibiotic treatment. After a detailed discussion with the patient and his family about potential risks and benefits  surgical intervention was agreed upon to control the infection  which included mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve. The postoperative period went uneventful. The patient was eventually discharged on a 6-week course of antibiotic therapy.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of early detection  timely medical  and possibly surgical intervention in patients with NVE. It also signifies the common association of Streptococcus bovis  a constituent of gut flora  with endocarditis  marking the need for gastrointestinal evaluation for possible lesions in these patients.
14,7,44,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial44,Title: An Unusual Presentation of Streptococcus viridans Infective Endocarditis in a Native Valve  Introduction:  Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare but severe infection of the endocardial surface of the heart  which can predominantly affect native as well as prosthetic valves. We present a case of native-valve Streptococcus viridans infective endocarditis in a middle-aged woman with no prior cardiac history.  Case Presentation:  A 62-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a three-week history of worsening fatigue  loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 kilograms. The patient also reported experiencing episodes of low-grade fever and night sweats but no other significant symptoms. There was no known drug or alcohol abuse  and her personal and social history were non-contributory.  Past medical history  including cardiovascular history  was unremarkable. She was on no medications and had no known drug allergies. She had recent dental procedure two months ago without any antibiotic prophylaxis.  On physical examination  she was febrile (temperature 38.5°C)  with blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg  heart rate 98 bpm  and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Cardiac examination found an early diastolic murmur heard best in the fifth intercostal space along the right sternal border. Fundoscopic examination showed Roth spots  and there were splinter hemorrhages present in the nail beds. These clinical signs were suggestive of infective endocarditis.   Laboratory findings showed elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate 60 mm/hr  C-reactive protein 110 mg/l)  normocytic anemia  and elevated urea and creatinine levels but normal liver function tests. Blood cultures were drawn  resulting positive for Streptococcus viridans. Transeosophageal echocardiography revealed vegetations on the mitral valve consistent with native valve endocarditis.  The patient was admitted to the hospital  where she received a four-week treatment course of intravenous penicillin G and gentamicin. Subsequent blood cultures showed eradication of the organism after 2 weeks. Her clinical status improved significantly over the course of treatment.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of careful examination and recognition of clinical signs of infective endocarditis  particularly in patients presenting with non-specific symptoms. Streptococcus viridans  a common oral flora  can lead to potentially fatal conditions following dental procedures in the absence of prophylactic antibiotics. It underlines the necessity for the dental community to adhere strictly to prophylactic antibiotic guidelines in patients at risk for infective endocarditis.

He has a known history of type II diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation; he's on oral anticoagulation.  Clinical Findings: The patient was acutely ill-appearing  and presented with a three-week history of intermittent fever  malaise  anorexia  and weight loss. He also reported recent bouts of night sweat  nonspecific arthralgias without joint swelling  and an observed heart murmur on physical examination.  Diagnostic Assessment: Elevated inflammatory markers  signs of anemia  and slightly impaired renal function were observed upon laboratory investigation. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of approximately 100/min. The chest X-ray was unremarkable. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed a 10 mm vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve and moderate regurgitation. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was commenced on high-dose intravenous antibiotics  including flucloxacillin and gentamicin  as per the local guidelines for native valve S. aureus endocarditis  with an initial plan for six weeks of therapy.  Follow-up and Outcomes: Three days into his inpatient stay  he developed dyspnea and pulmonary edema due to acute mitral regurgitation. Despite optimal medical therapy including intravenous diuretics  the condition of the patient deteriorated. A multi-disciplinary team approach was agreed for immediate surgery after considering the high surgical risks. Mitral valve repair  including debridement of the infected tissue and vegetations  was performed. The postoperative course was complicated by acute kidney injury requiring temporary hemodialysis  and by hepatocellular injury.   With intense rehabilitation  the patient gradually improved and was discharged home four weeks later. Outpatient follow-up after six months showed the patient has fully physically recovered and returned to his normal activities.  Lessons learned: This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment of infective endocarditis  which can escalate to life-threatening conditions if left untreated. The management requires a comprehensive evaluation and the combination of medical and surgical approaches in some cases.

He works as a construction labourer and lives presently with his daughter in a one-bedroom apartment. He has a history of chronic alcoholism  smoking and indigence.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient presented with two weeks of persisting high-grade fever  night sweats  malaise and a loss of appetite. His daughter mentions observing progressive lethargy and confusion in her father over this time.  Past Medical History: The patient has been struggling with alcoholism for about 25 years  drinking approximately 150 mL of whisky daily. He also admits to smoking 1 packet of cigarettes every day for the past 30 years. He had been diagnosed with mild chronic liver disease two years ago  a likely outcome of his heavy alcohol intake. Other than liver disease  his medical history is unremarkable.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient displayed symptoms of fever (38.5°C) and mild confusion. A cardiac examination revealed a harsh systolic murmur on the mitral area of the heart  suggestive of mitral regurgitation. A skin examination confirmed Janeway lesions and splinter haemorrhages. There was also evidence of paleness  poor oral hygiene  and poor nutritional status. The liver was mildly enlarged and tender on palpation.  Investigations:  The blood culture was positive for Staphylococcus aureus. An echocardiogram revealed a vegetation on the anterior leaflet of his mitral valve with moderate mitral regurgitation. Biochemical analysis revealed elevated liver enzymes with hypoalbuminemia  indicating worsening of the chronic liver disease. His chest X-ray was within normal limits.  Diagnosis and Management: The patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis  secondary to Staphylococcus aureus infection. He was immediately put on a regimen of intravenous antibiotics according to the sensitivity patterns. He further underwent a successful mitral valve replacement surgery.  Post-surgery  the patient engaged with Alcoholics Anonymous and while recovery was initially complicated by his ongoing alcohol addiction  he managed to decrease his intake substantially during the rehabilitation process. He was also referred to a nutritionist for dietary advice.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of considering infective endocarditis in any patient with persistent fevers  especially amongst those living in less-than-ideal conditions and those with pre-existing conditions such as chronic alcoholism that can lead to immunosuppression. Prompt diagnosis and intervention along with addressing concomitant social issues were crucial in managing this patient's health condition.
14,7,51,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial51,Patient Background: The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian male residing in suburban New York. He is employed as an accountant. The patient has a history of moderate alcohol use but is a non-smoker and does not use illicit drugs. His medical history reveals he suffers from type II diabetes and hypertension and underwent left knee replacement surgery two years ago. There is no history of any known congenital heart defects  rheumatic heart disease  or any previous heart surgeries.  Presenting symptoms: The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of high-grade fever  fatigue  weight loss  and shortness of breath. The symptoms occurred intermittently for three weeks prior to admission. The fever was associated with chills and night sweats. He also reported a decreased appetite and a weight loss of approximately 8 pounds in this period.  Examination and Diagnosis: Upon physical examination  the patient demonstrated signs of peripheral embolic phenomena  including petechiae in the conjunctiva and oral mucosa  as well as Osler's nodes on the fingers and toes. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation.   Blood cultures were done  and after 48 hours  they showed the growth of Streptococcus viridans  indicative of bacterial endocarditis. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed  which revealed large vegetations on the leaflets of the aortic valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management and Course: The patient was started on intravenous treatment with penicillin G and gentamicin in accordance with the hospital's endocarditis treatment guideline. Blood glucose and blood pressure were periodically monitored and managed with appropriate medications.   At the end of 4 weeks of treatment  the symptoms had largely resolved  blood cultures remained negative  and follow-up echocardiography showed significant reduction in vegetations. No complications related to congestive heart failure or systemic emboli were observed during the hospital stay. It was recommended to the patient to have regular follow-ups to monitor his condition.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of early recognition and treatment of infective endocarditis in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms  such as fever and weight loss  particularly in the presence of predisposing factors like diabetes and hypertension.    Comment: Despite being less commonly associated with injective drug use  infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans involving native valves is not uncommon and remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Awareness  early diagnosis  and prompt effective treatment are crucial for a better prognosis.
14,7,52,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial52,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Female  Case Report:  A 55-year-old Caucasian female presented to our Department of Cardiology with a one week history of low-grade fever  fatigue  malaise  night sweats  and weight loss. Her past medical history was unremarkable aside from mild hypertension  for which she took Amlodipine 5 mg daily  and occasional migraines.  She was a school teacher by profession  denied any use of tobacco or illicit drugs  and had no known exposure to intravenous drug users. Her family history was significant for coronary artery disease  in her father  who had a myocardial infarction in his late sixties. She did not have a history of any dental procedures or invasive procedures in the last 6 months.  On examination  her blood pressure was slightly elevated at 140/80 mmHg  with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and a temperature of 38.2°C. Her cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur in the aortic area. There were no signs of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.  Laboratory investigations indicated a raised white cell count of 14 000/µl with a predominance of neutrophils. Her hemoglobin and platelet counts were normal. Significant for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 50 mm/hr and C-reactive protein was 80 mg/L. Blood cultures drawn were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. An echocardiogram revealed vegetations on the patient’s native aortic valve  and mild aortic regurgitation.  Given the patient's clinical manifestations  the vegetations detected on the aortic valve in the echocardiography  and the positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus  we diagnosed the patient with native-valve infective endocarditis.  She was immediately started on an empiric antibiotic therapy with IV Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone. She was hospitalized and monitored for any signs of congestive heart failure  embolic events  and arrhythmias.   Discussion:   This case highlights that a diagnosis of infective endocarditis  albeit an uncommon condition  should be entertained in patients presenting with consistent clinical signs and symptoms even in the absence of known risk factors such as intravascular device  immunosuppression  recent dental or invasive procedures. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential in the management to prevent severe complications like cardiac failure  embolic events  or even death.  This case also emphasizes the need for clinicians to always consider the possibility of a native-valve endocarditis in patients presenting with fever and other constitutional symptoms  even in those with a seemingly innocuous medical history. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management are paramount to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with this potentially lethal condition.
14,7,53,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial53,Title: Infective Endocarditis in a Native-Valve Setting: A Case Report   Patient Information:  The patient was a 67-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the hospital with a three-week history of persisting fever and weakness. He was a retired engineer  non-smoker  had occasional alcohol intake and was active in community fundraising activities. He was married and had two children. He had no known drug allergies.  The patient had a past medical history of hypertension  for which he had been taking an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker for six years. He had type-2 diabetes mellitus  controlled with metformin for five years. He also had a history of severe Diverticulosis five years ago that was managed conservatively with dietary modifications. He had no known history of heart disease or any other significant illness.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed a fever of 38.5 degrees Celsius  blood pressure of 135/80 mmHg  a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and heart rate of 100 beats per minute. Clinical cardiac examination showed a grade III/VI holistic pansystolic murmur best heard at the apex. There were no signs of peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis (IE).   Diagnostic Assessment:  Complete blood count showed raised levels of leukocytes suggestive of an infectious process. Blood cultures were drawn and repeated after 12 hours. While awaited the culture result  the patient underwent an echocardiographic examination  which revealed large echogenic masses attached to the mitral valve  consistent with vegetations in native valves  supporting a diagnosis of native valve IE.   The patient’s blood culture confirmed the presence of Streptococcus agalactiae sensitive to Penicillin and Amoxicillin.   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was started on intravenous Amoxicillin as per sensitivity results. Alongside  he continued to take his antihypertensive medications and metformin for his underlying conditions.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  The patient responded well to treatment; his symptoms improved significantly over the following week  and follow-up blood cultures showed no growth. A follow-up echocardiography after four weeks showed a significant reduction in vegetation size.   Conclusion:  Native valve infective endocarditis  though less common than prosthetic valve IE  can present without overt clinical signs. High clinical suspicion  swift diagnosis with echocardiography  and timely management can result in successful patient outcomes.

Patient History:  The patient's past medical history reveals that he is a non-smoker  with moderate alcohol consumption habits. He has well-controlled Type II diabetes mellitus  for which he takes Metformin  and suffers from hyperlipidemia  which is managed with Atorvastatin. There is also a history of hypertension  treated with Lisinopril.   The patient has a prior history of gout  which flares up occasionally  but is generally controlled with Colchicine. There are no previously noted cardiac abnormalities. He has no known drug allergies and familial risk factors include his paternal history indicating myocardial infarction  a brother with early-onset diabetes  and an older sister who passed due to stroke.  Presenting Complications:  Upon arrival  the patient complained of heart palpitations  night sweats  fever  and shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He expressed considerable weight loss (8 lbs in two weeks) amid loss of appetite and also indicated intermittent low-grade fever. Physical examination revealed an ill-appearing male patient with oral temperature of 100.2°F  blood pressure of 120/78 mm Hg  pulse rate of 101 bpm  and sporadic heart murmur.   Investigative Actions:  Suspecting infective endocarditis (IE)  the attending physician ordered a two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and blood cultures. Interim blood work showed neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis and mildly elevated creatinine level (1.4 mg/dL) suggesting possible acute kidney injury secondary to systemic infection. Other lab values included elevated ESR and CRP  suggesting an inflammatory process.   The TTE revealed the presence of vegetations on the native mitral valve leading to mild mitral insufficiency  and blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus  consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management:  The patient was admitted to the hospital for further management and began empiric antibiotic therapy. In light of severity of the infection and ongoing systemic symptoms  the patient was started on intravenous treatment with Oxacillin and Gentamicin. Cardiac surgery was consulted regarding possible valve replacement.  Outcome:  After a total of six weeks of inpatient treatment  the patient's infection showed considerable improvement. Symptoms including fever  night sweats and palpitations had greatly subsided. Follow-up TTE revealed decreased vegetation size. Post-treatment labs showed adequate kidney function and the patient was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. The cardiac surgery team recommended continued monitoring of the mitral valve without immediate need for surgical intervention.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the requirement for high clinical suspicion for native-valve IE in patients with new-onset heart murmurs combined with systemic signs of infection. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management with antibiotic therapy can yield positive outcomes  even in high-risk patients with comorbidities.

Here  we present a case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (IE) in a previously healthy adolescent female.   Case Presentation: The patient is a 15-year-old Hispanic female with no significant past medical history  who initially presented to the emergency department with a high-grade fever of 39.4 degrees Celsius (103°F)  malaise  and generalized fatigue of a week's duration.  The patient denied nausea  vomiting  chest pain  difficulty in breathing  or any urinary or bowel complaints. No history of illicit drug use was reported. Family history was non-contributory with no history of rheumatic heart disease or any congenital heart abnormalities. Prior to the onset of her symptoms  she was a high school student with good academic standing and was particularly active in sports.   On physical examination  the patient appeared ill and was in moderate distress due to fever. Examination of the cardiovascular system revealed a grade III/VI systolic murmur in the mitral region. No conjunctival pallor  peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis  or other systemic findings related to vasculitis were found. Initial vital signs showed tachycardia and low-grade fever which prompted further investigations.  Investigations: Lab reports showed a negative rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody. However  there was a significant elevation in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (74 mm/hr) and C reactive protein (90 mg/L). Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus  confirming a bacterial infection.  A Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) was performed which indicated vegetations on the mitral valve  indicating Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis (IE). The patient was further investigated with Chest X-ray and EKG  which revealed no abnormalities.  Treatment/Management: The patient was started on empiric therapy with Vancomycin and Gentamycin. Upon the identification of Staphylococcus aureus from blood cultures  therapy was deescalated and the patient was switched to a regimen of Nafcillin and Gentamycin.   The patient responded well to treatment with the resolution of her symptoms. On serial echocardiograms  the vegetations on the mitral valve were seen to be resolving. She was then discharged after 4 weeks with oral antibiotics  and a follow-up appointment in the outpatient department.  Discussion: This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining high clinical suspicion for Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in febrile patients with cardiovascular signs  even in the absence of predisposing heart conditions or risk factors. Timely diagnosis and treatment were pivotal in the successful outcome achieved for this patient.  Conclusions: Infective endocarditis  although rare  can occur in healthy adolescents. High clinical suspicion and early intervention play a key role in management and result in better patient outcomes.

14,7,61,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial61,Title: A Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Patient with a History of Intravenous Drug Use  Background: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare but life-threatening infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. It predominantly affects individuals with pre-existing heart diseases  specifically valve diseases  or those who inject drugs. This case report presents the history  clinical manifestations  diagnosis  treatment  and prognosis of a patient with native-valve IE.  Case Presentation:  Mr. X  a 50-year-old Caucasian male  was referred to our emergency department with severe shortness of breath  intermittent fever  weakness  and unexplained weight loss for the past month. He was a chronic smoker and reported history of intravenous drug use  mainly heroin  but has been abstinent for the past five years.  On examination  his blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg  heart rate 102 bpm  respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed a murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation. No peripheral stigmata of IE were noticed.  Investigations:  We proceeded with transthoracic echocardiography which showed an oscillating intracardiac mass on a native cardiac valve  supporting the diagnosis of IE. Our suspicions were strengthened by the presence of one of the Duke's major criteria (positive echo) and two of the minor criteria (fever and predisposing heart condition or use of intravenous drug use).  Blood cultures were collected and sent to the lab. They grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. The septic screen was positive  and the WBC count  ESR  and CRP were also elevated  indicating ongoing systemic infection.  Management:  Immediately after aerobic blood culture results were available  the patient was started on intravenous Nafcillin as per the guidelines. Along with medical management  the patient was assessed and monitored for any indication for surgical interventions. He was also referred to a specialized drug rehabilitation center for relapse prevention and psychological support.  Outcome and Follow-up:  The patient showed significant progress over the course of two weeks with reduction in fever  breathlessness  and general symptoms. After six weeks of antibiotic therapy  a follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram was performed  showing complete resolution of the vegetation. He was further advised for rigorous follow-up  healthy lifestyle changes  and cessation of smoking.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of in-depth understanding and suspicion of IE in patients with compatible clinical symptoms and history of intravenous drug use. Timely diagnosis and prompt intervention can significantly improve the prognosis in such patients. A multidisciplinary approach involving cardiology  infectious diseases  and addiction medicine departments is crucial in managing these patients.

Patient Information:  The patient is a Caucasian male  57-year-old  who is a non-smoker and moderate alcohol consumer. He works as a construction engineer and has no history of illicit drug use. His past medical history includes controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia  for which he has been taking antihypertensive (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors) and statin medications respectively. There is no familial history of heart disease. He has no history of allergy or immunodeficiency  and he is up-to-date with his immunizations. There is no recent history of dental procedures or surgeries.  Clinical Findings:  The patient complained of flu-like symptoms including low-grade fever  fatigue  night sweats  muscle discomfort  and unexplained weight loss for the past three weeks. He also reported experiencing chest discomfort  breathlessness  and a new heart murmur was noticed  which had not been recorded in his previous health checks.  Diagnostic Assessment:  A series of investigations were conducted  including blood tests  which revealed elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP). Blood culture was positive for Staphylococcus aureus  confirming our suspicion for infective endocarditis. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed  which demonstrated vegetations on the patient's native aortic valves confirming native valve endocarditis. Subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed to assess the severity and involvement of other cardiac structures.  Pathological Findings:  Gross pathological findings revealed large vegetations on the leaflets of the aortic valve. The valve was thickened and showed signs of severe inflammation  consistent with bacterial endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus.  Treatment:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous antibiotic therapy with flucloxacillin  following standard treatment protocols for native-valve infective endocarditis caused by Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.  Outcome and Follow-up:  There was significant improvement in the patient's symptoms after two weeks of antibiotic therapy. Repeated cultures revealed no growth  indicating the successful eradication of bacteria. However  due to the substantial damage to the aortic valve  the patient was referred for valve replacement surgery. Post-surgery  the patient demonstrated remission of symptoms and complete recovery in the cardiac function. Follow-ups six months after discharge showed no recurrence of infective endocarditis.   Discussion:  This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment of infective endocarditis. It underlines the need for high clinical suspicion in patients presenting with persistent flu-like symptoms and new heart murmurs  specifically in patients with prior cardiac conditions. Further  it emphasizes the importance of comprehensive management  including antibiotic therapy and  if necessary  surgical intervention to achieve optimal patient outcomes. 
14,7,63,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial63,"Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 60-year-old Male with a History of Intravenous Drug Use: A Case Report  Patient Information and Clinical Findings: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male presented with flu-like symptoms. His main complaints were a two-week history of persistent fever  rigors  malaise  night sweats  anorexia  and weight loss. From the physical examination  the patient was found to be febrile (temperature recorded at 38.8℃) and tachycardic with mild tachypnea. Examination revealed a diastolic murmur on the left side of the sternal edge suggesting possible aortic regurgitation. No peripheral signs of endocarditis were noted.  Medical  Family  and Social History: The patient's past medical history included fibromyalgia and hepatitis C (presumed secondary to past intravenous drug use)  for which he was receiving non-interferon-based antiviral therapy. The patient had a history of psychiatric illness with multiple depressive episodes and had undergone treatment for opioid addiction. He had been abstinent from all substances for the past 10 years. Ethnicity and family history were unremarkable for cardiac or metabolic disease. The patient lived alone and had been unemployed for many years.  Diagnostic Assessment: Blood cultures were subsequently drawn  which isolated Staphylococcus aureus. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed aortic valve endocarditis with severe aortic regurgitation and relatively preserved left ventricular function. These findings were confirmed with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)  which also demonstrated a large oscillating aortic vegetation.  Therapeutic Interventions:  The patient was started on intravenous cefazolin and gentamicin for empirical treatment  which was narrowed to targeted therapy with intravenous cefazolin upon blood culture results. The patient underwent an aortic valve replacement  which confirmed an infected  destructed native aortic valve.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: Postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient was discharged after 2 weeks of hospital stay with oral antibiotics for 4 weeks. Three months later  the patient was noted to have marked clinical improvement and continued to remain substance-free. Repeat echocardiogram showed a well-functioning prosthetic aortic valve with no residual regurgitation.  Patient Perspective: """"I never realized that my past could catch up with me like this. It was a wake-up call  and it scares me  but at the same time  it has strengthened my resolve to remain clean and sober.""""  This case illustrates the potential for severe sequelae of intravenous drug use  demonstrating both the typical pathogen and the more unusual presentation in the aortic rather than the tricuspid valve. It underscores the importance of a comprehensive physical examination and history taking  as well as the need to consider infective endocarditis in patients with past intravenous drug use presenting with persistent fever and a new cardiac murmur."

Medical History Mr. AB has a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus  which has been under fairly good control with Metformin for the past six years. He was also diagnosed with Rheumatic Fever at the age of 12  which caused him mild mitral valve regurgitation. The patient also has a history of chronic lower back pain treated with NSAIDs. He denies any smoking  alcohol  or illicit drug usage  and he is currently unemployed.  Clinical Findings Upon presentation  Mr. AB was febrile with a temperature of 101.3 °F (38.5 °C). Cardiac examination revealed a grade III/IV systolic murmur best heard over the left sternal border. Blood pressure was 134/86 mmHg  pulse rate 96 bpm  and respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. An initial physical exam indicated paleness of the skin (possibly suggestive of anemia)  splenomegaly  and petechiae on his extremities.  Diagnostic Assessment  An immediate complete blood count showed leukocytosis (WBC: 17 500 per dL) and anemia (Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 100 mm/hr  and CRP also elevated at 15 mg/dL  indicating infection or inflammation in the body. Blood cultures were drawn immediately and sent for analysis. A transthoracic echocardiogram was ordered  revealing thickened and vegetated mitral valve leaflets  indicative of infective endocarditis. Blood cultures returned positive after 48 hours for Streptococcus viridans.  Therapeutic Intervention Mr. AB was put on intravenous antibiotics (Penicillin G)  based on culture sensitivity results under the Infectious Disease team's guidance. He also received supplementary treatments to manage his symptoms  including antipyretics for the fever.  Follow-Up and Outcomes The patient responded well to the therapy with significant improvement in his symptoms over two weeks. His repeat blood cultures after two weeks turned out negative. The patient was discharged with instructions for a six-week course of IV Penicillin G. He was advised regular follow-ups and monitoring with the Cardiology and Infectious Disease departments  with emphasis on strict diabetes control and good oral hygiene.  Patient Perspective Mr. AB expressed relief about the improvement of his symptoms and pledged to follow his treatment regimen and scheduled medical visits seriously.

14,7,65,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial65,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Diabetic Patient  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 75-year-old Caucasian male  living in Oregon  United States  who was admitted to the hospital complaining of recurrent fever  fatigue  and shortness of breath over the last two weeks. He has experienced significant weight loss over the past month  despite no alteration in his diet.   Medical History:  The patient's medical history is notable for type 2 diabetes  managed with metformin and a dietary regimen. He was diagnosed with diabetes twenty years ago. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are also part of his medical history  controlled by hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin  respectively. He has no known family history of cardiovascular diseases. One year ago  he quit smoking  having smoked one pack per day for the past 40 years. He lives independently  doesn't drink alcohol  and has no known drug allergies.  Clinical Findings:  On clinical examination  he was found to be febrile (38.5°C)  with a pulse rate of 96 beats/minute  blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg  respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute  and SpO2 of 92% in room air. Cardiac examination revealed a new murmur  suggestive of aortic regurgitation. Blood tests showed elevated inflammatory markers including ESR and CRP. Blood cultures came back positive for Staphylococcus aureus.  Diagnostic Assessment:  The diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was confirmed with transesophageal echocardiography  which showed a predominant vegetation on the aortic valve leaflet. His glomerular filtration rate was below the normal value  indicating compromised renal function.  Therapeutic Intervention:  He was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and ceftriaxone as per IDSA guidelines  pending culture sensitivity results. His blood sugar was optimally controlled to avoid any further risk. Given his age and comorbidities  the cardiothoracic team recommended against surgical intervention at this stage.  Outcome and Follow-up:  The patient's symptoms improved significantly over the course of two weeks. His renal function tests improved  but did not return to fully normal. Given the nature of his bacteremia and resulting endocarditis  a prolonged course of antibiotics was continued for six weeks. The patient was discharged with close follow-up instructions for cardiology  infectious disease  and primary care.   Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of early recognition and prompt management of infective endocarditis  particularly in patients with risk factors such as diabetes. It underscores the role of long-term antibiotic therapy  optimal control of comorbid conditions  and careful follow-up in these complex patients. It also stresses the need for healthcare providers to keep a high index of suspicion among elderly patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms like fever and fatigue.

14,7,67,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial67,Patient Information  Initials: T.J. Age: 67 years old  Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired   Chief Complaint  The patient presented with fatigue  fever  and night sweats inflicted for two weeks.  History of Present Illness  T.J. reported an onset of intermittent  low-grade fever four weeks ago which has been consistent for the past two weeks. He also described general weakness and fatigue  night sweats  and a weight loss of approximately 10 lbs during this same period. He denied experiencing any cough  chest pain  or difficulty in breathing.   Past Medical History  T.J. has a medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus managed for the past 10 years  and hypertension controlled with medication for eight years. He also faced an incident of deep vein thrombosis five years ago. He has a 20-year history of smoking but quit two years ago. There is no record of illicit drug use or blood transfusion. He has no known drug allergies.  Examination and Tests  On physical examination  T.J. appeared pale and fatigued. His blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg  and his pulse rate was irregular at 110 bpm. He had a fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F). Cardiac auscultation revealed a new systolic murmur. An oral exam showed poor dental hygiene with some evidence of dental caries but no obvious abscesses.   Laboratory tests reported a White Blood Cell count of 13 000/uL indicative of an infection. His Hemoglobin level was 10.8 g/dL  further confirming the paleness and fatigue symptom due to mild anemia. The patient's renal function was mildly impaired (Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL; reference: 0.7-1.3 mg/dL).   Blood cultures were collected  and after 48 hours of incubation  they revealed the presence of Streptococcus viridans - a common bacterial cause of native-valve endocarditis. ECG showed signs of atrial fibrillation but didn't show any ischemic changes. An echocardiogram confirmed a mobile vegetation on the mitral valve consistent with endocarditis.  Summary  Given the patient's symptoms  medical history  and investigation results  T.J. was diagnosed with subacute native valve infective endocarditis (IE). The presence of Streptococcus viridans in the blood culture  dental caries  the murmur found on a cardiac exam  and finally  the vegetation on the mitral valve displayed via echocardiogram led to this diagnosis. Antibiotic therapy course was started immediately  with follow-up echocardiograms scheduled to monitor progress and any needed valve repair/replacement procedure.
14,7,68,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial68,Title: Immediate identification and management of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Report  Introduction:  Native valve endocarditis is an inflammatory reaction within the heart involving the native valves and often characterized by the presence of vegetations. It is typically caused by infection with various bacteria  but occasionally  viral  fungal  and protozoal agents may also be responsible.  Case Presentation:  A 65-year-old African-American male  with a known history of type-II diabetes mellitus managed with metformin  presented to the emergency department complaining of persistent fever  chills  malaise  and an unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 kilograms over the last two months. The patient also has a 10-year history of hypertension  which is controlled with amlodipine and atenolol.  Detailed physical examination revealed the presence of Roth’s spots  Osler's nodes  and Janeway lesions. A grade III diastolic murmur was heard over the aortic valve region. No previous history of valvular heart disease  congenital heart disease  or intravenous drug use was noted. The patient also denied having any dental procedures in the recent past.  Investigations:  Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis  elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate  and C-reactive protein levels. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed thickened aortic valve leaflets with mobile echo-dense vegetations on the aortic valve  suggestive of infective endocarditis. The patient was immediately admitted to the cardiology service.  Treatment:  The patient was empirically started on intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone based on the suspected presence of S. aureus. After blood culture and sensitivity results  the regimen was revised to nafcillin and gentamicin. His fever subsided after three days of antibiotics initiation.   Outcome and Follow-up:  The patient responded well to the therapy  causing the resolution of his symptoms over the next week. He completed 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy. At the 8-week follow-up after discharge  the patient remained asymptomatic. Repeat echocardiogram at this visit showed no evidence of residual vegetations or valvular dysfunction.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing the classical triad of fever  heart murmur  and vascular phenomena associated with infective endocarditis for early diagnosis. Physicians should be aware of the potential for S. aureus bacteremia  especially in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus. Early detection with prompt appropriate antimicrobial therapy can prevent serious complications  reduce morbidity and mortality  and improve patient outcomes.
14,7,69,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial69,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 58-Year-Old Caucasian Female   Introduction:  Infective Endocarditis (IE) is a serious infection of the inner layer of the heart  often affecting the heart valves. This report presents a case of a 58-year-old Caucasian female diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE).  Case Presentation:  The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian female  presenting with a two-week history of general malaise  low-grade fevers  intermittent chills  and unintentional weight loss of around 5kg over a month. She has been a non-smoker and reports moderate alcohol intake. She lives in a suburban community and is a school teacher by occupation. She has a pet cat at home but denies any scratches or bites.   Her past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  for which she takes Lisinopril and Atorvastatin respectively. Both her parents had cardiovascular disease; her father passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 65  and her mother has been living with chronic heart failure.   On examination  she appeared fatigued with a slight pallor. Her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg  heart rate of 90 bpm  respiratory rate of 18 per minute  and a temperature of 38.1-degree Celsius. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new-onset grade 4/6 systolic murmur. A full neurological examination was normal  ocular examination showed no Roth spots  and there was no splenomegaly. Further examination revealed two painless erythematous nodules on her palms and soles  consistent with Janeway lesions.   Investigations:  Complete blood count showed Hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dl  WBC count of 13.6 x10^3 /µL with 85% neutrophils. The inflammatory markers were raised with ESR of 68 mm/hr and CRP of 180 mg/L. Three sets of blood cultures were taken which later grew Staphylococcus aureus. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed a large mobile vegetation on the mitral valve with moderate mitral regurgitation.  Treatment and Outcome:  The diagnosis of NVIE was made and treatment was initiated with Intravenous Vancomycin and Gentamicin  adjusted per renal function. The patient's clinical condition gradually improved over two weeks of antibiotic therapy. Repeat blood culture after two weeks of treatment was negative. The patient was subsequently discharged after four weeks of intravenous antibiotics and closely followed-up at the outpatient clinic. Her repeat echocardiography after six months showed a reduction in the size of the mitral valve vegetation with no significant regurgitation. She remained asymptomatic during the follow-up period.  Conclusion:  This report emphasizes the typical presentation of NVIE  its approach to diagnosis  and management. It also underscores the need for maintaining high clinical suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms and apparent cardiac involvement.
14,7,70,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial70,Case Report:  Patient Information and Demographics:  We report the case of a 64-year-old gentleman  Mr. B  of Caucasian origin. He is a retired accountant  a non-smoker  and has a history of moderate alcohol consumption. His past medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been regularly taking antihypertensive medication (amlodipine) and oral hypoglycemic medication (metformin) for his respective chronic conditions. He is not known to have any adverse or allergic drug reactions. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease  with the patient's father having suffered from myocardial infarction at 68 years.  Clinical Findings:  Mr. B presented at the emergency department with symptoms of fever  night sweats  and loss of appetite persisting for three weeks. He also complained of feeling generally unwell  experiencing significant fatigue  and reported unintentional weight loss.  He had noted an occasional heart palpitation but denied chest pain or dyspnea.   Diagnostic Assessment and Intervention:   Upon clinical examination  there were no signs of heart failure. Blood was drawn for testing  and the patient was admitted for hospitalization due to the ongoing and undiagnosed symptoms. Mr. B's blood cultures grew Streptococcus sanguinis. The patient was diagnosed with native valve infective endocarditis based on the clinical features  blood culture results  and echocardiogram findings  which revealed vegetations on the mitral valve.  Infective endocarditis is a rare but potentially life-threatening disease. Considering his causal microorganism  Mr. B was treated with penicillin G and gentamicin for a period of four weeks. In addition  his medications for hypertension and diabetes mellitus were adjusted according to current clinical guidelines and considering the effect of his acute infection on these chronic conditions.  Therapeutic Intervention and Follow-up:  The patient responded well to the antibiotic therapy  with resolution of his fever after two weeks and improvement in his general condition. Repeated blood cultures remained sterile  and repeat echocardiograms showed a decrease in the size of the vegetation. No surgical intervention was needed.   He spent the majority of his treatment in the hospital under strict monitoring and was discharged after being afebrile for a week and showing general improvement in his clinical condition. His diabetic control and blood pressure were stabilized at discharge.  Mr. B was scheduled for regular outpatient follow-ups to perform routine blood works  echocardiograms  and monitor his control of chronic comorbidities. During his latest clinic visit  he had remained symptom-free  and there were no signs of relapse.  Conclusion:  While native-valve infective endocarditis is infrequent  it remains particularly difficult to diagnose since the symptoms can often be vague  as seen in Mr. B's case. Rapid identification of the etiologic organism and appropriate antibiotic therapy can lead to successful management  as demonstrated by the favorable outcome observed. Clinicians should always consider endocarditis as a possible diagnosis in patients presenting with persistent fever and other non-specific systemic symptoms.
14,7,71,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial71,Patient Information:  A 63-year-old Caucasian female  Mrs. X  living in a suburban community  comes with a 2-week history of persistent fever  chills  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss. The patient has no known underlying medical conditions or habits such as drug abuse. Her family report she has 5 siblings  but none have any history of heart disease or similar symptoms. She is married with two children and she works as a schoolteacher. She is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol.  Clinical Findings:  The patient presented with a fever of 38.5°C  heart murmur  and multiple  small  painless hemorrhagic skin lesions. As part of her physical examination  reduced body weight was noted (10 kg less than the same period last year). Breath sounds were clear  without any rhonchi or crepitations. Cardiac examination revealed a systolic murmur. No hepatosplenomegaly was noted. Her blood pressure was within the normal range.  Diagnosis  Treatment  and Outcome:  With the patient's clinical presentation  history and examination findings  a diagnosis of infective endocarditis was suspected. Blood cultures were drawn and she was admitted for further observation and management. Echo-cardiography revealed large vegetations on the mitral valve. Blood culture grew Staphylococcus aureus  which was sensitive to methicillin.   Based on the Duke criteria for the diagnosis of endocarditis - positive blood cultures  echocardiographic findings and the presence of a fever - a definitive diagnosis of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus was made.   She was treated with intravenous antibiotics (Cefazolin 2g every 8 hours) for six weeks. The patient's fever gradually subsided and symptoms improved  but due to the size and position of vegetations  mitral valve replacement was done after completing antibiotic treatment. The post-surgical outcome was successful  with the patient showing full recovery and rehabilitation at the 3-month follow-up.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the need for early suspicion  diagnosis  and treatment of infective endocarditis  even in patients without any relevant medical or drug abuse history. It also underscores the importance of taking into account non-specific symptoms  such as unexplained weight loss  that could nonetheless indicate systemic infection. Regular follow-ups should be advised to such patients to ensure complete recovery and to screen for potential complications.

Medical History: The patient has a notable past medical history of congestive heart failure  which is currently managed with beta-blockers. IH was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II ten years ago that is maintained on oral hypoglycemic agents. Apart from occasional alcohol intake  he reports no use of drugs or tobacco. IH had no known allergies and his immunization records are up-to-date.  Presenting Problem: IH reported that he has been feeling fatigued and has experienced significant weight loss over the past month. He reported that his fevers peaked in the late afternoon and were associated with chills and night sweats. He denied any chest pain  cough  dyspnea  or other localized symptoms. The patient also indicated suffering from lack of appetite and having joint pain  predominantly in the knees.   Physical Examination & Diagnostics: Upon physical examination  IH was febrile with a temperature of 100.4°F and had mild tachycardia with a heart rate of 100 beats/minute. Cardiac examination revealed a mid-diastolic murmur at the mitral area. A full blood count showed elevated white blood cells with neutrophilia. His liver function test results were also abnormal  with elevated transaminases.   Echocardiography showed a mass on the mitral valve  confirming the suspicion of infective endocarditis. Blood culture was positive for Staphylococcus aureus. A diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was established.  Treatment and Follow Up: Intravenous antibiotic therapy with vancomycin was initiated. The patient was informed about the seriousness of his condition and the crucial need for hospitalization and invasive treatment. A cardiologist was consulted for a possible surgical intervention considering the patient’s persistent fever and evidence of cardiac failure.  Discussion: This case highlights the importance of index suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients with significant cardiac history who present with unexplained fever. Timely identification and management of such patients are critical to prevent potential complications and reduce mortality associated with this severe infection.
14,7,73,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial73,Title: Case Report on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Healthy 55-year-old Male  Abstract: This report represents a case study concerning native-valve infective endocarditis (IE) detection in a middle-aged male  with no prior history of heart diseases or immune suppression. The purpose is to stress the importance of considering IE among seemingly healthy individuals who present with prolonged  unspecific clinical symptoms as the timely diagnosis can potentially decrease the mortality and morbidity rates.  Patient Information: The patient involved is a Caucasian male  aged 55 years old  with no reported prior medical history relevant to cardiovascular disease or immunodeficiency. He resides in the rural upper Midwest region of the USA and works as a carpenter.  Clinical Findings: The patient initially approached a local clinic with complaints of persistent low-grade fever  fatigue  and unintentional weight loss over a span of 2 months. He also mentioned occasional night sweats without any respiratory symptoms. He denied any previous episode of rheumatic fever or history of intravenous drug use. Additionally  the patient reported experiencing intermittent arthralgia.  Diagnostic Assessment: Despite the absence of classic peripheral stigmata of endocarditis during the initial physical examinations  the presence of a new cardiac murmur triggered an echocardiogram. Results demonstrated bulky vegetations on the native mitral valve  which led to the provisional diagnosis of Native valve infective endocarditis. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  further confirming the diagnosis. The patient was devoid of any visible dental caries or periodontal disease but admitted to not seeking routine dental care. Additional workup for immunodeficiency  including HIV test  was negative.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient received treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin for two weeks. Due to persistent fever and increasing size of the valvular vegetations on repeat echocardiogram  he underwent successful mitral valve replacement surgery. Histopathology of excised mitral valve confirmed the presence of vegetation and active inflammation consistent with Infective Endocarditis.  Follow Up and Outcomes: Post-surgical recovery was unremarkable  and the patient was discharged on prophylactic oral antibiotics with regular follow-up appointments scheduled. At six months post-operation  he remained symptom-free and was physically active  with regular echocardiograms showing excellent prosthetic valve function.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed gratitude and relief post-treatment  stating that the experience had reinforced the importance of regular medical and dental check-ups.  Conclusions: Thus  this case underscores the importance of maintaining a high clinical suspicion of IE in patients presenting with unclear symptoms and the role of early detection through proactive echocardiogram analysis in securing a more favorable prognosis. It likewise emphasizes the need for routine dental care to prevent such instances in the future.
14,7,74,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial74,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Male Patient with Type 2 Diabetes  Patient Profile:   The patient  Mr. A  is a 68-year-old Caucasian man residing in urban New York. He is a retired mechanical engineer  a non-smoker  and has a moderate alcohol consumption history. His family history reveals no significant genetic predispositions or illnesses.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. A presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of fever  chills  fatigue  and shortness of breath. He also reported unintentional weight loss but denied any chest pain  cough  or abdominal pain.   Past Medical History:  He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes thirty years prior and has been managing it with daily oral hypoglycemic agents. He also had a history of hypertension for over a decade  controlled with amlodipine. Routine bloodwork  including fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels  were regularly monitored and poorly controlled. Mr. A had no previous history of cardiac diseases  surgeries or hospitalizations.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed mild pallor  an irregular heartbeat  and petechial lesions on the extremities. A grade 3/6 diastolic murmur was audible at the left sternal border. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable. Preliminary lab investigations showed a raised white blood cell count and ESR  consistent with an infection. His blood glucose level was elevated  and HbA1c was 8.0%  indicating poor glycemic control.  Imaging and Diagnosis:  Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an oscillating intracardiac mass on the atrial side of the mitral valve. Further diagnostic work-up involving blood culture grew Streptococcus viridans  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis (IE).   Treatment:  A regimen of intravenous antibiotics (Penicillin and Gentamicin) was initiated as per the sensitivity report. Mr. A also received insulin to control blood glucose levels. Despite being counseled on the possible need for valve replacement surgery in the future  he wished to proceed with medical management alone for now.  Follow-up:  Post six weeks of antibiotics therapy  Mr. A showed significant clinical improvement. Repeat echocardiography revealed a considerable reduction in vegetations's size  and his blood cultures turned sterile. He continues to be under follow-up care with improvements in diabetic control and regular cardiac assessment.   Mr. A’s case serves as a reminder of the crucial link between poorly controlled Type2 Diabetes and the risk of serious infections. Timely diagnosis  management  and adequate glycemic control have played pivotal roles in the favorable outcome in this case. 
14,7,75,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial75,Patient Information  The patient was a 65-year-old African American male with a past medical history of hypertension and cigarette smoking. He was an accountant and lived in Tremont  Ohio with his wife. He had no known allergies. He had recently been to a routine doctor's appointment a month ago and was known to be adhering to his anti-hypertensive medications. He also had an apparent history of poor dental hygiene.  Clinical Findings  The patient was admitted to the emergency department with high-grade fever  general malaise  and fatigue. He reported an episode of chills  night sweats  and unintentional weight loss for the past two weeks. He admitted having a poor appetite accompanied by nausea. On physical examination  the patient was noted to have signs of mild pallor  petechiae on his palate and conjunctiva  and notable inflammatory changes in his gums  indicative of gingivitis.  Diagnostic Assessment  Based on these symptoms  a differential diagnosis of infective endocarditis was suspected. The patient underwent a series of investigations. A full blood count indicated mild anemia and a high white cell count. The serology was positive for inflammatory markers CRP and ESR  and Procalcitonin. Three sets of blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans. The urine analysis did not provide significant findings. Echocardiography revealed vegetation on the patient's native mitral valve and moderate mitral regurgitation  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Therapeutic Interventions  The patient was treated with a two-week course of intravenous penicillin combined with gentamicin. He responded well to this course of antibiotics  showing significant improvement both clinically and in laboratory parameters. The patient was encouraged to maintain good dental hygiene and regular follow-ups to monitor his condition  and received counselling for smoking cessation.  Follow-up and Outcomes   Subsequent blood cultures at the end of his antibiotic course were negative. The patient was discharged approximately three weeks after admission. Follow-up echocardiography three months after discharge showed resolution of the vegetation and unchanged mitral regurgitation. The patient was advised further follow-ups with the Infectious Diseases and Cardiology Departments for optimum management of his condition.  Patient Perspective   The patient was scared at initial diagnosis but  upon understanding his condition better  adapted well to the treatment process. He understood the implications of the disease and engaged actively in maintaining better health habits  which included proper oral hygiene and giving up smoking.  Conclusion  This case highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis in febrile patients with risk factors  such as poor oral hygiene and cardiovascular disease. Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment resulted in a favorable outcome for the patient. It also reinforces the critical role oral hygiene can play in eliminating potential sources of bacteremia leading to endocarditis. 
14,7,76,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial76,Title: A Case Report on Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information: The patient is a 60-year-old male named John Doe who hails from a suburban setting in Dallas  Texas. His professional life included 30 years as a construction worker. He was a smoker but quit 10 years ago  but he continues to use alcohol moderately. He is married  has no children  and lives with his wife.  Clinical Findings: Mr. Doe presented to the emergency department (ED) following a period of 3 weeks of intermittent high fever  chills  fatigue  and multiple joint pains with notable weight loss. He had no previous history of cardiac illness. No family history of infective endocarditis was identified. On physical examination  he was ill-looking  with a temperature of 39 °C  blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg  and heart rate of 110 beats per min. Cardiac auscultation revealed an audible systolic murmur over the left upper sternal border. Blood tests showed raised inflammatory markers (CRP  ESR) and relatively normal cardiac enzymes. His dental hygiene was noticed to be poor.  Diagnosis: Based on clinical examination and symptoms  a suspicion of infectious endocarditis was raised. Two sets of blood cultures were drawn. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was conducted  revealing vegetation on his native mitral valve suggestive of infective endocarditis. Blood cultures isolated Streptococcus oralis  which linked the poor dental hygiene to the infectious endocarditis.  Treatment: After discussions with Infectious Disease specialists  the patient was initiated on appropriate antibiotics  which included intravenous Penicillin G and Gentamicin for synergy  for 6 weeks. The patient was equally referred to a dentist for regular dental cleanings and education.  Outcome and follow-ups: The patient's condition started improving within a week of antibiotic treatment. The patient was discharged after 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy. He showed significant improvement at the four-week outpatient clinic follow-ups  with the resolution of fever and reduction in inflammatory markers. Repeat echocardiography at 6 months showed a significant decrease in vegetation size  indicating a good response to treatment.  Learning Points: This case illustrates the importance of recognizing unusual presentations of diseases. Infective endocarditis should be considered in patients presenting with prolonged unexplained fever  especially when accompanying murmurs are found on examination. The case also highlights the importance of good dental health in preventing conditions like infective endocarditis.  Conclusion: Infective endocarditis  while relatively rare  can present without much of a discernible history of cardiac disease  as seen in this case report. A comprehensive examination  including dental health  is crucial in such scenarios to identify potential sources of infection. Timely recognition of signs and symptoms with prompt initiation of appropriate therapy can lead to favorable outcomes.

Presenting Symptoms:  He presented to the outpatient department with persistent and high-grade fever for the past two weeks  alongside rigors  night sweating  and a weight loss of approximately 15 lbs during this period. The patient reported an aftermath of fatigue and mild breathlessness on exertion but denied any history of cough  chest pain  palpitations  or fainting episodes.  Past Medical History:  His past medical record includes hypertension  managed with amlodipine 5mg daily for the past 10 years. He has no known allergies. There is no significant family history of note–barring an elder sister who succumbed to breast cancer at the age of 68.  Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  the patient was found to be febrile  with a recorded oral temperature of 39.5℃. He appeared pale and had splinter hemorrhages under his fingernails  with slight clubbing. Cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the mitral area. No other significant findings were recorded during the full body examination.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Given the historical and clinical findings  a suspicion of infective endocarditis was raised. To confirm the diagnosis  transthoracic echocardiography was performed  which demonstrated thickened leaflets and a possible vegetation in the mitral area. His hemogram showed elevated total white cell counts (13 000/μL with 82% neutrophils) and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus mutans  which corroborated the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis caused by oral flora  likely due to poor dental hygiene.  Treatment and Follow-up:  The patient was promptly initiated on targeted IV antibiotics according to the sensitivity pattern of the cultured organism (Penicillin G and gentamycin). Surgical intervention was deferred due to patient preferences and relatively preserved cardiac function with no immediate signs of heart failure. A course of 6 weeks of antibiotics was planned.  The patient also received counselling for maintenance of oral hygiene. On completion of the treatment  repeat blood cultures were negative  and there was a resolution of fever and other symptoms. His condition is currently being monitored through regular follow-ups.  Discussion:  This case emphasizes the importance of clinical suspicion and early recognition of infective endocarditis  particularly in patients presenting with unexplained fever. It also underscores the association between poor oral hygiene and the development of infective endocarditis. Regular check-ups and careful monitoring are pivotal for patients suffering from this condition to improve prognosis and limit complications.

He is a retired engineer and a non-smoker with a history of moderate alcohol consumption.   Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes mellitus type II  which are well-controlled with medication: Losartan 25 mg daily  Atorvastatin 20 mg daily  and Metformin 500 mg twice daily. He has no known drug allergies. He has been requiring regular medical follow-ups due to his chronic conditions.   Presenting Complaints: He presented to the emergency department with a week-long history of high-grade fever  chills  malaise  fatigue and mild shortness of breath. There was no associated chest pain  orthopnea  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  or pedal edema.  Clinical Findings: On examination  his temperature was 38.5°C  blood pressure 137/85 mmHg  pulse rate 85 beats/minute (regular)  respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute  SpO2 96% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur in the aortic area. Pulmonary  abdominal  and neurological examinations were unremarkable. There were no signs of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.  Timeline:  Week 1: High-grade fever (up to 38.5°C)  chills  malaise  fatigue  mild shortness of breath Week 2: Admitted to hospital  Intravenous antibiotic therapy initiated  Diagnostic Assessment: Laboratory studies showed white cell count (WCC) 11x10^9/L  hemoglobin (Hb) 12 g/dl  and C-reactive protein (CRP) 90 mg/L. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. Chest X-ray was clear. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed moderate aortic regurgitation with an oscillating mass suggesting an aortic valve vegetation  consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was admitted and empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin  after obtaining blood cultures. Viridans group streptococci sensitivity was found and antibiotic therapy was de-escalated to Penicillin G and Gentamicin.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: Over the next few weeks  the patient's condition improved gradually with reduction in fever and he reported feeling less fatigued. Serial blood cultures turned negative. Repeat TTE at 6 weeks showed reduction in vegetation size with improved aortic regurgitation.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of suspecting infective endocarditis in elderly patients who present with unexplained fever  even in the absence of heart murmurs or peripheral stigmata of endocarditis. Timely diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy can significantly improve patient outcomes and decrease the risk for potential complications.

14,7,79,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial79,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 53 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Residence: Pennsylvania  USA Occupation: Truck Driver  Presenting Complaints: Patient presented with intermittent fever  fatigue  and increased discomfort in the chest area  which has been for the past three weeks. There was also a complaint of sudden weight loss.  Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of mitral regurgitation and was prescribed long-term medications. He is also diagnosed with type II diabetes which is being managed with Metformin. There is no history of any major surgeries or transplants. The patient reported a dental procedure done around a month ago. The patient has been a smoker for the past 15 years with moderate alcohol consumption.  Clinical Findings & Diagnosis:  On examination  he appeared very pale and exhausted. He was febrile with a temperature of 100.5°F (~38.3°C)  blood pressure 130/85mmHg  and pulse rate of 95 bpm. On cardiac auscultation  a murmur was noted indicating valvular abnormalities. The routine blood tests showed an elevated white blood cell count and ESR. Blood cultures were drawn and sent to the lab.   An echocardiogram was ordered which showed vegetations on the mitral valve indicating the probability of Infective Endocarditis.   His blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus  confirming the diagnosis of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE).    Management & Follow-up:  The patient started with empirical antibiotic therapy immediately. Once blood culture reported growth of Staphylococcus aureus  the patient was put on intravenous nafcillin  in line with the condition's standard treatment guidelines.   Given the patient’s pre-existing mitral regurgitation  consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon was done considering the chance for valve replacement if required in the future. The patient was also advised on the importance of prophylactic antibiotics before any future dental or surgical procedures due to his increased susceptibility to NVIE.   After six weeks of aggressive antimicrobial therapy  noticeable improvement in the clinical status of the patient was seen. This was evidenced by the resolution of fever  fatigue  and weight gain. Repeat blood cultures were negative and Echocardiography showed reduction in the size of the vegetation.  Discharge and Follow-up:   The patient was discharged after 8 weeks of hospital stay and was advised to follow up every month as outpatient for the next 3 months for a repeat Echocardiogram  blood tests  and general check-up. Further long-term follow-ups were advised every six months for the surveillance of his cardiac condition.   In summary  this case demonstrates the successful management of NVIE in a patient with underlying mitral regurgitation and highlights the potential risks associated with dental procedures in such individuals. It emphasizes the importance of prompt diagnosis  appropriate antimicrobial therapy  and regular follow-ups in managing such cases.

Case Presentation: The patient  a Caucasian 48-year-old male  working as an IT consultant  presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fatigue  intermittent fever  night sweats and unintentional weight loss over a period of 3 weeks. He denied any recent travels  dental procedures  intravenous drug use or known contacts with infectious diseases. He has no smoking history but declared moderate alcohol consumption. The patient reported no family history of cardiac or autoimmune diseases and no noteworthy allergies.  Clinical Findings: On examination  he was found to be febrile (38.6°C) and tachycardic. Cardiac auscultation revealed a grade III/IV diastolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. No Osler's nodes  Janeway lesions  Roth's spots or splinter hemorrhages were noticed. Initial investigation showed elevated inflammatory markers  namely ESR and CRP. Blood cultures were taken  which grew Streptococus Oralis  highly suggestive of infective endocarditis.  Investigations: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a 1.3 cm vegetative mass on the aortic valve  confirming the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. No signs of heart failure were noted upon chest X-ray or electrocardiogram results.  Treatment: The patient was started on intravenous therapy with ceftriaxone and gentamicin as per the local antimicrobial protocol for streptococcal endocarditis. Surgery was not immediately considered due to the absence of heart failure  aortic regurgitation or abscess.  Outcome and Follow-Up: Due to the early detection and aggressive antibiotic therapy  the patient showed significant clinical and echocardiographic improvement within 2 weeks. He completed a 6-week course of intravenous antibiotics followed by 6 months of oral suppressive therapy. Regular transthoracic echocardiography was used to monitor the resolution of endocarditis. At 1 year follow-up  no relapse reported  indicating a successful treatment without the need for surgical intervention. The patient was trained on oral hygiene as a preventive measure against further occurrences.   Discussion: This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition of native-valve infective endocarditis even in individuals without any known cardiac history. Noteworthy in this case is the rarity of infective endocarditis in a previously healthy individual with no predisposing factors. Oral hygiene and dental health must be highlighted when educating the community about the prevention of infective endocarditis.   Patient's Perspective: """"The diagnosis was truly a shock as I believed to be in great health. Though the treatment was long and at times uncomfortable  I am relieved to be in good health again.""""  Learning Points: This case reinforces two important aspects: no patient history detail is too small when diagnosing  and that healthy individuals are not immune to severe infections like infective endocarditis. Vigilance and patient education are indispensable tools for prevention and early diagnosis."
14,7,81,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial81,Patient Information: Mr. X is a 58-year-old Caucasian man who works as a construction supervisor. He resides in a suburban area and is a non-smoker. He has a history of alcohol consumption but quit drinking 5 years ago. He is a widower  living alone with occasional visits by his adult children. His only regular medication is ibuprofen  taken as needed for knee pain.   Medical History:  The patient has hypertension which was diagnosed ten years ago  for which he was on antihypertensive medication until a year ago when he quit due to the side effects. He has been in good health and has not been hospitalized before. He denies illicit drug use  recent travel or any recent infectious disease contacts.   Presenting Complaint:  He presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of fever  malaise  and night sweats. He also complained of exertional dyspnea  reduced exercise tolerance  and an unintended weight loss of approximately ten pounds within the past month.   Clinical Findings:  On examination  he was febrile  with a temperature of 38.5°C. He had a systolic murmur  and vascular phenomena such as Janeway lesions on his palms and soles. He also had Osler’s nodes which were tender subcutaneous nodules on the pulp of the digits indicating vasculitis. There was no evidence of peripheral edema  and his lungs were clear on auscultation.   Diagnostic assessment:  Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  consistent with Infective Endocarditis (IE). Transthoracic echocardiography showed a thickened aortic valve with moderate aortic regurgitation and a mobile vegetation. He underwent transesophageal echocardiogram which confirmed a 15mm mobile mass attached to the ventricular side of the aortic valve.  Therapeutic Intervention:  He was initiated empirically on intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin  which was later switched to penicillin G and gentamicin based on culture sensitivities. Despite four weeks of antimicrobial therapy  the patient continued to have intermittent fevers and his inflammatory markers remained persistently elevated.   Follow-up and outcome:  He ultimately required surgical intervention – an aortic valve replacement – after which he fully recovered. The patient was educated about the importance of good oral hygiene to reduce the risk of recurrent infective endocarditis since he was found to have significant dental caries that might have been the initial source of bacteremia.

14,7,83,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial83,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a Middle-Aged Female: A Case Report  Introduction: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe infection of the heart's endocardial surface  usually involving the heart valves. It is often associated with significant morbidity and mortality and has diverse clinical presentations  thus posing a significant challenge in diagnosis and treatment process. We report a case of native valve infective endocarditis in a 52-year-old woman with no known predisposition for endocarditis.  Case Presentation: The patient  a 52-year old Caucasian woman  a housekeeper by occupation  presented to the emergency department of our hospital with a 3-week history of intermittent fever  unintentional weight loss  loss of appetite  accompanied by fatigue  generalized weakness  night sweats  and a recent episode of syncope. She denied any history of recreational drug use  dental procedures recently  or any known cardiac conditions. Her past medical history was remarkable for intermittent asthma and osteoarthritis. She was a non-smoker and consumed alcohol occasionally.  On physical examination  she was febrile  with a temperature of 38.5°C  blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg  and a heart rate of 102 beats/minute. Examination of the heart revealed a diastolic murmur best appreciated at the left lower sternal border. Pulmonary exam was clear to auscultation. The spleen was palpable  but the rest of the examination was unremarkable. There were no identifiable peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.  Investigations revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 14 000 cells/μL  with 87% neutrophils and a mild anemia with a hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL. Blood cultures were obtained and she was started on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. Transthoracic echocardiogram exhibited a mobile echodense mass attached to the ventricular side of the anterior mitral leaflet suggestive of a vegetation  and a moderate mitral regurgitation was noted.   Blood cultures grew Streptococcus mitis  a viridans group streptococci  which are known to be a common causative organism of native valve endocarditis. This  coupled with her clinical symptoms and echocardiographic findings  confirmed the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  The patient was treated with a 4-week course of penicillin and gentamicin  considering the sensitivity of the isolated organism. The post-treatment course was uneventful  and at three months follow-up  she showed no signs of infection or heart failure  and a repeat echocardiography showed the disappearance of the vegetation and improvement in mitral regurgitation.  Conclusion: While infective endocarditis is typically associated with known cardiac conditions  intravenous drug use  or recent invasive procedures  it can occur in individuals with no known risk factors. Early identification  appropriate antibiotics  and management of complications are crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality in these patients. Further research is required to improve the understanding and management of IE in patients with no established predisposing factors.

It refers to an infection of a heart's native valves caused by bacterial  fungal  or other microbial agents. We present a unique case of a 45-year-old female individual with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Case Presentation: A 45-year-old Caucasian woman  with a history of intravenous drug abuse  presented to our facility with a two-week history of severe fatigue  night sweats  weight loss  and general malaise. She had a prior medical history of untreated type-2 diabetes mellitus and hepatitis C that she contracted in her early 30s due to previous intravenous drug use. She had no history of congenital heart disease  heart surgery  placement of heart devices  or any antecedent valvular diseases. She was a smoker  consuming approximately a pack of cigarettes a day  but denied any consumption of alcohol. Notably  she reported no recent dental procedures or trauma.  On admittance  her vitals were unstable: blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg  temperature of 39.0°C  pulse rate of 120 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Physical examination was remarkable for pallor  Osler nodes on hands and feet  and Janeway lesions on the palms and soles. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new cardiac murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation.  Investigations: Laboratory analysis showed an elevated white blood cell count of 17.5 × 10^9/L (normal: 4-11x 10^9/L) with 89% neutrophils  indicating a high likelihood of bacterial infection. Inflammatory markers were significantly elevated: C-reactive protein (CRP) of 150 mg/L (normal: <5 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 70 mm/hr (normal: <20 mm/hr). Blood samples were taken and sent for cultures. Serologic tests for HIV came back negative. Chest X-ray findings were insignificant. An echocardiogram demonstrated vegetations on the aortic valve suggestive of NVE.   Culture results confirmed the diagnosis  showing the presence of Staphylococcus aureus  a common causative agent for NVE  especially in patients with a history of intravenous drug use.   Management and Outcome: The patient was initiated on high-dose intravenous antibiotic therapy (vancomycin and gentamicin). After initial stabilization  considering the persistent fever  poor echocardiographic features  positive blood cultures  and large vegetations  she was referred for valve surgery. Postoperatively  she responded well to treatment with complete resolution of symptoms and no complications. She was discharged after two weeks of in-hospital recovery and put on a course of oral antibiotics for 6 weeks  along with an integrated care plan for her diabetes and hepatitis C. She was also referred to a drug rehabilitation program.  Discussion: This case highlights the significance of prompt identification and management of individuals presenting with NVE.

Medical History:  The patient has a medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both well controlled with medication. No allergies have been reported by the patient. He has no past hospitalizations or surgeries. Family history includes a father with coronary artery disease and a mother with stroke. Patient denies any illicit drug use.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient came in complaining of fatigue  loss of appetite  a ten-pound weight loss over the past month  and a fever  which was intermittent in nature  accompanied by night sweats. There was no history of domestic traveling or exposure to animals in the past.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient was febrile (temperature 38.5°C)  with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg  pulse rate 90 bpm  and saturating 95% on room air. Cardiac exam revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the aortic area. No Osler nodes or Janeway lesions were noted. Lab findings showed mild leukocytosis  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  The patient's clinical symptoms along with lab findings pointed toward possible infective endocarditis. An echocardiogram was ordered which revealed a vegetating mass on the aortic valve  confirming the diagnosis. Three separate blood cultures were taken 30 min apart  which grew Streptococcus viridans  corroborating with the diagnosis.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was started on intravenous (IV) Penicillin G  targeting the identified organism  and Gentamicin for its synergistic effect. Infectious Disease services were consulted for input on antibiotic regimen and duration. Upon the approval of the infectious disease team  the initial treatment regimen was continued.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  The patient responded well to treatment with resolution of fever after one week. Repeat blood cultures taken at the end of the second week showed no bacterial growth. The patient's general condition also improved significantly. He was discharged on the 28th day of admission with instructions to complete a 6-week course of IV antibiotics via a peripherally inserted central catheter. He will continue to follow up at the infectious diseases and cardiology outpatient clinics.  Patient Perspective:  The patient was relieved to see improvements in his health after starting the treatment. He expressed gratitude for the medical team's efforts and was committed to complete the full course of his prescribed medications.  Informed Consent:  The patient provided informed consent for producing this case report.  Peer Review:  This case report was peer-reviewed by the hospital’s Infectious Disease Board.
14,7,91,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial91,Title: Native-valve Infective Endocarditis in an Elderly Patient with Previous Rheumatic Heart Disease  Case Report: Patient Identity: A 71-year-old Caucasian male   Clinical Presentation: The patient presented to the emergency department with persistent high-grade fever for the past 10 days  associated with chills  sweating  fatigue  and loss of appetite. He also reported a recent unintentional weight loss (~7% of his body weight over two weeks). Notably  he had experienced similar episodes of fever three times in the last six months  each lasting a week and subsiding on its own without any specific treatment.  Past Medical History: The patient had been diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease (RHD) at the age of 12 and had been taking penicillin prophylaxis until the age of 20. Since then  he only took the medicine sporadically and discontinued it completely after the age of 40. He reported no other chronic conditions and mentioned he had been a social drinker up until 10 years ago. Regular annual medical check-ups for the past 5 years had not revealed any significant abnormality. He did not report any recent dental procedures  surgery  or intravenous drug use.  Physical Examination: He was febrile (102.5°F)  with a heart rate of 105 beats/minute and blood pressure at 115/70mmHg. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur over the mitral area. There were no notable pathological findings in other organ systems. There were no signs of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.  Investigations: A series of blood cultures were ordered  all of which came back positive for Streptococcus viridans. Echocardiography revealed vegetations on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE). There were signs of moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation but no evidence for abscess  fistula  or other valvular abnormalities. Chest X-ray and ECG were within normal limits.  Treatment and Outcome: The patient was initiated on a four-week course of intravenous penicillin G and gentamicin in keeping with the sensitivity pattern. He responded well to the therapy  with fever subsiding within a week and significant improvement in his general condition. Post-treatment echocardiogram showed a reduction in the size of vegetations  and blood cultures were negative. However  due to persistent mitral regurgitation  the patient was referred for surgical evaluation of potential mitral valve repair or replacement.  Conclusion: This case underlines the significance of long-term prophylaxis in patients with RHD and the potential complications  such as IE in those who discontinue it. It emphasizes the importance of a high degree of suspicion for IE in patients with RHD presenting with recurrent unexplained fever. The further investigation  timely diagnosis  and appropriate antibiotic management are crucial in the overall prognosis of such patients  potentially avoiding the need for cardiac surgery.
14,7,92,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial92,Case Report: Title: Case of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 58-year-old Woman  Patient Information: A 58-year-old Caucasian woman with a medical history of hypertension  Type II Diabetes Mellitus  and dyslipidemia presented to her primary care physician with complaints of general fatigue  intermittent fevers  overall weakness  and unexpected weight loss over a period of several weeks.  Description of Illness: The patient was initially managed with oral antibiotics for a presumed bacterial infection. However  her symptoms persisted despite the initial treatment. The woman reported that the fever was intermittent and predominantly in the evening  often associated with chills and sweats. She also indicated that she had lost around 10 pounds in the last month without trying to do so. No change in diet or exercise was reported.  Investigations: Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg  an elevated pulse rate of 98 beats per minute  and a temperature of 38.5°C. Heart auscultation demonstrated a soft systolic ejection murmur in the aortic valve area and the presence of a new diastolic rumble at the apex. Laboratory analysis revealed elevated inflammatory markers  anemia  and positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus. An electrocardiogram (ECG) exhibited no abnormalities. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.  Given the persistent bacteremia and the new cardiac murmur  the suspicion for endocarditis led to further investigations. A Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) revealed an oscillating intracardiac mass on the aortic valve suggestive of a vegetation  confirming the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.   Treatment: The patient was urgently referred to a tertiary care center for specialized treatment. Empiric antibiotic therapy was immediately started with intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone  which was later adjusted to targeted treatment based on the sensitivities of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from her blood cultures.  Outcome and Follow-up: The patient's condition improved gradually following antibiotic therapy. However  due to the size and location of the vegetation on the valve  she eventually required surgical intervention to prevent further complications. A follow-up TTE after six weeks of starting antibiotics and post-surgery showed no vegetations with a normally functioning aortic valve. She was referred back to her primary care physician for continuous monitoring and follow-up.   Learning Points: This case highlights the atypical presentation of native-valve endocarditis in a patient with significant comorbidity. The importance of early detection  understanding the characteristic signs and symptoms  and prompt treatment of infective endocarditis is essential in significantly reducing associated morbidity and mortality. Clinicians must suspect endocarditis in any patient presenting with persistent fever and other systemic symptoms  regardless of their past cardiac history.
14,7,93,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial93,"Case Report: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 68-year-old Male  Patient Information:  A 68-year-old Caucasian male was presented to the emergency department with symptoms including persistent fever  shortness of breath  and significant unintentional weight loss over the past month.  Medical History:  The patient had hypertension and hyperlipidemia that were being managed with prescribed medications: Amlodipine 5mg daily and Atorvastatin 20mg daily. He has an extensive history of tobacco use but quit smoking 12 years ago. He reported having a """"heart murmur"""" years ago; however  he had not had any follow-up or treatment for it. He denied any previous history of intravenous drug use. He had no known drug allergies.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  On physical examination  he looked chronically ill  having a fever of 39.2 degrees Celsius. Cardiac examination revealed a pansystolic murmur most prominent in the mitral area. Laboratory tests showed marked leukocytosis  elevated C-reactive protein and a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Blood cultures were taken.  An ECG showed sinus tachycardia but was otherwise unremarkable. Chest radiography demonstrated no active disease. The patient was admitted to the hospital  and empirical antibiotic treatment was initiated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin.  Transthoracic and Transesophageal echocardiography revealed significant mitral regurgitation with a vegetation of 1.2cm on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve  suggestive of infective endocarditis. Blood cultures later confirmed growth of Streptococcus viridans.  Throughout his hospital stay  the patient underwent serial Echocardiograms to monitor progression of his vegetative lesions. His antibiotics were de-escalated based on culture sensitivity to Ceftriaxone alone  which was continued for the next six weeks.  Therapeutic Intervention:  His case was discussed with cardiothoracic surgery  and given the size of the vegetations and significant mitral regurgitation  he underwent mitral valve repair surgery. Post-operatively  the patient improved significantly. He had no further fever spikes  and his shortness of breath lessened.  Follow Up and Outcome:  The patient continued his six-week course of antibiotics post-operatively. He experienced a significant improvement in symptoms  his laboratory parameters returned to normal  and repeat echocardiography showed a well-functioning mitral valve with no residual regurgitation or vegetation.  The patient was discharged home on long-term prophylactic antibiotics (oral amoxicillin) and asked to follow up at a cardiology outpatient clinic regularly.  Conclusion:  This case report indicates the importance of considering a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis in older patients with a history of a heart murmur presenting with unexplained fever and weight loss. It also underscores the importance of the multi-disciplinary management of infective endocarditis  including cardiac imaging  targeted antimicrobial therapy  and when indicated  surgical intervention. Regular follow-up care is vital in managing symptoms and preventing potentially fatal complications."
14,7,94,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial94,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 65-Year-Old Male: A Case Report  Introduction: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe and potentially life-threatening infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. Its presentation can be an insidious onset of non-specific systemic symptoms or an acute infection with rapidly progressive disease. We describe here a case of native-valve infective endocarditis in a 65-year old male.  Case Presentation: The patient  Mr. J  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  non-smoker  who lives in an urban area. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with amlodipine and metformin respectively.   Mr. J presented to the ER with a two-week history of intermittent fever  fatigue  and a new onset of shortness of breath. On admission  he was febrile (38.5°C)  his blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg  and his heart rate was 96 beats/minute. On physical examination  he had a diastolic murmur heard on the left sternal border  and Osler's nodes were present on examination of his hands and feet. No relevant travel or contact history was reported.  Investigations: Laboratory results on admission showed elevated white blood cell count (15 x 10^9/L)  elevated C-reactive protein (140 mg/L)  and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (70 mm/hr). Blood cultures were drawn. The patient also had elevated levels of HbA1c (8.6%).   A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed vegetations on the tricuspid valve with severe tricuspid regurgitation  confirming the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus  a common causative agent of IE.  Management and Outcome: The patient was started on empiric intravenous antibiotics: nafcillin and gentamicin. After blood culture results  the regimen was continued due to the sensitivity of the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria to these antibiotics. The patient's infective endocarditis was managed medically due to the absence of indications for emergent surgical intervention  such as heart failure  uncontrolled infection  or the occurrence of systemic emboli.  Following four weeks of antibiotic therapy  the patient's condition improved significantly. Repeat blood cultures turned out negative  echocardiography showed a reduction in vegetation size  and he was no longer febrile. The patient was discharged and instructed to monitor his blood glucose levels more regularly.  Discussion: This case illustrates a typical presentation of native valve IE. It underscores the importance of early recognition given the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with the condition. It also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive patient history  physical examination  and the use of appropriate laboratory and imaging techniques for a timely diagnosis and treatment.  Conclusion: In infective endocarditis  early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve outcomes. Despite improved diagnostic strategies and therapeutic options  IE remains a serious condition with high morbidity and mortality rates  especially in patients with risk factors like diabetes. Therefore  increased vigilance and aggressive treatment are essential.
14,7,95,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial95,Title: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis in a 61-year-old Male: A Case Report  Introduction:  This case report presents a 61-year-old gentleman diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. The aim of this report is to offer better insight into the clinical manifestations  risk factors  cardiac complications  and the importance of early diagnosis of this rare disease in middle-aged men.  Case Presentation:  A 61-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to our hospital with complaints of intermittent fever  night sweats  general malaise  and unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds over a two-month span. The patient's medical history was remarkable for aortic stenosis and hypertension. He is a non-smoker and has a history of moderate alcohol intake. The patient has been on antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril) for the last 8 years and did not report having any dental procedures or invasive surgery recently.  On physical examination  the patient appeared generally unwell. He had a temperature of 38.8 degrees Celsius  blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg  pulse rate of 92 beats per minute  and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur in the left sternal edge. There were no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.   Investigations:  Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16 000/uL  raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 80mm/hr  and C-reactive protein at 96mg/L. Blood culture showed growth of Streptococcus Bovis. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed large vegetation measuring 1.5 cm attached to the ventricular side of the aortic valve. The patient also underwent colonoscopy due to the association between Streptococcus Bovis and colorectal carcinomas  which was negative.  Diagnosis:  The patient's clinical presentation  positive blood cultures  and echocardiographic evidence clinched the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management and Follow-Up:  The patient was started on intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin as per the AHA guidelines. Despite being on antibiotics  the patient's condition deteriorated due to congestive cardiac failure secondary to aortic valve destruction. We had an urgent consultation with the cardiothoracic team for valve replacement and the patient underwent successful biological aortic valve replacement.  The patient made a progressive recovery post-surgery and completed six weeks of antibiotic treatment. On follow-up visits  he was asymptomatic with a marked improvement in his overall condition. There were no signs of congestive heart failure and serial blood cultures were negative indicating resolution of endocarditis.  Conclusion:  This case report underscores the varied presentations of native-valve infective endocarditis. High clinical suspicion and early cardiac imaging are vital for prompt diagnosis. Despite successful valve replacement and antibiotic treatment  the prognosis remains challenging due to cardiac and embolic complications. It further elaborates the link between Streptococcus Bovis bacteremia  infective endocarditis  and colorectal cancer  emphasizing the importance of gastrointestinal screening in such patients.

He also has a documented history of hypertension treated with Lisinopril and Amlodipine. His family history reveals a father with ischaemic heart disease and a mother with rheumatoid arthritis. There are no previous episodes of infections requiring hospitalizations or prolonged antibiotic treatment.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. J presented to the hospital with a two-week history of intermittent fever  chills  malaise  and unintended weight loss of about 8-10 pounds. He also reported an episode of a night sweat. No history of chest pain  cough  or difficulty in breathing was reported.  Examination: Mr. J appeared pale and fatigued. His vital signs were as follows: Blood pressure - 140/90 mmHg  Heart rate - 100 beats per minute  Respiratory rate - 16 breaths per minute  and Temperature - 38.8°C. Cardiovascular examination revealed a diastolic murmur heard at the left sternal border. Other examinations were unremarkable.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Blood investigations showed a raised white cell count and C-reactive protein. Three sets of blood cultures were obtained over the next 24 hours as a part of the febrile illness workup. All blood cultures grew Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) identified an echodense vegetative mass attached to the native aortic valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment & Outcome: Treatment was initiated immediately on confirmation of the diagnosis  with intravenous antibiotics (Nafcillin and Gentamycin) for 6 weeks duration guided by cultures sensitivity. His diabetic and hypertensive medications were continued and adjusted as necessary. He responded well to treatment  with resolution of fever  and serial blood cultures taken in the following weeks were negative. On repeat TTE at the end of therapy  the vegetative mass was significantly diminished. He was discharged with a plan to follow up in the outpatient clinic.  Conclusion: This case demonstrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients with equivocal symptoms  especially those with risk factors like diabetes. Always consider endocarditis in patients with unexplained fever  weight loss  and positive blood cultures. Early detection and treatment can result in good outcomes as in our patient Mr. J.

14,7,100,diagnosis14-prompt7-trial100,Patient Demographics: Patient Initials: F.M. Age: 62 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer Living Conditions: Lives alone Geographic Location: Midwest  USA  Case Report: F.M.  a 62-year-old Caucasian retired engineer  presented with a 2-week history of low-grade fever  fatigue  unexpected weight loss  and intermittent night sweats. He was first treated for a urinary tract infection by his primary care physician but did not improve with antibiotics. His past medical history was significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Upon examination  he showed signs of pallor  an unexplained new murmur upon cardiac auscultation  and several Osler's nodes (tender lesions found on finger/toe pads) were present. His initial laboratory investigations showed anemia  elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)  and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus mutans. An echocardiogram revealed abnormal findings suggestive of vegetations on the tricuspid valve.  Diagnosis and Treatment:  Based on the characteristic clinical signs  pathological blood culture results  and imaging findings  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made. F.M. was admitted to the hospital and immediately started on intravenous antibiotics per protocol  a combination of Penicillin G and Gentamicin  in order to cover the identified organism. The patient's condition gradually improved over the course of hospitalization.  The clinical team decided against emergency surgery  and treatment was continued with an extended course of intravenous antibiotics  given the patient responded well to the initial management. Continual follow-up and monitoring  including repeated echocardiograms and blood cultures  have been scheduled as the patient remains on long-term oral antibiotics as outpatient treatment.  Discussion:  Infective endocarditis predominantly affects those with previous heart valve disease  but can occur  although rarely  on previously normal valves as in our patient's case. The case demonstrates the importance of considering infective endocarditis in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms such as fever  fatigue  and weight loss particularly when associated with new cardiac murmurs and positive blood cultures. Timely intervention with targeted intravenous antibiotics  and careful patient monitoring can reduce the associated morbidity and mortality. Furthermore  the necessity of continuous follow-up care to ensure complete resolution of the disease and monitor potential complications such as congestive heart failure and systemic embolizations is highlighted.   This case is particularly relevant for primary care physicians and emergency health staff  drawing attention to the initial nonspecific presentation of such a significant condition  which if missed  could result in severe complications  including death.

14,9,1,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial1,Patient Profile:  The patient  Mr. Johnson  is a 64-year-old Caucasian male who lives alone. He is a retired engineer who used to work in an industrial plant. He is a non-smoker and leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle but has a history of occasional alcohol consumption.   Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a significant past medical history of Diabetes Mellitus Type II and Hypertension  both of which have been controlled through lifestyle modifications and medication. He also underwent an appendectomy 30 years ago.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department citing persistent fever for the past ten days  which was previously thought to be a flu-like symptom. Other symptoms include fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  chills  and a new-onset heart murmur.  Family history:  His father died of a myocardial infarction at 76  and his mother is still alive at 88  with a history of rheumatoid arthritis. His two older siblings are alive and well. There are no known hereditary illnesses in the family.   Evaluation and Diagnosis: Physical examination reveals splinter hemorrhages under the nails and Osler's nodes on his fingers - both common in infective endocarditis. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis (increased white cell count)  elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate)  and a positive blood culture for Streptococcus. The chest x-ray was normal. However  transesophageal echocardiography detected vegetations on the mitral valve confirming the diagnosis of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis.  Management: Mr. Johnson was started on intravenous penicillin for the streptococcal infection along with gentamicin for possible synergistic effect. His blood glucose and blood pressure are being monitored regularly to manage his diabetes and hypertension.  Summary: This case underlines the importance of considering Infective Endocarditis in patients with persistent fever and relevant physical findings  especially in those with comorbidities like diabetes  which could make them more susceptible to infections. Further  the characteristic clinical findings  coupled with laboratory and echocardiographic evidence  are important for timely diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic therapy to prevent further complications.
14,9,2,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial2,Patient Information: Mr. Smith  a 50-year-old male farmer of African American descent  had presented to the emergency department with complaints of persistent high-grade fever  fatigue  weight loss  and an intermittent heart murmur for the past three weeks. Previously fit and healthy  he does not consume alcohol  smoke  or engage in any illicit drug use. His only medication is occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. He reports no travel history or recent illness. He lives alone on his farm and has no family history of heart diseases or autoimmune diseases.   Clinical Findings & Diagnostic Assessment:  Biochemical investigations showed mildly raised inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR). Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans. On physical examination  significant findings include low-grade fever (100.8 F)  mild tachycardia (110 bmp)  a regular heart rhythm  and an early diastolic murmur audible at the left sternal border. Cardiovascular examination detects a new murmur of mitral regurgitation.   Further investigation with Transthoracic Echo (TTE) confirmed vegetation on the mitral valve compatible with the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. No signs of embolization were observed upon neurological or retinal examination.   Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted to the hospital and started on empiric antibiotic therapy with IV ceftriaxone and gentamicin  following cardiologic and infectious disease consultations. The treatment was later de-escalated to IV ceftriaxone monotherapy for four weeks  when blood cultures confirmed susceptibility to this antibiotic.   Considering the large size of his vegetation and his persistent symptoms  the decision was made to perform early valve repair surgery. Post-operative course was uneventful  and he showed considerable improvement on surgical follow up.  Discussion: Mr. Smith's case highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis to prevent life-threatening complications. Despite the absence of significant risk factors  his prolonged exposure to strep viridans from his farming occupation possibly predisposed him to this condition. His successful management combined both aggressive antibiotic therapy and timely intervention  underscoring the role of a multi-disciplinary approach in caring for patients with infective endocarditis.   Plan:  Mr. Smith was advised about dental hygiene and the importance of preventive dental care. We also arranged frequent cardiology out-patient follow-ups to monitor his progress and echocardiogram every six months in the first year and then annually. His GP was informed of his condition  and he was provided resources to maintain good general health  including a balanced diet and regular exercise.  
14,9,3,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial3,Patient Presentation: The patient  Mr. Smith  is a 59-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. He has a past medical history of tobacco use  moderate alcohol consumption  previously managed type two diabetes (T2DM)  and hyperlipidemia. Mr. Smith maintains an active lifestyle  with no experience of intravenous drug use  which typically characterizes this condition. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with his father passing away following a myocardial infarction at the age of 63.   Clinical Presentation: The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of high-grade  intermittent fever for a month  along with told fatigue  weight loss  night sweats  and decreased appetite. Recent check-ups revealed a systolic murmur. He does not recall any significant illnesses  invasive dental procedures  or recent travel.  Examination and Diagnostic Testing: Upon physical examination  he appeared ill and maintained a low-grade fever. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new regurgitant murmur involving the mitral valve. There were also classical manifestations noticeable such as petechiae on the conjunctiva and on the fingers of both hands (Osler’s nodes). Lab tests showed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)  C-reactive protein (CRP)  and normocytic anemia consistent with the patient's reported symptoms. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  the leading cause of native-valve endocarditis. The echocardiogram showed vegetations in the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  Treatment and Prognosis: Given the diagnosis  Mr. Smith's treatment plan included a continuous four-week course of intravenous antibiotics under close monitoring. The team also referred him to a cardiologist for consideration of possible surgical intervention due to the formation of vegetation on the mitral valve. With the early detection of the disease and other supportive measures  the patient's prognosis appears satisfactory.   Subsequent monitoring and regular follow-ups with primary care and specialty physicians are critical to ensure the effective management of both endocarditis and his pre-existing T2DM condition. There are plans for revaluation and reinforcement of lifestyle modifications to counter his nicotine and alcohol consumption  as these are risk factors for infective endocarditis and can potentially complicate his diabetes and hyperlipidemia. It is also crucial to remind Mr. Smith about the importance of good oral hygiene to reduce his risk of endocarditis further.
14,9,4,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial4,Patient Profile:   Mr. Jose  a 73-year-old male  of Asian descent  retired engineer  presented at our hospital with complaints of high-grade fever and malaise persisting for four weeks. He also reported an unintended weight loss of about five kilograms over the last two months. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially. His daily activities mainly involve gardening.

Family History:  Mr. Jose's father passed away at 74 due to myocardial infarction  while his mother died at 78 from a stroke. He has two siblings; the elder one (a 75-year-old brother) has type 2 diabetes mellitus and the younger one (a 71-year-old sister) is healthy.   Clinical Findings:  On clinical examination  he appeared unwell and pale. Standard examination protocols revealed febrile episodes with a maximum temperature spike of 38.5 degrees Celsius. Cardiac auscultation noted a grade 3/6 pansystolic murmur best heard at the apex. Roth spots were found in his retina while Janeway lesions and Osler nodes were absent.   Investigative Findings:  Labs were significant for leukocytosis with predominance of neutrophils and normocytic normochromic anemia. His C-reactive protein was significantly raised while other markers including renal function  liver enzymes  coagulation parameters were within normal ranges. The blood cultures isolated Streptococcus viridans. Echocardiogram showed a vegetation on the anterior leaflet of mitral valve along with previously known moderate mitral valve regurgitation.  Diagnosis and Management:  Based on clinical findings  the lab investigations  positive blood culture for Streptococcus viridans and echocardiogram results  a diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made. He was started on intravenous penicillin in consultation with the infectious disease team. Cardiothoracic surgeons have been briefed about the case and the patient is currently under close observation to monitor his progress. He responded well to the regimen and is currently awaiting valve replacement. Patient and family have been educated about the nature of the disease  potential complications  importance of meticulous hygiene and necessity for ongoing endocarditis prophylaxis post valve-replacement.   Conclusion:  This case once again highlights the need for high clinical suspicion in elderly patients presenting with persistent unexplained fever  weight loss and pre-existing valvular disease. Native-valve endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans required aggressive and prolonged antibiotic therapy.
14,9,5,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial5,Patient Information:  Mr. Smith  45-years-old Caucasian male  presents to the outpatient clinic with complaints of fatigue  body aches  consistent low-grade fever for the past three weeks  and recently developed a new-onset systolic murmur. A Real Estate Agent by profession  Mr. Smith reports experiencing night sweats and unintentional weight loss. His body mass index (BMI) is 23.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a medical history of type 2 diabetes and a mild stroke incident three years back. He also has a history of periodontal disease. He is currently on Metformin and aspirin.  Family History:   There is a family history of cardiovascular disease as his father had a myocardial infarction at age 50.  Social History:  Married with two kids and a non-smoker  Mr. Smith occasionally has a glass of wine over the weekend. He does not use recreational drugs.   Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  petechiae were present on his palate  and a new systolic murmur was heard over the mitral region. Laboratory work demonstrates mild leukocytosis and elevated ESR. Blood cultures yielded the growth of Streptococcus Viridians.  Diagnosis:  The clinical  laboratory  and examination findings  combined with his previous history of periodontal disease (potential source of the bacteria)  direct us towards the diagnosis of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis.  Management Plan:  The Infectious Disease team recommends empirical antibiotic therapy with Ceftriaxone and Gentamicin. A transesophageal echocardiogram will help evaluate the extent of the valve damage and need for potential surgical management. Dental referral will ensure care for his periodontal disease and reduction of future risks. His diabetic screening will be reassessed because hyperglycemia can disrupt immune responses  increasing the infection risk.  Discussion:  Mr. Smith's case is consistent with the typical presentation of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis. In such cases  diabetes and periodontal disease play a significant role as risk factors since both can act as sources for bacteremia  leading to subsequent colonization and infection of heart valves.  The future plan should be focused on strict glycemic control and optimal dental hygiene with regular surveillance. The whole team would continue to monitor him for treatment responses  side effects and potential complications. His family history warrants further cardiovascular evaluation and risk assessment for preventive strategies. 
14,9,6,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial6,Patient Profile Name: JB Age: 65 years old  Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired factory worker  Presenting Complaints JB presents to the ER with complaints of fever  malaise  fatigue and a distinct heart murmur noticed for the past two weeks.  Past Medical History JB has a known case of type-2 diabetes mellitus  which he has been managing for the past ten years. He also has chronic hypertension and has been on antihypertensives for the same period.  Social History JB is a lifelong smoker  averaging a pack a day  and he admits to moderate alcohol use. He does not use other forms of tobacco or illegal substances. He lives with his wife  they have limited contact with extended family  and he is not exposed to any potential occupational hazards or travel-related illnesses.  Family History His father died of a stroke at 70  and his mother died of breast cancer at 68. He has one older brother who has ischemic heart disease.  Clinical Findings On physical exam  there are Osler's nodes present on the fingers and toes. Other findings include splinter hemorrhages in the nail beds  petechiae in the conjunctiva  Roth spots in the eye  and Janeway lesions on the palms and soles.  Investigations The laboratory tests show elevated inflammatory markers (ESR  CRP) and positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus. His echocardiogram reveals a vegetation on the mitral valve indicative of endocarditis.  Diagnosis With his clinical findings and the results from investigations  JB has been diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. His infectious symptoms combined with the presence of positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus and echocardiogram revealing vegetation on the mitral valve are supportive of this diagnosis.  Management: Immediate management includes hospital admission with the initiation of intravenous antibiotics under the direction of infectious disease specialists. Given the echocardiogram findings  a cardiothoracic surgery consult for possible valve replacement is also being considered. JB's diabetes and hypertension also need to be regularly monitored and managed during his hospital stay. Smoking cessation advice and help with managing alcohol use were also recommended  as these will aid in his overall prognosis and quality of life.  Discussion: Infective endocarditis is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart  which can include one or more heart valves  the mural endocardium  or a septal defect. Its intracardiac effects can include severe valvular insufficiency  which may lead to intractable congestive heart failure and myocardial abscesses. If left untreated  infective endocarditis is generally a fatal disease. Thus  prompt recognition  appropriate antibiotic management and  if indicated  surgical intervention are crucial to outcome. Risk factors such as diabetes  smoking and hypertension  which are present in JB’s case  increase the susceptibility to this condition and the possibility of severe outcomes.
14,9,7,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial7,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Garcia is a 67-year-old Hispanic male  accountant by profession  who is living alone in an apartment in Queens  Brooklyn. His past medical history includes uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He has a history of heavy smoking (pack a day) but quit three years ago. He has no known drug allergies. His medications are Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.  Mr. Garcia walks in the clinic accompanied by his son with a chief complaint of fatigue  unintentional weight loss  low-grade fever  and night sweats that has been persistent in the last five weeks. He also mentioned the recent onset of a vague  dull chest pain. He denies any cough  shortness of breath  orthopnea  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  or drug use. He also denies any recent dental procedures  or recent travel.  On physical examination  he was found to have a new onset heart murmur. Hill's sign and splinter hemorrhages were also observed  which raised the probability of infective endocarditis. No other abnormalities were found.  Laboratory results showed an elevated ESR  C-reactive protein  white blood cell count  and a decreased hemoglobin level. His fasting blood sugar was 180mg/dl  and HbA1c was 8.1%  indicating uncontrolled diabetes. His renal function tests and liver function tests were within normal limits. The two sets of blood cultures drawn 12 hours apart grew Streptococci viridans. An echocardiogram demonstrated vegetations on the native mitral valve with severe mitral regurgitation  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Family history revealed that his father had died of myocardial infarction at the age of 69 years  and his mother has Alzheimer's disease. His two brothers are alive and well  both have hypertension  and one brother has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.   The patient is therefore diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis possibly due to uncontrolled diabetes acting as a risk factor for infections  and the same is further complicated by his hypertensive condition. Mr. Garcia has been admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotic therapy as per the IDSA guidelines.  This case highlights the importance of a comprehensive examination when patients report vague conditions such as fatigue or fever  particularly in individuals with a high-risk profile such as uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension.

14,9,12,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial12,Patient Presentation:  Mr. B is a 56-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of worsening malaise  fever  and new onset of shortness of breath.  Complete Demographics:   He is a sedentary office worker who lives in the urban area with his wife. He is a nonsmoker and occasionally consumes alcohol socially. Mr. B does not report any illicit drug usage.  Past Medical History:  Mr. B was previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus five years ago  for which he takes Metformin. He also has a background of hypertension  which is maintained with Lisinopril. No previous history of any cardiac disease or invasive procedures is documented.  Family History:   His father passed away at 64 due to a cardiac event and his mother is alive at 82 with Type 2 diabetes and osteoarthritis. He has one brother who is relatively healthy.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. B complained of persistent fever peaking at 39.2 degrees Celcius  breathlessness on exertion  reduced appetite  and weight loss of approximately 5kg over the last month. A cardiac murmur was detected on clinical examination.  Investigations:   Blood cultures were obtained that showed growth of Streptococcus viridans. Tranesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed vegetations on the native aortic valve confirmed diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  Management Plan:  Mr. B was started on empirical antibiotic treatment for Streptococcus viridans - benzylpenicillin. His symptoms began to improve significantly within a few days. Additionally  diabetic control was also addressed considering his recent weight loss and infection. A cardiology consult was sought for further management of native valve infective endocarditis.  Discussion:  Infective endocarditis (IE) is a microbial infection of the endothelial surface of the heart  which involves heart valves in most cases. It commonly manifests as a constellation of fever  heart murmur  and bacteremia with the ability to seed other organs. Diabetic patients like Mr. B have compromised immune systems  making them more prone to infections like IE. Early detection and prompt treatment is pivotal in alleviating mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Future preventive strategies would involve good oral hygiene practice and appropriate prophylaxis during high-risk procedures for our patient.

14,9,13,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial13,Patient Introduction:   Mr. John Doe is a 50-year-old male  residing in Brooklyn  New York. He is a lawyer by profession and enjoys playing basketball outdoors.  Presenting Complaint:  Mr. Doe presented with intermittent fever  fatigue  malaise  and a recent loss of appetite that began approximately two weeks ago. He sought medical attention after noticing that his symptoms were worsening and his fever persisted.  Past Medical History:  John has Hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus which is currently well controlled with Metformin and Lisinopril. He has a history of smoking and quit 7 years ago. He's been relatively inactive for the past few years but overall does not follow a sedentary lifestyle. He is up to date on all immunizations and has had no previous hospitalizations or surgeries.  Physical Examination:  On examination  John's fever was confirmed (38.6°C) and he displayed pallor and fatigue but was coherent and alert. Cardiovascular examination noted a mild systolic murmur that was not previously documented.  Investigations:  Blood counts showed a moderate decrease in red blood cells  suggestive of anemia  and an increase in white blood cells  an indication of infection. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated  indicating ongoing inflammation. Blood cultures were sent to the lab and confirmed a diagnosis of Native-valve Infective Endocarditis. An echocardiogram confirmed the presence of vegetation on the native heart valve  further reaffirming the diagnosis.  Family History:  John has a family history significant for cardiovascular disease  his father suffered a heart attack at age 65. His mother has well-controlled type II diabetes and hypertension.  Treatment:  He was initially started on empiric antibiotic treatment targeting common causative organisms for infective endocarditis  which was then tailored following a conclusive blood culture report.  Discussion:  Mr. Doe is a typical case of infective endocarditis  with the classic presentation of fever  malaise  appetite loss  and the onset of a new murmur. His age  previous heart history  and diabetes make him more susceptible to this infection.  Considering John's profession  high-stress situation and unhealthy dietary habits may be considered. Due to his diagnosis he will need to undergo prolonged antibiotic therapy  may need surgical intervention if medical management fails  and may have future implications for health status and quality of life.  Follow Up:  Regular follow-up appointments to monitor the progress and to observe any complications is necessary. Promotion of a healthy and active lifestyle will also be beneficial for him.  This case underlines the importance of considering infective endocarditis in patients who present with persistent fevers and have risk factors  such as age  certain comorbidities  and family history of heart disease. 
14,9,14,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial14,Patient Presentation  Name: John Doe Age: 45 Race: Caucasian Sex: Male Occupation: Construction worker  Mr. Doe presents with a 2-week history of intermittent high-grade fever  chills  and excessive night sweats. Upon examination  he was found to have two Janeway lesions on his palms and three petechial lesions on his lower limbs.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe was admitted and treated for acute rheumatic fever when he was 19. He also had a history of type II diabetes mellitus and was currently under metformin treatment. He quit smoking when he was 30 and consumed alcohol on social occasions.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Doe is primarily concerned about his persistently high fever and weakness. For the past two weeks  he has been facing fatigue and shortness of breath while carrying out simple daily activities such as climbing stairs.  Clinical Evaluation: A clinical examination revealed a new-onset grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur. Dental evaluation showed signs of chronic dental infections  suggesting a likely source of bacteremia. Lab tests confirmed anemia indicative of chronic disease. The patient's WBC count was elevated. Blood culture revealed the presence of streptococcus viridans. Echocardiographic (TEE) results exhibited oscillating intracardiac mass on the mitral valve  confirming Native Valve Endocarditis.  Family History:  The patient's father was diagnosed with coronary artery disease  and his mother had a history of hypertension. The family doesn't have any known history of endocarditis or other valve-related diseases.  Impression:  The patient's clinical manifestations and lab results (positive blood culture  new murmur discovered on echocardiography  Janeway lesions) corroborate the diagnosis of infective endocarditis as per the Duke Criteria.  Plan: Considering the clinical diagnosis of Native Valve Endocarditis in Mr. Doe  he would require immediate intravenous antibiotic therapy per guideline management. Comprehensive care involving a cardiologist  infectious disease specialist  and possibly  a cardiothoracic surgeon is required to manage this serious condition. Cardiothoracic surgery referral is for the assessment of the necessity for surgical intervention. His diabetes also needs to be consistently monitored and managed during the course of his treatment. Strict dental hygiene measures need to be advised to avoid potential sources of bacteremia.   The patient was unplanned but cooperated well during the assessment. Education about his diagnosis and management plan was provided  and he understood the severity and complexity of the disease. He agreed to follow the outlined treatment plan.  Prognosis: With immediate treatment  the patient's prognosis is fair. Valve damage could be limited  and the infection can be arrested. However  the prognosis will greatly depend on the patient's adherence to therapy and control of other underlying conditions. Regular follow-ups and diligent diabetes management are critical to prevent potential complications.

14,9,16,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial16,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: A Caucasian female  aged 68  mother of two children  from a middle-income group hailing from rural northeastern United States. The patient has no known history of substance abuse.  Relevant Medical History: The patient was previously diagnosed with type II diabetes and hypertension 5 years ago. Also  she is on regular medication for osteoarthritis since 3 years. The patient has had no prior surgeries or transplants. No history of any communicable diseases or incidences of a similar cardiovascular disease. The patient's BMI is in the upper limit of the normal range.  Relevant Family History: The patient's mother suffered from rheumatic heart disease and both her children are physically fit with no known chronic ailments. No significant history of heart disease  diabetes  or other chronic diseases on the paternal side of the family.  Presenting Illness: The patient was brought to the hospital with complaints of persistently high fever for the past 1 week (~101°F) and chills. She has been experiencing shortness of breath and general weakness. Chest pain on exertion has also been frequently reported.   Examinations: A physical examination revealed a new heart murmur  suspected to be a mitral regurgitation. Splinter hemorrhages were found under her nails  indicating subacute infective endocarditis (IE). Laboratory investigations revealed elevated ESR  CRP  and leukocytosis signifying an inflammatory response. Blood cultures were drawn and sent for analysis to determine the causative microorganism.  Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. The diagnosis was confirmed through the modified Duke criteria - with 2 major criteria (positive blood culture for IE and new regurgitation murmur) and 1 minor criterion (fever > 38°C) being met.  Treatment: The patient was hospitalized and started on empiric antibiotic therapy  primarily intravenous Vancomycin and Gentamicin  pending blood culture results. Frequent monitoring of vital signs was stipulated. Measures to control her blood glucose levels and blood pressure were also instituted.  Prognosis: Given the patient's age  co-morbidities and the severity of her condition at presentation  the prognosis could be challenging  though survival rates have improved with aggressive antibiotic therapy and potential surgical intervention.  Due to her significant risk factors including her age  the presence of diabetes and hypertension  she is at a higher risk of complications such as heart failure  stroke  and further systemic embolism. She will require ongoing  long-term cardiology followup after discharge.
14,9,17,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial17,Patient Presentation:  I am presenting a case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. Jones  with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Background:  The patient has a past medical history of congenital heart disease  specifically a bicuspid aortic valve  which predisposes him to valvular disease. He has no history of intravenous drug use or recent dental procedures. His mother also had a congenital heart condition  suggesting a weak genetic link. Additionally  Mr. Jones had been smoking for 20 years and only quit five years ago  and he also has diabetic mellitus type II which is controlled by metformin. He lives with his wife in the suburbs and is retired. He used to work as a mechanic  no history of travelling abroad or exposure to pets.  Presenting symptoms:  Mr. Jones presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of malaise  anorexia  low-grade fever  and a new murmur that a visiting healthcare nurse detected. He also reported unintentional weight loss  night sweats  and joint pain – symptoms which are indicative of endocarditis.  Investigations and Clinical findings:  On arrival  his temperature was 100.5°F  heart rate was 100 beats per minute  and blood pressure was 140/85 mmHg. Oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. A cardiac exam revealed a diastolic decrescendo murmur  most prominent at the right upper sternal border. His fingernails had splinter hemorrhages  and there was Osler’s nodes on his palms - signs associated with endocarditis. Blood work showed mild anemia and raised inflammatory markers. Three sets of blood cultures were taken which grew Group B Streptococci.  Conclusion:  An echocardiogram demonstrated vegetations on the bicuspid aortic valve with severe aortic regurgitation and early signs of heart failure  confirming our diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. After discussing with a cardiothoracic surgeon  we considered surgery due to the severity of the aortic regurgitation and heart failure signs. Meanwhile  the patient was started on intravenous antibiotics based on the sensitivity report.  Mr. Jones was referred to dental services for a review. Due to his predisposing factors  he was further advised to take prophylactic antibiotics before any dental procedures in the future. His wife was also educated about the signs and symptoms of infective endocarditis  they were advised on proper follow-up visits  and catheter care was provided.

Family History   His father died of a myocardial infarction at age 70  and his mother had type 2 diabetes and hypertension. One older sister alive without any significant medical illness. No family history of any infectious diseases.  Clinical Examination   On examination  his blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg  pulse 82 bpm  temperature 38.5C  respirations shallow at 22 breaths per minute. Cardiac examination revealed a systolic murmur heard best at the right second intercostal space and a diastolic murmur at the apex. No peripheral stigmata of endocarditis were noted. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Investigations  Full blood count showed mild anemia (Hb 10.2 g/dL) and elevated white cell count (13.2 x 10^3/µL) with neutrophilia. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels were also raised indicating ongoing inflammation. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  suggesting potential infective endocarditis. The chest X-ray reveals no specific abnormalities. Electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy with no signs of ischemia. Echocardiography showed a large vegetation present on the aortic valve associated with severe aortic regurgitation  confirming a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Plan and Discussion  Started on intravenous penicillin G and gentamicin for a synergistic effect against S. viridans  and gentamicin stopped after 2 weeks  while penicillin was advised for up to 4 weeks. Consulted cardiothoracic surgery for valve replacement options due to the severe aortic regurgitation. Informed patient and his family about his diagnosis  treatment plan  risks and prognosis. The patient agreed to stay in the hospital for the initial treatment period and undergo heart valve replacement. Emphasized importance of follow-up and adhering to a prescribed course of antibiotics to prevent recurrence and complications.   The patient's clinical condition  comorbid diabetes and smoking history put him at higher risk for infective endocarditis and potential complications.

14,9,19,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial19,Patient Information:  Mr. John  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  is a sales manager living in the suburban area of New York City. He is married with two adult children. He is a non-smoker but admits to moderate alcohol consumption. The patient's family history is suggestive of cardiovascular diseases; his father died early due to a myocardial infarction  while his mother had a stroke in her late seventies.  Chief Complaint:  Mr. John complained of unintentional weight loss  persistent fever  fatigue  night sweats which have persisted over the last 3 weeks.  History of Present Illness:  The patient had initially developed flu-like symptoms 3 weeks ago  which did not subside despite being under medication. His condition progressively worsened over time with noticeable weight loss and generalized fatigue. The continuous high-grade fever and episodes of chills brought the patient to seek professional healthcare assistance.  Past Medical History:  Mr. John has a history of rheumatic fever at the age of 15 but did not develop any significant complications. He was treated 2 years ago for dental caries and underwent a dental extraction. There is no medical history of diabetes  hypertension or any other chronic diseases. He has not had any legally reportable or communicable diseases.  Physical Examination:  Physical examination revealed a mild pallor  with splenomegaly upon examination of abdomen. A cardiac examination indicated a murmur suggesting possible involvement of valves.  Investigations:  Laboratory investigations showed elevated ESR  CRP levels and mild anemia. His blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans  which indicated ongoing infection in body. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed vegetation on mitral valve  supporting the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  Management:  The patient is immediately hospitalised considering the severity of the condition. Intravenous antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone is initiated  under the guidance of an infectious disease specialist. Recommendation for the patient also includes regular follow-ups with cardiology to monitor the condition of the heart valves.  Discussion:  Mr. John’s signs  symptoms and echocardiography results are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. It is likely that his history of rheumatic fever as well as dental extraction could have predisposed him to this condition.

He was presented to the ER with complaints of lasting fatigue  fever  shortness of breath  and increased lethargy that had been ongoing for about two weeks. He is also noted to have lost a significant amount of weight during this period  which he recounts as approximately 15lb.  Medical History:   Mr. X was diagnosed with untreated Type II diabetes mellitus around 10 years ago and has had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to his longstanding use of cigarette and occasional marijuana smoking. His other past medical history is significant for Hepatitis C and hypertension. His medications include metformin  lisinopril for hypertension  atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia  and salbutamol inhaler for COPD.  Family History:   His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 50 years  and his mother has Type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He has no siblings. Both his parents are alive and well. His family history also revealed that his maternal uncle died at an early age of 42 from a cause unknown to the patient.  Examination and Lab Findings:   On physical examination  he was found to be febrile with a body temperature of 102.1F  blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg  pulse rate of 80 beats per minute  and 95% oxygen saturation on room air. The patient appeared jaundiced with scattered ecchymoses and exhibited signs of poor dental hygiene. Cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur at the right sternal border. On a respiratory examination  he had decreased breath sounds in both the lower lung fields. Laboratory investigations revealed a raised white cell count of 16 000/ul  blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus  elevated liver enzymes  and negative HIV results.  Diagnosis and Treatment:  Given the findings  the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made  following the modified Duke criteria. An echocardiogram confirmed a vegetative growth on the tricuspid valve. The patient was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin. He was also referred to the dental department for his dental issues. His usual medications were optimized  and he was referred to the dietician and physiotherapist for his unintentional weight loss and for improving his overall lifestyle habits.  From a public health perspective  his case highlights the importance of thorough history taking  especially in individuals with a history of drug abuse and those of a higher age. It also underscores the need for the regimented management of chronic conditions like diabetes and the potential physiological infringements of poor dental hygiene.
14,9,22,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial22,Case Presentation  Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. K  who lives with his wife in the suburbs. His occupational history reveals that he is a retired construction worker and a former smoker who quit about 10 years ago. He denies the use of any illicit drugs.  Chief Complaint: Mr. K presented to the hospital complaining of a two-week history of fatigue  nighttime fevers  and unexplained weight loss.  Past Medical History: The medical records of the patient reveal a history of aortic stenosis for which he has been undergoing treatment. He is on daily low-dose aspirin and occasionally uses nitroglycerin for chest pain brought on by exertion. He also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  a condition linked with his smoking history  but this has been under control with the use of inhalers.  Family History: Patient's father died at age 72 due to heart failure. His mother is alive and at 90 years old  experiences frail health due to age. He has a brother who suffers from hypertension. No history of cancer  stroke or diabetes runs in his family.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination reveals a febrile patient with a temperature of 100.5°F  pulse of 90 bpm  and BP of 130/85 mmHg. The patient looks a bit pale and fatigued. A heart examination identifies a diastolic murmur compatible with aortic regurgitation. In addition  an ocular examination reveals Roth spots.  Investigations: Blood tests revealed mild anemia (Hb 10g/dl) and elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 12mg/dl  ESR 50mm/hr). Blood cultures were taken and sent for analysis. An echocardiogram was performed and it showed a mobile mass on his aortic valve compatible with vegetation.  Diagnosis: Based on the history  physical examination  and diagnostic findings  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made.  Management Plan: The patient was admitted to the internal medicine ward and commenced on empiric antibiotic therapy following local guidelines for native valve endocarditis. The organism responsible for the infection and its sensitivity to antibiotics was determined upon the availability of the blood culture results.   Discussion: Mr. K's pre-existing aortic stenosis  in conjunction with his symptoms and clinical findings  is suggestive of infective endocarditis  confirmed by the presence of vegetation on his aortic valve via an echocardiogram. He is at a higher risk due to his heart valve condition. His treatment will largely involve prolonged intravenous antibiotic medication. Later  a need for surgical intervention may arise depending on the response to the treatment.  Note: This clinical case is made for illustrative purposes only and does not refer to a real patient.
14,9,23,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial23,Patient Presentation: Subject: Mr. G  a 63-year-old Caucasian male  diagnosed with native valve infective endocarditis.  Past Medical History: Patient has a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  chronic kidney disease  and hypertension.  Presenting Complaint: The patient was admitted with pyrexia (fever) for 6 days  malaise and a progressive shortness of breath.  Family History: Positive history of cardiovascular diseases in the family. Both parents expired due to heart attacks at 70 and 72 respectively. Older sibling living with coronary heart disease.  Social History: The patient is a retired school teacher and a non-smoker. He occasionally consumes alcohol and reports no illicit substance use. He lives with his wife  son  and his son’s family. His son is the primary caregiver.   Examination: On examination  the patient was found to be febrile (38.6°C) and short of breath. On auscultation  a systolic murmur at the mitral region was noted. A few petechiae were found on the hard palate. His blood pressure was measured at 135/85mmHg.  Investigations: Blood tests showed increased leukocytes (18 000/microliter) and reduced hemoglobin (11g/dL). Blood cultures confirmed presence of Staphylococcus aureus. Echocardiogram revealed vegetation on the mitral valve and moderate mitral regurgitation  confirming the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  Management: The patient was sta​rted on empiric antibiotics while awaiting blood culture results and then moved to a targeted regimen of intravenous antibiotics once the organism was identified as Staphylococcus aureus. He shows slow improvement over two weeks of therapy.  Plan: Continuation of antibiotic therapy for six weeks from first negative blood culture. Daily monitoring of vital signs and weekly monitoring of blood counts and renal function. An echocardiogram to be repeated at 2 weeks to assess response to treatment. Early mobiliz​ation and physiotherapy initiated for exercise tolerance.  Discussion: Infective endocarditis is a rare but serious condition  especially in patients with an existing heart disorder and diabetes  like Mr. G who also has a family history of cardiovascular disease. Early diagnosis and intensive treatment with appropriate antibiotics remain crucial elements of management. Long-term prognosis would depend on response to therapy  surgical intervention if needed  and patient's overall health status impacted by his existing conditions.
14,9,24,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial24,Patient's Profile  The subject of this case presentation is a 50-year-old African American male patient  Rodney. Born and raised in Chicago  he works as an information technology specialist. He smokes a half-pack of cigarettes a day and occasionally drinks alcohol socially. He has no known allergies.  Medical History  Rodney has a past medical history of psoriasis and hypercholesterolemia  both of which are currently well managed with medication. He has no surgical history. He has been relatively healthy until recently when a physician diagnosed him with native-valve infective endocarditis (IE). Before the diagnosis  he presented with symptoms such as fever  fatigue  night sweats  weight loss  joint and muscle aches  and a new heart murmur.  Family History  His mother is alive at the age of 76 and has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. His father died at age 70 from a heart attack  and he had a history of coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia. His older sister is currently facing a breast cancer diagnosis  while his younger brother is healthy.  Diagnosis and Management  Rodney's diagnostic workup included a blood culture that revealed Streptococcus viridans. His transthoracic echocardiogram showed vegetation on his mitral valve consistent with IE. He has been subjected to empirical antibiotic treatment with penicillin and gentamicin as per Infective Endocarditis Society guidelines while awaiting the results of further cultures.  Considering the dental procedures Rodney underwent within the past four weeks  which joins the fever  heart murmur  positive blood culture  and echocardiogram findings  his diagnosis is consistent with native-valve IE resultant from a potential dental source.  Plan  He is currently hospitalized and has started an intravenous antibiotic treatment of vancomycin and gentamicin. Depending on his response  the treatment can last from 4-6 weeks. Cardiology has been consulted  and based on the patient’s symptoms  heart failure is not currently an issue.  Rodney will be educated about managing IE  including the importance of medication compliance. Also  dental hygiene and its link to his condition will be addressed to avoid recurrence. Rodney's smoking and lifestyle will be addressed through counseling on smoking cessation  healthy diet  and exercise.  Infective endocarditis is a serious condition and  in Rodney's case  is complicated by his previous medical history. His health professionals will need to monitor him closely.
14,9,25,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial25,Patient Information: A 62-year-old male caucasian patient was referred to our cardiac unit with severe malaise  fever  loss of appetite  recent weight loss  and shortness of breath over the past two weeks.   Medical History: The patient has a history of rheumatic heart disease developed in childhood and has been treated with benzathine penicillin G prophylaxis since then. He had a history of intravenous drug use in the past which has been discontinued for the last 20 years. There are no known allergies. He is hypertensive and maintained under Metoprolol and Ramipril. There are no previous surgeries reported.  Current Presentation: Physical examination revealed a temperature of 39.3°C  blood pressure was 130/85 mmHg and pulse rate was 92 beats per minute. Cardiac examination was significant for a systolic regurgitant murmur. He was oriented but appeared fatigued and slightly lethargic. A few petechiae were noticed on his upper extremities and conjunctiva.  Investigation Results: A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed as a part of the investigation protocol  which indicated valvular vegetations and regurgitant flow  suggestive of infective endocarditis. Further to this  blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus.   Treatment So Far: The patient was initiated on empirical antibiotic therapy with a combination of Vancomycin  Gentamicin  and Rifampin based on the clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis.   Family History: The father passed away at 64 due to cardiac arrest  and the mother died at 70 due to breast cancer. His only sibling  a younger sister  has also been diagnosed with hypertension.   Outlook: His outlook is severe given the advanced stage of endocarditis  however  the patient's fairly healthy lifestyle and no ongoing drug abuse increase the chances of a positive response to antibiotics therapy.   Plan: It is proposed to continue with broad-spectrum antibiotics  monitor the patient's response  perform serial cardiac imaging  and reassess valve function at regular intervals. The patient may eventually require surgical intervention due to valvular damage  given the history of a pre-existing heart condition. Close communication with infectious disease specialists is being maintained for optimal management and intervention  if conditions worsen.  Informed Consent: The patient has been notified of the severity of his condition  the treatment plan  and potential surgical interventions. He has given his consent to proceed as advised.

He is a nonsmoker and only drinks alcohol on special occasions.  Presenting Concern: He presented to the emergency department complaining of fever  chills  fatigue and malaise. Of note  he had been having intermittent low-grade fevers for the past two weeks  which he attributed to work-related stress and dismissed.  Medical History: He has a 10-year history of uncontrolled Type II diabetes for which he takes Metformin. Further  he has hypertension  controlled with Lisinopril. He also has a previous history of rheumatic fever in his late teens but didn't develop any rheumatic heart disease.  Family History: His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 67 and his mother passed away due to complications of diabetes. His siblings remain in good health.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.7⁰C  BP: 135/90 mmHg  pulse rate: 98 bpm. A heart auscultation noted a new systolic murmur. Splinter hemorrhages were seen under the nails. Blood tests revealed raised inflammatory markers (CRP  ESR) and uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c: 8.5). Multiple sets of blood cultures were taken and empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated as per local guidelines.  Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms  his prolonged fever  the newly developed heart murmur  and his risk factors (uncontrolled diabetes)  a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed  which showed vegetations on his native mitral valve consistent with infective endocarditis. The diagnosis was further confirmed when the blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  a common causative agent for infective endocarditis.  Current Medication: Following diagnosis  the antibiotic regimen was adjusted as per sensitivity testing of the cultured bacteria. His current medication list includes Intravenous Penicillin G  Gentamicin  Metformin  and Lisinopril.  Management and Prognosis: Mr. AB was transferred to the cardiology unit for close monitoring. Consultations with cardiac surgery were made for any requirement of valve replacement surgery. He is currently stable; however  his prognosis largely depends on his response to antibiotic treatment and the potential need for surgery.  Follow-up: He is scheduled for daily blood cultures and weekly echocardiograms  along with strict glucose control and BP monitoring. On stabilization  patient education would be geared towards injection drug safety  if applicable  oral hygiene  and prompt treatment of infections given the patient's diagnosis. He will be encouraged to regularly monitor his blood glucose levels to optimize his diabetes control.  The significance of close follow-up appointments to monitor for potential complications such as congestive heart failure  systemic embolisms  stroke  arrhythmias  or repeated infection will be communicated to the patient.

14,9,30,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial30,Case Presentation  Patient Information:  Mr. AB  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  engineer by profession  presents to the hospital with a chief complaint of extreme fatigue  intermittent fever  and a newly developed heart murmur. He lives in the suburbs with his wife and has 2 adult children. He is a non-smoker and drinks socially.  Patient History:    Mr. AB has a medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin and lifestyle modifications  and he experienced an episode of strep throat last year which was treated with antibiotics. He has not had any surgical interventions in the past. Mr. AB has been generally in good health until these recent symptoms initiated.   Family History:   His family history is notable for cardiovascular diseases  with his father passing away at age 75 due to congestive heart failure. His mother  aged 80  is alive and well with a history of hypertension. His older brother has been diagnosed with CAD (Coronary artery disease).  Examination and Diagnostics: On examination  Mr. AB appeared ill and mildly short of breath. His temperature was 38.2°C  heart rate 98 bpm  blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg  respiratory rate 18 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation 93% on room air. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new systolic murmur over the mitral area. Laboratory test showed increased inflammatory markers - ESR – 85 and CRP - 124. Two sets of blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridians.  Echocardiography was performed which showed large vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment: Mr. AB was started on intravenous antibiotics (Penicillin and Gentamicin) as per the national guidelines  in addition to his regular medication for diabetes. The patient responded favorably to this treatment with a reduction in fever and improved general health.   Discussion: In this case  Mr. AB's past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus may have predisposed him to streptococcus viridians infective endocarditis. Furthermore  he seems to have a genetic predisposition to cardiovascular disease  which could further elevate his risk. Early detection in this case was crucial  as infective endocarditis can lead to serious complications  including septicemia and heart failure.  Future / Ongoing Management: This case dictates a need for aggressive treatment  continuous vascular monitoring  frequent follow-ups post hospital discharge  and diabetes control for Mr. AB. Patient education about the signs and symptoms of infective endocarditis should be reinforced for early detection and timely treatment of any potential future episodes. Long-term prophylaxis is recommended considering his history of strep throat and present infective endocarditis.

Prognosis:  The patient's condition is serious  given the complications that can arise from infective endocarditis. However  early diagnosis and intervention improves the prognosis. Hospitalization is typically required for IV antibiotics and close monitoring. Despite appropriate therapy  infective endocarditis has high morbidity and mortality rates  and careful follow-up care is necessary.   The patient is aware of his situation and has expressed his readiness to adhere strictly to the treatment regimen to improve his health status.
14,9,32,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial32,Patient Details:  Mr. John Doe  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the hospital with a two-week history of unremitting fever and unintentional weight loss. He lives in a suburban community with his wife. He is a retired teacher with a history of moderate alcohol consumption and occasional smoking. He denied any illicit drug use. There is no known drug allergy.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe is known to have mild hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus  both under control with daily medications. He had an episode of Rheumatic fever as a child but has not had any cardiac issues since then. He was hospitalized a few years back due to a mild stroke  leaving him with a negligible residual left-sided weakness. He has no known history of any immunosuppressive condition and chronic illnesses such as liver  kidney  or lung disease.  Family History: John's parents died of age-related illnesses  his father at 85 from congestive heart failure  and his mother at 90 from stroke complications. He has one brother living with coronary artery disease aged 65. There is no known family history of infective endocarditis or any other significant genetic disorders.  Case Presentation: Mr. Doe presented in the ER with symptoms of unremitting fever  night sweats  and weight reduction of close to 10 pounds over two weeks. On physical examination  he was found to be febrile with temperature reaching 101°F  mildly tachycardic  and tired-looking. Heart auscultation revealed a systolic murmur. Blood pressure and oxygen saturation were within normal ranges.  Lab Findings:  His complete blood count showed a high white cell count  mainly neutrophils. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans. Elevated levels of C-Reactive protein and ESR were also indicative of inflammation. His urinalysis showed microscopic hematuria.   Imaging: A chest radiograph was normal. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a vegetation on the mitral valve  confirmed by a follow-up transesophageal echocardiography.  Treatment: A diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made. He has been started on appropriate intravenous antibiotics (penicillin and gentamycin) after liaising with the Microbiology department. Surgical intervention was considered  but the cardiology team decided to monitor his progress with medical therapy first.  The patient and his wife were educated about the disease  its natural course  potential complications  and warning signs to report immediately. He is currently admitted and is being regularly monitored for response to treatment and potential complications.   Overall  the prognosis seems fair given early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antibiotics therapy. The continued interdisciplinary approach involving infectious disease specialists  cardiologists  and possibly cardiac surgeons will be critical in managing his condition.
14,9,33,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial33,Patient Presentation:   Mr. J is a 68-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the hospital with symptoms of fatigue  shortness of breath  mild fever  and decreased appetite for the past two weeks. He has a past medical history of rheumatic heart disease from his childhood  mild hypertension managed with lifestyle modifications  and tobacco use for the past 40 years. He lives alone and denies any significant alcohol use. There is no family history of heart diseases  but his mother had late-onset Alzheimer's disease and his father passed away due to prostate cancer.  Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  he appeared frail with pale conjunctivae  suggesting anemia. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new murmur  and he also showed mild peripheral edema. His blood pressure was 130/85 mmHg  and he had a pulse rate of 88 beats per minute.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Blood tests showed normocytic anemia and slightly raised white cell counts. The ESR and C-reactive protein levels were elevated  suggesting an ongoing inflammatory process. Blood cultures came back positive for Streptococcus viridians. An echocardiogram was performed  which showed vegetations on the mitral valve suggestive of native valve endocarditis.  Treatment:  Mr. J was immediately started on empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone  and once the blood culture sensitivity results came in  the treatment was adjusted to penicillin G and gentamicin. He responded well to the treatment  with improvement in his symptoms and reduction in inflammatory markers.   Discussion:  In this case  the patient’s history of rheumatic heart disease was a significant risk factor for the development of infective endocarditis. The presence of a new murmur  in association with symptomology consistent with this diagnosis  and echocardiogram findings  all pointed towards the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.  Mr. J's case highlights the importance of a thorough investigation in a patient with a cardiac murmur  fever and other non-specific signs and symptoms like fatigue  where infective endocarditis should be a key differential diagnosis. Furthermore  it illustrates the significance of prompt diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis  which  if left untreated  could result in catastrophic outcomes such as systemic emboli  severe valvular damage  and congestive heart failure.
14,9,34,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial34,Patient Presentation  Our patient  Mr. J.D.  is a 58-year-old Caucasian male from rural Kansas employed in the agriculture sector. He has no known history of drug abuse. He has been diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.   Past Medical History   Mr. J.D's medical history reveals type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 20 years  which is managed through diet and oral hypoglycemic agents. He also has a history of hypertension which is controlled via medication. Mr. J.D. has been smoking one packet of cigarettes per day for almost 40 years and consumes alcohol occasionally. There are no prior records of any infectious diseases  either community-acquired or nosocomial.   Family History  Mr. J.D. has a positive family history of cardiovascular disorders. His father had coronary heart disease and his mother had chronic hypertension and died from heart failure at the age of 74. Mr. J.D. has two siblings; his younger brother has type 2 diabetes and his elder sister is clinically obese.  Present Illness  Around 2 weeks ago  Mr. J.D. started experiencing episodic fevers along with night sweats. He also complained of occasional chest pain  shortness of breath  and feeling tired more than usual. He also noticed the appearance of unusual dark spots on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet. He self-medicated for flu  but his condition did not improve.  On careful examination  he presented with pallor  a low-grade fever  mild splenomegaly  and a heart murmur  suggestive of possible infective endocarditis. His blood cultures have also indicated the presence of Streptococcus bovis  further pointing toward infective endocarditis.  Plans for Management and Discussion   Currently  Mr. J.D. has been started on a course of suitable antibiotics  and his general and cardiological status is being monitored closely. Given his prior medical conditions  particularly the type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  we need to manage this situation delicately. Moreover  the causative organism  Streptococcus bovis  often has associations with colorectal neoplasms  suggesting a possible need for colonoscopy screening. We intend to review his condition periodically to ensure his symptoms improve and make any necessary adjustments to his treatment plan accordingly.   The prognosis is generally favorable for patients diagnosed with native-valve endocarditis if it is detected early and adequately managed. However  Mr. J.D.'s case may be complicated by his advanced age  hypertension  diabetes  and smoking habits  which can affect his response to therapy and recovery period. It's crucial for us to take a multi-disciplinary approach to his management. Intensive monitoring  effective treatment  lifestyle changes  and more  including possibly involving a cardiologist  endocrinologist  and a nutritionist in his care team  will be essential to optimizing his outcomes.
14,9,35,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial35,Patient Information: The patient  Mr. Thompson  is a 61-year-old African American male. He is retired and lives alone in a suburban community.  Present Health Status: Mr. Thompson was admitted with a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. He complained of fever  chills  night sweats  unintended weight loss  and shortness of breath for the past two weeks.  Past Medical History: He has a long-standing history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the last 10 years. He also has a history of occasional tobacco and alcohol use.

His sister  who is currently 58  was recently diagnosed with breast cancer.  Clinical Findings: On examination  his blood pressure was 170/90 mmHg  heart rate 95 bpm  and temperature 38.7°C (101.6°F). He appeared ill and fatigued. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur heard best at the cardiac apex  suggestive of mitral regurgitation. An eye examination showed Roth spots and Janeway lesions were present on the palms and soles.   Investigations: Laboratory findings showed an ESR of 79 mm/hr and a positive rheumatoid factor  indicative of an autoimmune response. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans. Echocardiography confirmed vegetations on the mitral valve  a finding consistent with the diagnosis.  Management: The patient was initiated on intravenous antibiotics for Streptococcus viridans following the recommended protocol for native-valve infective endocarditis. A treatment plan was devised to address the patient’s uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension. The patient was counseled on lifestyle modifications to limit alcohol and tobacco usage. A consultation with a cardiologist was made for potential surgical evaluation given the patient's advanced disease state.  Prognosis: Despite the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy  patients with infective endocarditis  particularly elderly patients with multiple comorbidities and untreated underlying conditions  are at high risk for complications  including valve destruction  embolic events  and treatment failure.
14,9,36,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial36,Patient Case Presentation ------------------------------------------------------------------  Demographics ----------------- The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Edward. His self-reported weight is about 90 kilograms with a height of 1.8 meters  and he leads a sedentary lifestyle. He's a widower and lives alone  having lost his wife five years ago.  Medical History ------------------- Mr. Edward's past medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes for which he has been on metformin and a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide respectively. He also has mild obesity as confirmed by his body-mass index (BMI). He admits to smoking about a pack of cigarettes a day for the past 30 years and indulges in moderate drinking of alcohol during social events. There is no known history of illicit drug use.  Family History ------------------- On exploration of his family history  his father had a myocardial infarction at age 65 and his mother suffered from osteoarthritis. There is a record of vascular disease and hypertension in his family. He has one younger brother with no significant health issues.  Presenting Symptoms ---------------------------- Mr. Edward presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of persistent fever  chills  night sweats  and considerable weight loss over a short period. He also complained of generalized weakness  fatigue  and shortness of breath on exertion. He denied any chest discomfort  abdominal pain  or changes in bowel movements. His appetite remained constant.  Diagnosis ------------ On admission  his vital signs were: temperature of 38.5°C  pulse rate 95 beats/min  respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min  blood pressure 145/90 mmHg  and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. His physical exam was remarkable for a new-onset systolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border and a small  painless  erythematous lesion over his left index finger. Initial investigations showed leukocytosis with predominance of neutrophils and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Due to the presence of these signs together with ongoing fever and vascular phenomena  infective endocarditis was suspected.  In order to confirm this suspicion  he was sent for an echocardiography  which revealed significant vegetations on the aortic valve. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  In light of his identified condition  the chronic underlying factors  lifestyle choices  and family history  a comprehensive interdisciplinary treatment approach has been pitched to the healthcare team to manage his case. This will involve antimicrobial therapy  close hemodynamic monitoring  strict blood glucose management  aggressive lifestyle modifications  and consultations with a cardiologist for possible valve replacement surgery.
14,9,37,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial37,Case Presentation:  The patient under discussion is a middle-aged man  Mr. L  aged 55  of Hispanic ethnicity who has been diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. He comes from a low-income family  lives in a suburban neighbourhood  and has a history of intravenous drug use. His family history indicates a late father due to coronary artery disease and an older brother currently living with diabetes.   Past Medical History: Mr. L has a history of inconsistent treatment for Hepatitis C and has had two episodes of pneumonia in the last 5 years. He had experienced recurrent infections on and off due to unsafe drug use practices. He is also on prescribed opioids for chronic back pain due to a construction site injury 10 years ago. There is no history of previous surgeries.   Presenting Symptoms: He presented with a three-week history of low-grade fever  weight loss  night sweats  chills  and general malaise. Recent complaints of difficulty breathing  intermittent chest pain  and palpitations were also reported. On physical examination  Mr. L appeared unwell  fatigued and seemed malnourished. He also displayed Osler's nodes on the fingers  petechial rashes and exhibited Janeway lesions indicative of infective endocarditis.  Diagnostic Evaluation: Blood cultures were obtained that confirmed the diagnosis of infective endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. An echocardiogram showed vegetations on the tricuspid valve  further substantiating the diagnosis. The recently developed chest discomfort and palpitations prompted a cardiology consult. Electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST-T wave changes  but no overt signs of ischemia or past myocardial infarction.   Treatment: Mr. L was immediately started on empirical antibiotic therapy  which was then tailored according to the sensitivity pattern of the cultured organism. In view of his poor nutritional status  he was also put on a rehabilitative diet. Cardiology recommended regular monitoring with no requirement for surgical intervention at this stage.  Summary: This case emphasizes the fact that intravenous drug use remains a significant risk factor for infective endocarditis despite recent breakthroughs in managing commonly associated conditions such as HIV and Hepatitis C. Optimal outcomes would require a multidimensional approach addressing not only the infection but also associated issues such as addiction  mental health and lifestyle changes.

Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of moderate-to-severe Rheumatic heart disease  diagnosed 15 years ago  which remained largely stable since then. He's also known to have type 2 diabetes mellitus but maintains a well-controlled blood glucose level through dietary modifications and oral medication. He is a former smoker  with a 30 pack-year history  who quit 10 years ago. He has no known drug allergies.  Family History: Both parents were diagnosed with coronary artery disease in their late 60s. The father had Type 2 diabetes  and his mother had hypertension. He has no siblings. His 35-year-old son was recently diagnosed with juvenile-onset diabetes.  On examination: Vital signs showed a heart rate of 102 bpm  blood pressure: 137/84 mm Hg  respiratory rate: 16 breaths/min  and temperature: 38.6 C (101.5 F). Heart examination indicated a new murmur versus prior examinations.   Investigations: A series of blood cultures over the course of 2 days demonstrated growth of Streptococcus viridans. ECG findings were normal sinus rhythm with no ST or T wave changes. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. An echocardiogram was performed that showed moderate mitral regurgitation and a new oscillating intracardiac mass on the aortic or mitral valve  or on the supporting structures  or in the path of regurgitant jets  or on implanted material in the absence of an alternative anatomical explanation.  Diagnosis: Based on these findings  John Doe was diagnosed with Native-valve infective endocarditis.  Discussion: Taking into consideration Mr. Doe's past history of Rheumatic heart disease and the above clinical findings  there seems a clear association between underlying heart diseases and infective endocarditis. Untreated  this condition can result in severe complications  including heart failure. Hence  early identification and treatment are crucial.  Plan: Mr. Doe will be immediately started on a high-dose intravenous antibiotic regimen which includes penicillin and gentamicin  with the possibility of valve replacement surgery being discussed if the condition does not improve. His clinical progress needs to be regularly monitored through ECG  blood tests  and echocardiograms.   Education: Patient and family will be educated about the seriousness of the condition  the requirement for medication compliance  regular follow-ups  and to look out for any new symptom manifestation such as shortness of breath  chest pain  cough  or other symptoms of heart failure.   Follow up: Mr. Doe should have a repeat echocardiogram and blood cultures in two weeks to check the response to the therapy. His diabetic status should be closely watched in light of this newly diagnosed infective endocarditis.
14,9,41,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial41,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. J  is a 56-year-old Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug use who presented to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath  fatigue  and intermittent sweats for the past couple of weeks. He has not visited a doctor recently due to his lack of insurance access.  Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of hepatitis C and recurrent skin abscesses associated with IV drug use. Mr. J has been in and out of rehabilitative programs with limited success. He is currently unemployed and lives alone.   Family History:  Mr. J’s father had a history of ischemic heart disease  and his mother was diagnosed with diabetes. His sister has no significant medical history  and his brother died of a drug overdose in his 40s.  Examination Details:  Physical examination revealed a man in mild distress. He was febrile (temperature at 38.7°C)  tachycardic (heart rate: 112 bpm)  tachypneic (respiration rate: 22 breaths per min)  and his blood pressure measured at 130/80 mm Hg. On auscultation  a systolic murmur was appreciated at the left sternal border. Skin examination showed multiple old injection sites but no fresh abscesses.   Lab Results:   A full blood count showed leukocytosis (WBC: 14.5 x 10^9/L) with a left shift  and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR: 40 mm/h). The patient was HIV negative but had a positive test for hepatitis C. Three sets of blood cultures drawn 30 minutes apart came back positive for MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).  Imaging Results:   Transesophageal echocardiography showed vegetation on the tricuspid valve consistent with infective endocarditis.  Case Discussion:  Given the patient's past medical history of intravenous drug use and the physical examination finding of a new murmur  the working diagnosis became infective endocarditis  which was finally confirmed by positive blood cultures and imaging. The patient was started on appropriate antibiotics as per guidelines for MRSA-related endocarditis following Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).   Management:  Early valve replacement cannot be recommended immediately due to ongoing drug abuse and concern for prosthetic valve infection  which requires a broad discussion with medical  surgical  psychiatric  and social work teams. The patient will need close follow-up  ongoing antimicrobial treatment  harm reduction strategies  addressing social determinants of health  and drug rehabilitation.   This case presents an opportunity to highlight the intersection of significant medical pathology with complex psychosocial quandaries commonly seen in individuals with substance use disorders.

Family History:  Mr. Jones' father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 75 and his mother died at the age of 79 from complications related to stroke. He has one brother aged 63 years who has coronary artery disease (CAD). There is no known family history of autoimmune or congenital heart illnesses.  Hospital Course:  On admission  his temperature was 38.8°C  blood pressure was 132/78 mmHg  heart rate was 84 bpm  and respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. Physical examination revealed a new  grade II/VI diastolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds bilaterally. Mild peripheral edema was noted. No Osler's nodes  Roth's spots  or Janeway lesions were seen.  Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (white blood cell count: 15 000/microL) with left shift and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP: 56 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR: 65 mm/hr)  suggestive of systemic inflammation. Blood cultures were drawn  and three out of four bottles grew Streptococcus viridans within 24 hours. An echocardiogram revealed vegetations on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE). A diagnosis of native valve endocarditis was made  and intravenous vancomycin was commenced based on his allergic history and local bacterial resistance patterns.  The patient was managed by a team of cardiologists  infectious disease specialists  and endocrinologists. Over the course of the hospital stay  the patient's fever and systemic signs of infection gradually improved. Repeat blood culture showed no microbial growth after seven days of therapy. His DM was managed more aggressively to achieve better glycemic control. He was advised to quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption.  Inpatient education was provided about the symptoms of infective endocarditis and the importance of immediate care if symptoms recur. The patient and his family were also informed about the significance of good oral hygiene as preventable measure against infective endocarditis.  Mr. Jones was discharged after 4 weeks in good health. He is now on a six weeks course of antibiotics and will be closely followed up in the infectious disease and cardiology clinics.

Skin examination revealed tiny  painless red spots (Osler's nodes) on his palms and soles  and small  tender  red or purple pea-sized bumps under the skin (Janeway lesions).   Laboratory investigations showed elevated ESR and CRP levels  demonstrating active inflammation  while blood culture came positive for Staphylococcus aureus. An Echocardiogram revealed a vegetation on his native mitral valve with mild regurgitation.  Diagnosis:  With clinical  laboratory  and echocardiographic findings  Mr. Doe was diagnosed with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis.  Treatment and Follow-up:   Mr. Doe was immediately started on empirical antibiotics treatment with Oxacillin and Gentamicin. His home medications including oral hypoglycemic were continued. He is advised close follow-ups for monitoring his symptomatic relief  inflammatory markers  renal function  and cardiac function. He was also referred to the cardiology department for further evaluation and possible surgical intervention depending on his response to antibiotic treatment.  Educational Counseling:  Mr. Doe was educated about the critical nature of his illness  the importance of strict medication adherence  and the need for prophylactic antibiotics before any future dental or surgical procedure. He was encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene and manage his Diabetes effectively to prevent complications.  In conclusion  patients with a history of heart diseases and uncontrolled diabetes can  like Mr. Doe  be at a higher risk of developing an infection such as Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis. Therefore  it is critical to educate such patients about signs and symptoms of Infective Endocarditis and the importance of maintaining good overall health as part of their preventative care.
14,9,44,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial44,Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. X who presents with a few weeks of intermittent high spiking fevers  malaise  and unintended weight loss of about five kilograms. The patient lives with his wife. He is a retired teacher and does not smoke  consume alcohol  or have any illicit drug use. His only travel history was a recent visit to a farm where he does volunteer work on weekends.  Past Medical History: Mr. X has a history of bicuspid aortic valve disease diagnosed about ten years ago. A recent echocardiogram indicated moderate regurgitation but no stenosis. Besides  he has well-controlled hypertension on Lisinopril and hyperlipidemia maintained under control with Atorvastatin. Mr. X has no known history of rheumatic fever or Kawasaki disease. He has had no surgical procedures on his heart.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. X has been complaining of fatigue and bouts of fever over the past three weeks. He also reported poor appetite and unexplained weight loss. His wife noticed paleness and his fingertips have been looking blueish.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  the patient looked pale  mildly febrile (37.8℃) with an elevated heart rate (95 bpm)  and blood pressure was under control 130/85 mmHg. The cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border. Blood work showed mild anemia and slight leucocytosis. Mr. X's chest X-ray did not indicate any abnormalities.   Diagnosis: Based on his symptoms and signs  an infection was suspected  and three sets of blood cultures were drawn to rule out bacteremia. The cultures later revealed growth of Streptococcus viridans  suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis. Further confirmation was made by a transthoracic echocardiogram  which disclosed oscillating intracardiac mass on the aortic valve.  Family History: Mr. X's father had heart disease and died in his late 60s from a myocardial infarction; his mother is still alive with controlled hypertension. He has three siblings; one brother has adult-onset diabetes.  Treatment Plan: Mr. X was admitted to the hospital and commenced on IV antibiotics as per the sensitivity profile of the cultured organism. Alongside  counseling about the importance of adhering to his medications as prescribed  possible complications  and the necessity for regular follow-ups was provided.  Discussion: Native valve infective endocarditis is a rare but serious infection and must be identified and treated promptly. Mr. X's case illuminates the necessity for high clinical suspicion in patients with structural heart disease who present with non-specific symptoms like fever  fatigue  and weight loss. This case also emphasizes the importance of a collaborative multidisciplinary approach involving internists  cardiologists  and infectious disease specialists towards the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis.
14,9,45,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial45,Patient Case Presentation: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Demographics:  This case revolves around Mr. Sanchez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male who works as a mechanic. He lives with his wife in a semi-urban area. Mr. Sanchez is a nonsmoker  and he does not consume alcohol. He has no known allergies.  History of Present Illness: Mr. Sanchez presented to our outpatient clinic with a one-month history of intermittent fevers along with night sweats. He further complained of fatigue  unexplained weight loss  lesser appetite  and generalized body aches. He has noticed that over the past two weeks  his symptoms have progressively worsened.

The examination confirmed a persistently raised heart rate at 110 beats per minute  and his blood pressure was subnormal at 105/70 mmHg.  Past Medical History: Mr. Sanchez has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both of which he has managed for the past ten years with metformin and ramipril  respectively. He underwent appendectomy 25 years back.  Family History:  His father succumbed to myocardial infarction at the age of 72  and his mother is a known case of rheumatoid arthritis aged 88 years. Mr. Sanchez has one elder sister (70) who is reportedly healthy and one younger brother (64) suffering from type 2 diabetes and chronic renal disease.  Physical Examination: On auscultation  a pansystolic murmur was heard over the mitral area that radiated to the axilla. There were no clinical signs of peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis. Systemic examination revealed no abnormality; no splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy was found on abdominal examination.   Investigations: His initial investigations showed mild anemia (Hb 11.1 mg/dl) and an elevated white blood cell count (18 000 per microliter) with predominant neutrophils. His ESR was raised. Cardiac Troponin I was negative. His HbA1c was 6.5%. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus.   Echocardiography revealed an oscillating intracardiac mass on the native mitral valve  according to the modified Duke criteria. According to these results  he was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management Discussion: Mr. Sanchez was admitted to the hospital and initiated on empirical antibiotic therapy with prolonged intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and gentamicin. His diabetes was managed using sliding scale insulin due to hospitalization. His medication regimen was adjusted as per the blood culture findings.   In the absence of complications  a conservative approach was considered initially. However  surgical intervention might be required if the condition worsens  including the presence of cardiac failure  persistent infection or development of complications such as systemic emboli  persisting fever  or significant valve dysfunction like severe regurgitation leading to heart failure.  Patient education about the importance of optimal glycemic control  the need for strict adherence to antibiotic therapy  and regular follow-ups was emphasized. Furthermore  the risk of reinfection and preventive strategies were also discussed with the patient and his family.  Prognosis: The outcome of infective endocarditis varies according to the infecting microorganism  the cardiac and extracardiac complications  the patient's age  and the time of diagnosis. With early aggressive antibiotic therapy  durability can be achieved; however  there is a definite risk associated with potential complications that may require surgical intervention.     This case illustrates the challenges and considerations in the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis  a potentially life-threatening infection of the cardiac endocardium and valves.  Note: Infective endocarditis generally has an insidious course and can present atypically like this case where the predominant symptoms were constitutional. Hence  it is important to have a high degree of clinical suspicion for timely diagnosis and management to avoid complications.
14,9,46,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial46,Patient Profile: Mr. John Doe  a 72-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department with complaints of fatigue  unintended weight loss  low-grade fever  and night sweats persisting over the past three to four weeks. He also reported experiencing shortness of breath upon exertion and occasional chest discomfort during the same period. Mr. Doe  a retired construction worker currently living with his wife  has no children. He drank moderately until his forties and has never smoked.  Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus twelve years ago. His medical treatment includes the anti-hypertensive medication  hydrochlorothiazide  and the oral hypoglycemic agent  metformin. He has a history of poor adherence to his medications. Five years ago  he underwent an operation for a herniated disc for which he completed a course of antibiotics. His last dental visit had been over a year ago due to his fear of dentists.  Family History: His father died at the age of 76 due to stroke. His mother  who passed away at age 82  had a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His younger brother succumbed to myocardial infarction at a relatively young age of 65. He does not have any family history of heart valve diseases.  Clinical Assessment: On examination  he appeared lethargic and underweight. Oral examination revealed multiple untreated cavities. His body temperature was slightly raised at 100.2°F. Heart Auscultation disclosed a diastolic murmur along the left lower sternal border. Laboratory tests showed an elevated ESR  CRP  and white blood cell count implying a possible ongoing infection. EKG showed occasional premature ventricular contractions.   Investigations and Diagnosis: A Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) showed visible vegetation on the aortic valve with moderate regurgitation  leading to the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Blood cultures were then taken  which subsequently came back positive for Streptococcus viridans. The need for aggressive antibiotic treatment was promptly recognized.  Management: The patient was admitted to the cardiology unit  and IV antibiotic therapy was started (penicillin with gentamicin). He was also listed for dental clearance once medically stable. A multi-disciplinary approach involving cardiologist  endocrinologist  and dentist was suggested to manage his condition effectively.  In the case of Mr. Doe  his poor dental hygiene  inadequate management of his diabetes  and not adhering to medications have contributed to the development of infective endocarditis. This case emphasizes the importance of regular dental check-ups  good oral hygiene  and the management of risk factors like diabetes and hypertension.
14,9,47,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial47,Patient Presentation:  Mr. R is a 58-year-old Caucasian male and a retired carpenter  who presents complaints of fever  fatigue  and loss of appetite. He has a background history of rheumatic fever during his childhood  which he reports wasn’t managed adequately due to lack of medical facilities in his region. He is known to suffer from hypertensive heart disease  which was diagnosed five years ago. He has stopped smoking last year but has a 30-year-long history of about 10-cigarette/day smoking. He denies illicit drug use. In his family history  his father died of a heart attack at the age of 67 and his mother had a stroke at the age of 75.   Clinical Findings:  On examination  Mr. R's temperature is 38.5ºC  and he has a systolic murmur best heard at the apex radiating to the left axilla. There are no visible signs of sepsis. His teeth seem poorly maintained with visible signs of decay.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  To investigate his fever and heart murmur  a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed  which showed an oscillating intracardiac mass on one of his heart valves. A further transesophageal echocardiogram also noted major criteria suggestive of infective endocarditis - two separate positive blood cultures plus an echocardiogram consistent with endocarditis showing a vegetation measuring 2 cm on the mitral valve. Mr. R's blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans  commonly associated with dental infections. Based on the Modified Duke’s Criteria  a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was made.   Management and Follow-up:  Mr. R was immediately started on empirical antibiotic therapy for native-valve infective endocarditis – intravenous Penicillin G and Ceftriaxone. After confirming the Streptococcus viridans from blood culture  the treatment protocol continued for 4 weeks. His fever subsided within the first week and his appetite improved. Shared suggestions for better dental hygiene and given him a referral for dental consultation.   At a one-month follow-up visit  a repeat echocardiogram showed a marked decrease in the size of the vegetation. Mr. R reported feeling much better  and no longer experienced episodes of fever. In subsequent follow-up appointments  he will be closely monitored for any symptoms of heart failure  which could indicate the damage to the mitral valve. His blood pressure was well controlled and keeping with his hypertensive heart disease  he was continued on his usual antihypertensive medication. Also  he was advised to quit smoking entirely for the prevention of other cardiovascular diseases.
14,9,48,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial48,Patient Profile: The patient is a 61-year-old male  Mr. X  born and brought up in Seattle. He is Caucasian  a business consultant by profession  and married with two adult children.  Medical History: There is an unremarkable past medical history apart from periodic instances of hypertension and occasional episodes of high cholesterol. He has had no prior surgeries or known allergies. He is a non-smoker and consumes moderate alcohol on social events. He has had no past history of intravenous drug usage.

He denied chest pain  cough  abdominal pain  orthopnea  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  lower leg swelling or any recent procedures. He traveled to South Asia for a business meeting six weeks prior.   Physical Examination: On examination  the patient appeared tachypneic and slightly dyspneic but was able to speak in full sentences. There was a faint systolic regurgitant murmur heard best at the cardiac apex. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Investigations and Diagnosis: A complete blood count showed mild anemia  elevated WBC count  and the patient had an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Blood cultures returned positive for Streptococcus bovis. The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a mobile echogenicity on the mitral valve with significant regurgitation suggestive of infective endocarditis.   Plan: The diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis was established as per the Duke’s Criteria and a cardiology consult was obtained. Intravenous antibiotics with combination therapy of Ceftriaxone and Gentamicin were promptly started. Lifelong penicillin prophylaxis would be needed for future surgical or dental procedures. He was briefed about the need for critical follow-ups to track the effectiveness of the treatment and any potential valvular complications. The patient should be evaluated for colorectal carcinoma as well  given the Streptococcus bovis bacteremia.   In this case  it can be concluded that comprehensive understanding of patient history  symptoms and prompt investigations led to a timely diagnosis  which is crucial for managing life-threatening conditions such as infective endocarditis. The proposed plan addresses not only the immediate treatment but also long term prophylaxis and related conditions.

She denies any use of tobacco  drugs  or alcohol. Ms. Angela is religiously devout and a pillar of her community.  Past Medical History She has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 diagnosed about four years ago  which is controlled with metformin and a regulated diet. Apart from occasional episodes of hypertension  her medical history is unremarkable. She has no known allergies. She also has a history of dental cavities and has undergone regular dental procedures through the years.  Presenting Complaint Ms. Angela presents with intermittent fever  fatigue  shortness of breath for two weeks  and most recently  discomfort in her chest. She also notes unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 lbs in the last month and has been feeling generally unwell.  Family History Her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 64  while her mother  age 82  is alive and has Alzheimer’s disease. Her sibling  a brother  is aged 62 and has diagnosed with prostate cancer.   Physical Examination  On general inspection  she looked pale and tired but was alert and oriented in time  place  and person. Her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 145/90  a temperature of 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit  a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 94% while breathing ambient air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a diastolic murmur. Teeth were in poor condition  with visible signs of infections.  Working Diagnosis & Investigations Based on her symptoms  physical examination  poor dental hygiene  and high-risk history (Diabetes  HTN)  we suspected a case of native valve infective endocarditis. We requested a blood culture  full blood count  inflammatory markers such as ESR and C-reactive protein  ECG  and echocardiogram.   Outcome of Investigations and Diagnosis Investigations revealed anemia  elevated ESR and CRP strongly suggestive of an infection. Echocardiography revealed vegetation on the mitral valve suggestive of infective endocarditis. Blood cultures came back positive for Streptococcus oralis  fitting with her dental source of infection.  Management  The patient was admitted to hospital for Intravenous antibiotic therapy as per guidelines for Streptococcus oralis endocarditis. The Medical team liaised with Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery given the severe mitral regurgitation seen in the echo. Her Diabetes and Hypertension control were optimized during her inpatient stay. They also liaised with oral health for further management for her poor dental health condition.  This case highlights the importance of understanding the association between poor dental health and other systemic infections like infective endocarditis. Given her high-risk conditions  close follow-ups will be needed to ensure the success of her long-term recovery.
14,9,50,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial50,Patient Profile:  Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  named Mr. X  hailing from a suburban locale. He is a retired mechanic and has a history of excessive alcohol intake and smoking. He is currently living with his wife  who reports that he has been relatively healthy with no significant medical history until now.  Past Medical History:  He has a history of moderate hypertension  controlled with diet and medication. In addition to this  the patient has a known history of a murmur  owing to a mildly stenotic aortic valve. However  he has been asymptomatic so far and no intervention was indicated. The patient has been a chronic smoker for the past 40 years and consumes alcohol occasionally. There are no known allergies to drugs or food.  Family History:  Mr. X’s family history includes a father who passed away due to a heart attack at age 70 and a mother who was hypertensive and died from stroke-related complications. His elder brother  aged 68  has well-controlled type 2 diabetes.  Current Medical Issue:  Mr. X presented to the emergency department complaining of a two-week history of intermittent fever  malaise  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss. He reports having a poor appetite  but denies any nausea  vomiting  or changes in bowel habits. On physical examination  his blood pressure was noted to be 140/90 mmHg  heart rate 100 beats per minute  and temperature 38.5°C. He also had a new cardiac murmur with Osler’s nodes present on his hands and feet.  Investigations undertaken:  Based on his symptoms and physical examination findings  infective endocarditis was suspected. Blood tests were immediately ordered  and three sets of blood cultures were drawn. Echocardiogram revealed the presence of vegetations on his aortic valve confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment:  Immediate intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated in the form of vancomycin  after obtaining blood and tissue samples for culture and sensitivity.  Case Discussion:  Mr. X’s history of aortic stenosis put him at a higher risk for native valve endocarditis  likely further influenced by his smoking and alcohol habits. His symptoms were classic for endocarditis and an immediate investigation was ordered. The timely diagnosis and treatment initiation are crucial in the management  as the disease can rapidly progress resulting in valve damage and systemic embolic events. The team will closely monitor the patient's response to antibiotics and decide if surgical intervention will be needed.  This case underlines the importance of early suspicion and diagnosis of infective endocarditis in patients presenting with fever and murmur  especially those with a background of valvular heart diseases. Strict adherence to prophylactic measures pre-dental or other invasive procedures is necessary in such high-risk individuals.

14,9,52,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial52,Patient Case Presentation  Patient Information:  Mr. J is a 68-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department with complaints of fever  fatigue  loss of appetite  and weight loss over the past four weeks. The patient was living independently and had a history of smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the last 40 years  but quit smoking 10 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially and denies any illicit drug use. His diet is noted to be generally balanced  with no specific dietary restrictions. He is retired and was leading a sedentary lifestyle.  Medical History:  Mr. J has a documented history of succumbing to Type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 8 years  rheumatic fever in childhood  and had a gallbladder removal due to chronic cholecystitis two years ago. He has been relatively compliant with his oral hypoglycemic agent treatment and controlling his diabetes with regular check-ups. No history of hospitalization for any major illness was noted in the past decade except for his gallbladder surgery.  Family History:  His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 72 while his mother died at 85 due to Alzheimer's disease. His eldest brother is diagnosed with coronary artery disease while his youngest sister has been living with rheumatoid arthritis.  Presenting Complaints and Physical Exam:  On presentation  Mr. J was febrile with a temperature of 38.7 degrees Celsius. He looked fatigued and appeared to be anorexic to some extent. Cardiovascular exam revealed a diastolic murmur heard best at the left sternal edge which was suggestive of valvular pathology. A blood culture showed the growth of Streptococcus mutans. An Echocardiogram revealed a mobile echogenic mass on the mitral valve suggestive of a vegetation  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. He was promptly started on empiric antibiotic treatment.  Conclusion:  Mr. J’s history of rheumatic fever in his childhood indicates an increased risk for valvular heart disease  which in turn predisposes him to the development of infective endocarditis. His presentation  physical exam  and diagnostic tests confirm this diagnosis. Going forward  the management would include targeted antibiotic therapy and a thorough assessment of the need for potential surgical intervention for the infected valve. Additionally  improving Mr. J’s lifestyle and managing his diabetes in a more stringent fashion could be critical in a holistic approach to his health  given his age  predisposed conditions  and confirmed infective endocarditis diagnosis.
14,9,53,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial53,Patient: Mr. R.W.  Demographics: 65-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Complaint: Fever  fatigue  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss.  Past Medical History: 1. Chronic Rheumatoid Arthritis - Diagnosed 10 years ago  is on Methotrexate. 2. Hypertension - Diagnosed 15 years ago  well-controlled with medication. 3. Past smoker - Quit smoking 20 years ago. 4. History of recreational drug use during his 20s.  Family History: Father died of myocardial infarction in his early 70s  mother suffers from Type II Diabetes. He has one older brother in good health.  Clinical Examination: The patient appeared cachectic  displayed clubbing of fingers and had a heart murmur. Blood pressure found to be within normal range. Temperature was elevated (38.8°C). No evidence of any skin rashes  petechiae  or Osler's nodes.  Investigations: Blood Tests - Raised ESR and C-reactive protein levels. Echocardiogram - Showed vegetative growth on the mitral valve. Blood cultures - Confirmed Staphylococcus aureus in blood. No evidence of any secondary complications such as abscess formation or systemic infarctions.  Diagnosis: Given the clinical findings of persistent fever  cardiac murmur  vascular phenomena  weight loss  positive blood culture  and evidence of endocardial involvement on echocardiography  Mr. R.W. was diagnosed with Native Valve Infective Endocarditis.  Management: 1. IV antibiotic treatment as per IDSA guidelines (6 weeks course) 2. Lifelong follow-up to monitor heart functions 3. Advice regarding good dental hygiene  as poor dental health may lead to endocarditis 4. Regular follow-up for rheumatoid arthritis with the rheumatologist   This case highlights the fact that even well-controlled  hypertensive patients can develop infective endocarditis  especially when they have a past history of recreational drug use and are on immunosuppressive drugs for other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. The above mentioned are significant risk factors for the disease. It should also be noted that chronic inflammatory conditions may blunt the classic symptoms of fever and thus  the diagnosis of infective endocarditis can be delayed. Therefore  a high degree of clinical suspicion is warranted in managing these patients.
14,9,54,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial54,Patient Presentation:  Mr. L  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted with complaints of persistent  intermittent fevers and unexplained weight loss over the past two months. He has a history of type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and prior oral surgery three months ago. Family history reveals a father who passed away from a myocardial infarction at 75 and a mother living with Alzheimer's disease. He is a retired teacher  smokes occasionally  and drinks alcohol socially.   Upon presentation  vital signs included a fever of 38.7 Celsius  heart rate of 105 bpm  respiratory rate of 19 per minute  BP 150/90 mmHg  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. His physical examination revealed Janeway lesions on his palms and soles  Osler's nodes on his fingers  and a new high-pitched diastolic murmur heard best at the cardiac apex.   Investigations:  Inflammatory markers were elevated; WBC count of 15.0 x 10^9/L  CRP 60mg/L  and ESR 40mm/hr. His blood glucose level was within normal limits  adjusting for his history of diabetes. A full set of blood culture was positive for Streptococcus viridans. An EKG demonstrated nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes but no signs of ischemia or infarction. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed vegetations on the mitral valve  corroborating the suspicions of infective endocarditis (IE).   Management:  Mr. L was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with a combination of Penicillin G and Gentamicin  tailored once blood cultures identified the streptococcus species. Glycemic control was managed with metformin and regular insulin as needed. Measures were taken to control the blood pressure and maintain it within normal limits.   Plan:  This patient will require close monitoring and long-term antibiotic therapy to treat the endocarditis  with a minimum treatment duration generally of six weeks. Surgery may be needed if there is persistent infection  heart failure due to valvular dysfunction  systemic emboli or there is development of heart block or abscess. Cardiovascular and infection disease team consultations were sought  and a plan was made for follow-up after discharge to monitor the recovery and manage any potential complications.  Education:  Patient education was provided about the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene and seeking immediate dental consult for any future oral procedures due to his increased risk of recurring IE. The patient was also advised to quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption to further lower his cardiovascular risk.   This case highlights the need for early recognition and prompt treatment of IE  including consider the risk factors such as a recent dental procedure.

The patient also complains of new onset of shortness of breath. He has no prior known history of intravenous drug use  immunological diseases  or recent invasive medical procedures.  Past Medical History:  The patient had been previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2  controlled with metformin  and hypertension  controlled with hydrochlorothiazide. The patient also underwent aortic valve replacement five years ago. He has not received any dental work in the past year. His other past medical history includes hypercholesterolemia  for which he is taking atorvastatin.  Family History:  His father died at the age of 70 from a myocardial infarction  and his mother is 92-years-old with Alzheimer's. He has one younger brother with type 2 diabetes. There's no known family history of congenital heart disease or heart valve abnormality.  Clinical Examination:  Physical examination reveals a febrile patient (temperature 102°F)  with a blood pressure of 130/80mmHg  heart rate of 100 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 20 per minute. Cardiac examination reveals a systolic murmur best heard at the apex  along with signs of heart failure including increased jugular venous pressure  bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation  and mild bipedal edema.  Investigations:  Lab tests show increased levels of inflammatory markers (CRP  ESR)  mildly raised liver enzymes (ALT  AST) and mild hyperglycemia. Blood cultures confirm the presence of Streptococcus viridans infection. The Transesophageal echocardiogram shows a thickened mitral valve with vegetation suggestive of endocarditis.   Impression:  The clinical scenario and supporting laboratory data confirm a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. The picture is complicated by heart failure  likely secondary to valvular dysfunction due to infective endocarditis.  Plan:  The patient requires urgent hospitalization and treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Heart failure should be treated with diuretics  an ACE inhibitor  and beta-blockers. Given the patient's previous valve replacement  he will be evaluated by a cardiothoracic surgeon for possible valve replacement. A multidisciplinary approach  involving an Infectious Disease team  a Cardiologist and a Cardiothoracic surgeon  will be essential in managing this patient. 
14,9,56,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial56,Case Presentation:  Patient Information: Mr. Smith is a 60-year-old Caucasian male who was admitted due to recent onset of fatigue  chills  mild fever  night sweats  and unintended weight loss over the past two weeks.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has been previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  and currently manages these conditions with regular medication. He was previously a smoker  having quit 10 years ago. Mr. Smith received treatment for dental caries two months prior to his current symptoms. He has no history of illicit drug use.  Household and Family History: He lives with his wife in suburban Detroit. Two adult children are out-of-state. His family history is significant for coronary artery disease in his father  who died before the age of 60  and diabetes in his mother.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  he appeared chronically ill. His temperature was 38.3 degrees Celsius. He had a systolic heart murmur in the aortic area  consistent with an aortic regurgitation curtain sign. Splinter hemorrhages were observed under some nails  and Janeway lesions were detected on the soles of his feet. His remaining physical examination  including the rest of the cardiovascular exam  was unremarkable.   Laboratory Data: Blood counts revealed slight anemia  elevated ESR suggesting systemic inflammation. His blood cultures revealed growth of Streptococcus viridans.   Imaging: A subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram with bubble study revealed vegetations with aortic valve regurgitation and a patent foramen ovale (PFO)  suggestive of paradoxical embolism.   Diagnosis: Based on his clinical presentation  blood culture results  and echocardiographic findings  he was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.   Plan: Mr. Smith was begun on intravenous penicillin and gentamicin as per the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines. Given his infringement on diagnostic Duke's Criteria for infective endocarditis  as well as the presence of PFO - rheumatology and cardiac surgery were involved for potential valve replacement surgery and PFO closure. The patient's oral health was also to be managed to prevent future episodes.  This case highlights the importance of maintaining high clinical suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients presenting with systemic symptoms  especially in those with recent dental procedures  since early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for preventing severe complications.

Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  her temperature was 38.2°C  blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg  heart rate of 95 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. A cardiovascular examination revealed a new systolic murmur best heard at the mitral area. Labs showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)  and mild anemia.  Diagnosis: Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed echogenic material on the mitral valve leaflet  indicative of vegetation  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus mutans  that's consistent with the diagnosis.  Treatment plan: The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics  as per the guidelines for Streptococcus mutans endocarditis; Penicillin G and Gentamicin for a synergy effect. She was also ordered for daily complete blood counts and renal function monitoring due to the potential adverse effects of antibiotic treatment. A follow-up Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was planned to evaluate the response to therapy.  Discussion: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe infection of the endocardium  heart valves or a cardiac device. The clinical presentation can vary from nonspecific signs and symptoms including fever  weakness  and fatigue to severe systemic illness. Despite advances in diagnosis  antimicrobial therapy  surgical techniques  and management of complications  infective endocarditis still carries substantial morbidity and mortality. This case fortifies the importance of early detection and management of the condition to improve patient outcomes.

Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) shows vegetation on the mitral valve consistent with endocarditis. Diagnostic criteria of infective endocarditis are fulfilled according to DUKE's criteria (1 major: positive blood culture; 3 minors: fever  vascular phenomena: Janeway lesion  predisposing heart condition or IV drug use).  Management Plan: The patient is immediately started on appropriate antibiotics to combat the infection identified in the blood culture. He will need long-term IV antibiotics  ideally for at least 4-6 weeks. The Infectious Disease team is brought on board. Cardiology has evaluated the patient as well but does not feel surgical intervention is necessary at this juncture given the smaller size of the vegetation and lack of significant valve dysfunction observed on TEE.  Psychosocial Aspects: The patient's social support is scarce. His drug abuse history and inconsistent medical care access makes the successful administration of long-term treatment challenging. He is connected to an Addiction Medicine specialist for help with his IV drug use.  Prognosis: Currently stable but guarded  as the mortality rate for native valve infective endocarditis can be high  especially with history of IV drug use.  Patient Education: The patient is advised and educated on how proper nutrition  hygiene  avoiding IV drug use  and regular follow ups can help him recover from the current situation and maintain better health.  Follow Up: Scheduled for one week to observe the patient's response to medical therapy. Frequent blood cultures will be done to confirm clearance of bacteremia.  This case presents an example of how social determinants of health - like IV drug use and inconsistent access to healthcare - can have direct impacts on serious and life-threatening conditions  like infective endocarditis.
14,9,59,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial59,Patient's Information: Mr. X is a 64-year-old Caucasian male  a retired construction worker  and a resident of New York City  US. He is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. He has a history of poor dentition  which he never paid attention to. Mr. X's family's medical history is significant with his father dying due to a stroke and his mother having hypertension. He has no known allergies.  Chief Complaint: He came complaining of fever  fatigue  night sweats  and shortness of breath on exertion for the past two weeks.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes that was diagnosed ten years back  which is managed by oral hypoglycemic agents. He was previously identified with rheumatoid arthritis approximately seven years ago  which is under control by anti-rheumatic drugs.  Physical Examination and Diagnosis: On examination  the patient was febrile and appeared unwell. Heart auscultation revealed a new heart murmur. The results of the blood cultures yielded Streptococcus mutans  consistent with infective endocarditis. Echocardiography was performed which showed vegetations on the patient's native heart valves that were consistent with native-valve infective endocarditis. The laboratory report revealed elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels. As the arthritis and poor dental health are risk factors for his diagnosis  it is likely that Streptococcus mutans bacteremia originated from the oral cavity.  Management and Follow Up: Mr. X was immediately started on intravenous antibiotic therapy with Penicillin and Gentamicin. He was scheduled for regular echocardiograms to monitor his valve health over the course of treatment. Multidisciplinary teams  including cardiologists  infectious disease specialists  and potentially cardiothoracic surgeons  will collaborate in his management. If the patient doesn't show any sign of improvement  he might require surgical intervention.  His diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis treatment were adjusted to his new medications and overall health status. Then he was referred for a dental checkup for oral hygiene to prevent the recurrence of infective endocarditis. He was also counseled on the importance of oral hygiene and maintaining good control of blood sugars. His follow-up appointment was scheduled within two weeks to assess his progress.  This case demonstrates the importance of having a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients with new-onset fever  heart murmur  and cardiovascular risk factors  and the role of multidisciplinary teams in their management.
14,9,60,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial60,Patient Case Presentation: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Overview: The patient under consideration is a 65-year-old Caucasian male named  John Bingham. He was admitted due to a new onset of fever with associated chills  fatigue  and weight loss. He has been a smoker for the past 30 years but quit five years ago. He does not have a history of alcohol or illicit drug abuse.   Medical History: Mr. Bingham has a significant past medical history of Type II diabetes mellitus and Hypertension for the past 15 years  being managed with metformin and lisinopril respectively. Up until now  he has maintained fairly good control over both conditions as evident by his HbA1c levels and blood pressure readings. He has a history of a minor stroke three years ago with complete recovery.   Family History: He also has a positive family history of cardiovascular disease. Both of his parents died due to myocardial infarction in their mid-sixties.  Clinical Pertinent Findings: On clinical examination  he was found to have a diminished breath sound in the lung bases and a new cardiac murmur was detected. Neurological examination was normal. Laboratory tests revealed mild anemia and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and sedimentation rates). Blood cultures showed growth of Streptococcus viridans  and an echocardiogram demonstrated a vegetation on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Imaging: Chest X-ray was suggestive of mild congestive heart failure. Brain imaging did not reveal any focal brain lesions  excluding any septic emboli related to infective endocarditis.  Treatment: The patient has been started on appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy as per the sensitivity report of the causative organism. He has been referred to a cardiologist for consultation regarding the management of the mitral valve lesion and his overall cardiac condition. Also  NBC blood pressure and blood sugar parameters are to be tightly controlled in collaboration with the endocrinologist and physician.  This case sheds light on the importance of considering the diagnosis of infective endocarditis in a patient with a new murmur and signs of systemic infection  especially with relevant comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension. Future follow-ups should include monitoring response to treatment  cardiovascular outcomes  and overall patient health status.   Regular monitoring will become more critical as Mr. Bingham ages  considering his predisposing factors for his condition  namely his Type II diabetes mellitus  smoking history  and strong genetic predisposition to cardiac issues. Treatment should be a combination of pharmacological intervention and lifestyle modifications to manage existing issues and prevent further exacerbation.
14,9,61,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial61,Patient Information:  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male who was brought to the hospital by his daughter due to increasing bouts of fatigue  weakness and unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He also complained of nocturnal sweats and a low-grade fever. The patient resides in a small city in the Midwest and is a retired mechanic. He lives alone and smokes around ten cigarettes a day. He is a widower with two daughters  both of whom live in the same city.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of rheumatic fever in childhood and underwent mechanical mitral valve replacement 15 years ago due to severe mitral stenosis. He has been on lifelong warfarin therapy since the surgery. In addition  he has hypertension  which is controlled with losartan  and type 2 diabetes managed with metformin. He also has a history of heavy drinking but insists that he has been sober for the past ten years.   Family History:  His mother passed away at age 82 due to heart failure  and his father died from prostate cancer at age 75. His elder sister has hypertension and diabetes  and his younger brother passed away due to alcohol-related liver cirrhosis.   Presenting Problem: Upon admission  the patient was seen to have a fever of 101.2°F  heart rate of 108/min  and blood pressure 130/85 mmHg. A clinical exam revealed a new murmur. Laboratory tests showed an elevated white blood cell count  and blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Subsequent echocardiography highlighted vegetations on his native aortic valve  leading to the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Given his history of valve replacement and his new murmur  it was determined that his infective endocarditis was likely related to his past heart condition and its surgical treatment  with Staphylococcus aureus being a common causative agent in such cases.   The patient's significant tobacco use history and possible past alcohol abuse present additional risks for his condition. Despite his history of alcoholism  the patient vehemently affirms that he hasn't consumed alcohol for a decade.   Plan: The patient will be managed with intravenous antibiotics for the next 4-6 weeks  per the infectious disease team. Our cardiology consultants may also consider surgical valve replacement if the patient fails to respond to the antibiotics. He is being referred to a smoking cessation program to contribute towards his overall cardiac health. He also needs close monitoring of his blood glucose levels and possible adjustment of his metformin dosage. His warfarin dosage will require close supervision during his antibiotic course. His dietary intake needs to be managed closely due to his unintentional weight loss. The patient has been advised to maintain a regular follow-up schedule for his heart condition post-discharge.
14,9,62,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial62,Patient Presentation:  Mr. A  a 55-year-old male Caucasian  presents with a prolonged fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit  weakness  and weight loss for the past 3 weeks. The patient also mentioned experiencing night sweats and a decreased appetite.   Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of Rheumatic Fever at the age of 12 from which he recovered completely but resulted in mild mitral valve regurgitation. There are no other significant past illnesses. He is a non-smoker  drinks alcohol socially  and denies any drug usage. He has an episode of dental surgery for tooth extraction about a month ago.  Family History:  Family history is significant for early-onset coronary artery disease in his father  who passed away at 60 following a myocardial infarction. His mother has a history of hypertension. He has one brother  aged 59  with no known conditions.  Physical Exam:  Upon physical examination  his blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg  pulse rate is 96 per minute  respiratory rate is 20 per minute  and temperature is 102 F. Cardiac examination reveals a new pansystolic murmur heard best at the apex radiating towards the axilla. There are no Osler nodes  Janeway lesions  Roth spots  or splinter hemorrhages. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  Investigations:  Laboratory studies reveal leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils. His Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are found to be elevated  suggesting inflammation. Three sets of blood cultures are obtained which returned positive for Streptococcus viridans. Transthoracic echocardiogram shows vegetation on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of native valve infectious endocarditis.  Treatment Plan:  He is admitted and started on empiric antibiotic therapy with Ceftriaxone and Gentamicin under Cardiology and Infectious disease care. Regular follow-ups recommended.  Summary:  Mr. A's dental procedure is likely to have contributed to his native valve infective endocarditis  as S. viridans is a common oral flora. His past history of rheumatic fever and the resultant mitral regurgitation significantly increased his risk of developing infective endocarditis. Given the early-onset heart disease in the patient's father  it is also relevant to assess his cardiovascular risk profile and monitor him closely.
14,9,63,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial63,Patient Profile: The patient is a 65-year-old male with an extensive history of intravenous drug use. He is Caucasian and has been living in urban Auckland  New Zealand for about a decade. He sought medical attention due to persistent fever  severe joint and muscle pains  and fatigue. His family history is notable for a father who had coronary artery disease and a mother with hypertension.  Third Visit: The patient was initially seen three months ago for complaints of recurrent fever and was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with oral antibiotics. Despite completing the antibiotics course  the patient had persistent symptoms  and fatigue had considerably worsened.  Current Condition: His physical examination revealed a thin  malnourished gentleman  febrile at 38.5°C. His blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg. During cardiac auscultation  a diastolic murmur was noted. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable.  Investigations: Initial laboratory tests showed a high white blood cell count of 14 000. The patient was admitted to the hospital  and blood cultures were sent  which grew Streptococcus viridans. An echocardiogram was done showing evidence of mitral valve vegetations  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment Plan: The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics following an antibiogram  including Ceftriaxone and Gentamicin.   Follow-Up: A multi-disciplinary team  including infectious disease specialists and cardiologists  has been involved in the patient's care. Consultation with cardiac surgery was obtained to assess the need for potential valve surgery. The social work team is also involved to address the issues related to his intravenous drug use.  Prognosis: With proper treatment  the patient stands a good chance of recovery; however  the prognosis also depends on factors such as respond to treatment  progression of infection  potential cardiac complications  and cessation of drug usage.   This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for infective endocarditis in patients with recurrent fever  especially those with risk factors like IV drug use and a history of heart valve disease.    His detailed medical history  complete profile  and the results of his clinical history will be kept confidential in line with HIPAA regulations. The medical staff and doctors will continue to monitor the patient's progress to ensure optimal treatment and care.

Medical History:  Mr. Smith's past medical history reveals a diagnosis of Rheumatic Fever at age 12  but there was no recurrence later. He also underwent a dental procedure involving root canal treatment approximately four months ago. His other medical history includes hyperlipidemia  diagnosed 10 years ago  which is currently well controlled with medication. He had a history of smoking (1 pack/day) for the past 35 years but quit five years ago. He never uses drugs but drinks alcohol socially. He has no known allergies to medications.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination showed Mr. Smith had slightly pale skin  a low grade fever of 99.7°F  and a new diastolic murmur was noted on auscultation over the chest. There were small  tender  subcutaneous nodules in his fingers and conjunctival hemorrhages evident in his eyes  suspecting Osler's nodes and Roth's spots respectively. Lab findings showed elevated white cell count  ESR  and C-reactive protein  indicating ongoing inflammation within the body. Blood cultures were positive with Streptococcus viridans.  Family History:  His father passed away at age 82 due to a myocardial infarction. His mother  who is 88 years old  is currently living and has Diabetes Mellitus and Osteoporosis. His younger brother  61  has recently been diagnosed with Hypertension. There isn't any notable history of cardiac disease or malignancy in his immediate or extended family.  Diagnosis:  Based on these findings  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVE)  likely secondary to Streptococcal infection.  Treatment & Prognosis:  Mr. Smith was admitted to the cardiology department and commenced on antibiotics per the Infective Endocarditis guideline from the American Heart Association  with ensuing careful monitoring of his cardiac profile. The treatment plan includes a six weeks course of intravenous antibiotics. He is advised to follow up with his cardiologist after the completion of treatment. Echocardiogram and cardiac MRI will be scheduled on the follow-up visit to assess any possible valve damage and the need for valve replacement surgery.

14,9,65,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial65,Subject: Brief Case Presentation - Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  I. Patient Identifying Information  Our patient is Mr. Allen Thompson  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  a retiree living in Charlotte  North Carolina  married for the past 35 years and is a father to three healthy children.  II. Chief Complaint  Mr. Thompson presented with persistent fever of 38.5-degree Celsius  a sudden unexplained weight loss around 5 kg over the last month  shortness of breath  and fatigue that he initially attributed to age and a possible flu.  III. Past Medical History  Mr. Thompson has a significant past medical history of rheumatic heart disease since his late 20s which was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. He has a 15-year history of high blood pressure  managed by routine medication. There were two incidences of hospitalization due to myocardial infarction about a decade ago. He quit smoking and drinking immediately after his first heart attack. He does not have any history of diabetes or any surgical intervention done in the past.  IV. Family History  He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  both his father and grandfather succumbed to heart-related ailments in their late 60s. His mother died of breast cancer at the age of 70. His siblings are healthy and do not have any major chronic ailments.  V. Present Illness/ Hospital Course  On examination  he showed signs of cardiac murmurs appreciated upon auscultation  splinter hemorrhages were noticed under his fingernails  and petechiae were found on his anterior chest. Blood tests showed elevated ESR and C-reactive protein. Blood cultures were positive for streptococcus viridans. Visualization of valvular vegetation in echocardiography and presence of associated clinical signs confirmed the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  VI. Treatment and Progress  On diagnosis  aggressive antimicrobial therapy was initiated as per the standard protocol treating streptococcus viridans. The patient showed considerable improvement over the next few weeks. He will require a prolonged course of antibiotics for a full recovery. Consulting with cardiology  a decision has been deferred on surgical intervention until antibiotics are completed and revisit echo is done.  VII. Conclusion  Considering Mr. Thompson's age  past history of rheumatic heart disease  and myocardial infarction  he is at high risk for developing complications and aggravating further medical conditions. He would be required to attend regular follow-ups to ensure complete recovery and keep a tab on other associated risks.   Family support  his commitment to quit smoking and drinking  and compliance with the prescribed treatment  however  augur well for his recovery from this episode of native-valve infective endocarditis.   Note: Remember this is a fictional patient and presentation  you need to adjust this case presentation according to your real patient clinical presentation and condition.
14,9,66,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial66,Patient Presentation  Patient Information: Mr. Smith is a 64-year-old Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug use. He lives alone and was recently diagnosed with diabetes type II  which is poorly controlled.  Presenting Problem: He presented to the hospital with a fever of 101.5°F and general malaise lasting for a week. The patient reported experiencing episodes of dizziness and has been frequently short of breath lately.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a past medical history of Type-II Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension (HTN)  Hyperlipidemia (HLD)  prior dental abscesses  and opioid dependence with intravenous drug use. There is no known history of heart disease  though a heart murmur was observed 2 years ago. He was counselled about maintaining oral hygiene but showed non-compliance.  Family History: There is a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus in his immediate family. His father died of myocardial infarction at age 62  and his mother has been managing her diabetes for over 20 years.  Physical Examination: On presentation  his blood pressure was 132/88 mmHg  heart rate 98 bpm  and respiratory rate 16 bpm. The physical exam was significant for poor dentition  a new loud pansystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border  and peripheral stigmata of endocarditis including Janeway lesions on his palms and soles. There were track marks on his arms suggestive of intravenous drug use.  Investigation and Diagnosis: Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans. A subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed vegetation on the mitral valve confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management: The patient was initiated on intravenous antibiotics as recommended by guidelines for Streptococcus viridans  which includes a combination of Penicillin or Ceftriaxone and Gentamicin for synergistic therapy. He showed steady improvement with the ongoing antibiotic therapy. His antibiotic therapy was planned for a total of 4 to 6 weeks. Given his history of opioid dependence  his pain was managed with non-opioid painkillers.  Social History: Mr. Smith has had a long history of substance abuse  mainly opioids  for which he has been into rehab twice though the relapse rate is high. He has been in and out of jobs  mainly working in low-wage labor work. His support system is scanty with only a brother living far away.  Brief Summary: Mr. Smith is a 64-year-old male with a PMH of diabetes  hypertension  and intravenous drug use  now diagnosed with native valve endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans  likely due to poor dental hygiene and IV drug use. Active measures have been started to manage his current medical condition while a team of social support has been created to assist with his substance abuse problem and ensuring compliance with the treatment.

He is married with two children and has a 20 pack-year smoking history  but quit 5 years ago. He has no known drug or alcohol addictions.  Past Medical History: The patient was previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 and has been controlling it with diet and Metformin. In addition  he has a history of hypertension for which he has been on Lisinopril. The patient was successfully treated for H Pylori-induced gastric ulcer 3 years ago and has had no recurrences. He has had no surgeries or past hospitalizations.  Presentation: The patient presents complaining of intermittent fever  shortness of breath  fatigue  and weight loss over the past 6 weeks. He has also reported periodic night sweats and a lack of appetite.  Family History: His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 62 and his mother is alive at 81 with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and osteoporosis. His older brother is healthy  but his younger sister has rheumatoid arthritis.  Examination: On physical examination  the patient is conscious and oriented  appearing chronically ill. He shows signs of poor nutrition. He has a low-grade fever of 100.4°F and elevated blood pressure of 150/85 mmHg. Cardiovascular examination reveals a diastolic murmur in the aortic area.  Investigations: Blood tests show elevated ESR and CRP levels indicating inflammation. Hematology reveals slight anemia. His blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. A subsequent echocardiogram revealed thickening and vegetation of the mitral valve consistent with infective endocarditis. Chest X-ray showed no signs of pulmonary edema.  Diagnosis: The patient's symptoms  physical examination  and the results of blood cultures and echocardiography confirm a diagnosis of native valve endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus.  Management: The patient was admitted to the hospital for further treatment. IV antibiotic therapy was started with Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone. Surgery is strongly considered due to the persistent infection and his current dysfunctional cardiac state  especially given the risk of congestive heart failure or systematic embolization. The patient was further advised to maintain a balanced diet and exercise regime to help manage his diabetes and hypertension. Regular monitoring of his heart condition has been recommended.   Prognosis: With timely diagnosis and treatment  the prognosis for the patient can be optimistic  but there is a significant risk due to his underlying conditions and possible complications. The management of his diabetes and hypertension will significantly impact the prognosis of his endocarditis.   Health promotion: The patient was advised to undertake lifestyle modifications  particularly involving diet and physical activity  to better manage his diabetes and hypertension  which have indirect impacts on his endocarditis condition.  Risk factors: The primary risk factors for this patient are his pre-existing diabetes and hypertension condition along with poor nutritional status. His family history brings attention to the possible genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease.
14,9,68,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial68,Patient Presentation:   Patient:  Mr. X  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the hospital with severe fatigue  persistent fever  and heart palpitations.  History of Present Illness:  Mr. X is a retired construction worker who lives with his wife and has two adult children. He reports feeling generally unwell for the past three weeks  with symptoms including generalized malaise  intermittent fevers reaching 101°F  and night sweats. He also reports increasing fatigue which he initially attributed to his age and recent gardening activities. He started experiencing an unusual heart flutter about a week ago which has been occurring sporadically  making him very uncomfortable. He visited his GP who referred him to the hospital due to his suggestive symptoms.  Past Medical and Social History:   Mr. X has a history of moderate mitral regurgitation  diagnosed ten years ago. He is also a reformed smoker who quit smoking about 5 years ago after a 40-pack-year history and has no history of illicit drug use. He consumes alcohol occasionally  only drinking wine at family gatherings. His father had coronary artery disease and died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. His mother is alive and has type II diabetes mellitus.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  he appeared lethargic but was oriented to time  place  and person. Temperature of 100.6°F  blood pressure 130/80mmHg  heart rate 110bpm  and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular examination revealed a blistering murmur best heard at the left sternal border. Few petechiae were also seen on the palmar surface of the hands and soles of the feet.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Initial blood tests showed elevated inflammatory markers - ESR  CRP  and leukocytosis. Blood cultures were taken and were positive with Streptococcus viridans. ECG showed atrial fibrillation and echocardiogram revealed vegetations on the mitral valve consistent with infective endocarditis. The diagnosis of infective endocarditis was established and a consultation with the infectious disease and cardiology team was placed.  Management:  The patient was kept in hospital for intravenous antibiotics according to the sensitivity pattern of the blood cultures. The possibility of valve surgery was being discussed depending on the response to medical management.  Discussion:  The patient's symptoms along with his past history of mitral regurgitation  the discovery of a new murmur  positive blood cultures and vegetations on echocardiogram  matched the modified Duke’s criteria for infective endocarditis. His lifestyle or hobbies did not seem to instigate this manifestation but his pre-existing valvular heart disease is a noted risk factor. His familial history of CAD could play a role in his overall cardiac health and risk  but it currently appears unconnected to his diagnosis.   Close monitoring of his illness course is mandatory to prevent complications such as heart failure  systemic embolization  or persistent bacteremia which may require urgent valve replacement surgery. Autologous reconstruction may be an option for him as his native-valve is infected and he does not have any other systemic infection. He was also started on anticoagulants for the atrial fibrillation and will be required to continue them unless contraindications present. Furthermore  reinforcement of the importance of dental hygiene was given as Streptococcus viridans is commonly found in the oral cavity.
14,9,69,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial69,Chief Complaint:  A 54-year-old man presents with complaints of persistent fever  night sweats  and unexplained weight loss for the past three weeks.   History of Present Illness: The patient reports a persistent high-grade fever that responds minimally to over-the-counter medicine along with night sweats. He also reports an unintentional loss of 6 kgs over the last month. He initially attributed these symptoms to workload stress but became concerned as his symptoms are persisting and affecting his day-to-day activities. There's no associated cough  chest pain  vomiting  or diarrhea.  Past Medical History: The patient's health history includes hypertension  for which he is on antihypertensive medication  and a 20-year history of intravenous drug abuse. No history of any surgeries or allergies.  Social History:  The patient is a smoker  with approximately 30-pack-years. He consumes alcohol occasionally but is only a social drinker. He is a bachelor and lives alone. He is a construction worker.  Family History:  Family history is positive for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. No history of infectious diseases or heart-related illnesses in the family.   Physical Examination:  On physical examination  the patient appeared slightly pale. His blood pressure was 140/90  heart rate 105 beats/min  temperature 38.4 C  and respiratory rate 16 breaths/min. Cardiovascular examination revealed a diastolic murmur heard loudest along the left lower sternal border. There were no Janeway lesions or Osler nodes noted. The other system examinations were within normal limits.  Investigations:  Blood tests reveal anemia  elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate)  and slightly impaired renal function. Blood cultures were drawn which came back positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Transthoracic and subsequent transesophageal echocardiography were performed due to suspicion of endocarditis which confirmed vegetation on the tricuspid valve.  Diagnosis: The diagnostic findings were consistent with a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management and Follow-up:  The patient was hospitalized and given relevant antibiotics as per culture sensitivity. The option of valve replacement was also discussed depending on the response seen with antibiotic treatment. He was advised to follow-up in 4-6 weeks post-discharge with a cardiology consultation. Furthermore  a callback to address lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation and substance abuse was planned.   The clinical course and treatment for this patient further underscore the importance of an early and accurate diagnosis of infective endocarditis  as it can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not identified and treated promptly.
14,9,70,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial70,Subject: Brief Case Presentation of a Patient Diagnosed with Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Demographics: Our patient  Mr. David Johnson  is a 45-year-old Caucasian male  a non-smoker  living in the suburban city of Pennsylvania  USA  and working as an engineer.  Chief Complaint: The patient's main complaints include a two-week history of intermittent fever accompanied by chills  fatigue  and unexplained weight loss.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a known history of rheumatic fever during his adolescence and has Type-II Diabetes mellitus  well-controlled with Metformin for the past seven years. No prior history of any cardiac disorders or surgeries.  Family History: His father died at the age of 70 due to myocardial infarction and his mother at 68 due to an Alzheimer's related disease. His younger brother has been recently diagnosed with hypertension and obesity.  Examination: On examination  heart auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation. He was found to display signs of peripheral emboli  including Janeway lesions and Osler's nodes. Neurological examination unveiled some motor weakness in the lower limbs  suggesting possible septic emboli to the brain as well.  Investigations: Blood cultures were found to be positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a thickened and deformed aortic valve with vegetations characteristic of infective endocarditis.  Management: As per the guidelines for the treatment of infective endocarditis  the patient was started on empirical antibiotics  which was later tailored to cloxacillin based on the blood culture & antibiotic sensitivity results. His blood sugar levels were closely monitored.   Follow-up: Pending after completion of antibiotic regimen. Regular follow-ups were suggested to monitor cardiac function and to reintroduce antihyperglycemic agents if deemed necessary.  This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion for endocarditis in patients with predisposing conditions  presenting with non-specific symptoms like fever  chills  fatigue  or vague cardiac murmur.
14,9,71,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial71,Patient Initial Presentation:  Patient: Mr. XYZ Gender: Male Age: 62 years Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired school teacher  Presenting Complaint: The patient has been experiencing intermittent fever  fatigue  night sweats  shortness of breath  and weight loss for the last month.  Past Medical History: Mr. XYZ was diagnosed with Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago  which is currently managed with metformin. He also had a history of Rheumatic fever during childhood with no prominent cardiovascular sequela noted in his adulthood. No known documented allergies were reported.  Family History: His father had Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus and died from myocardial infarction. His older sister has Hypothyroidism. Otherwise  the family history is unremarkable.   Social History: Mr. XYZ is a non-smoker and rarely drinks alcohol. He lives with his wife and enjoys gardening.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  Mr. XYZ was in mild distress secondary to discomfort. His blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg  heart rate was 100 beats/min  respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min  and he was afebrile. Cardiac examination showed a new systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. He also had splinter hemorrhages in his nails.  Laboratory Test and Imaging results: Laboratory tests revealed elevated white blood cell count  erythrocyte sedimentation rate  and C-reactive protein level  indicating an ongoing inflammation. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Echocardiogram showed vegetations on the mitral valve  confirming the diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis.  Management: The patient was started on empiric antibiotic therapy based on infecting organism sensitivities. Surgery was held off  considering the intervention's risks and the patient's preference in relation to his overall comorbidity status. Outpatient follow-up was scheduled to monitor his condition.  Discussion: Despite no history of IV drug use or previous valve problems  which are common risk factors  this case emphasizes the potential for Infective Endocarditis development even in patients with relatively low-risk profiles  such as Mr. XYZ.

He currently lives alone  has never been married and has no children. He retired from his job as a truck driver one year ago. He is a non-smoker but admits to a history of heavy alcohol consumption and occasional intranasal drug use. He has no known allergies but is not compliant with medications particularly those prescribed for his hypertension which was diagnosed two years ago. He does not exercise and has a diet rich in high-calorie food.  Previous Medical History: Mr. Murphy has a past medical history significant for uncontrolled hypertension  intravenous drug abuse  chronic kidney disease (stage 3)  and mild alcoholic liver disease.  Family History: There is a strong family history of heart disease. Both his parents passed away in their 70s due to myocardial infarctions.  Presenting Complaints: The patient presented with symptoms of fever up to 38.5°C  fatigue  night sweats  weight loss and a new murmur was detected on physical examination.   Investigations and Diagnoses: The initial laboratory tests revealed increased inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP)  raised creatinine  and mild anemia. Blood cultures confirmed the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. An echocardiogram revealed vegetations on his native aortic valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. His urine also tested positive for opiates.  Treatment and Prognosis: The patient was immediately started on appropriate intravenous antibiotics  in accordance with the results of his blood cultures. Cardiology and Infectious Disease specialists were consulted for the management of complications and to determine the need for possible surgical intervention. He will also need chronic management for his CKD  hypertension  and liver disease along with seeking assistance for his substance abuse.  Discussion: Endocarditis remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality  particularly in individuals with a history of heart disease or valve abnormalities. Risk factors in this case include the patient’s history of IV drug use and uncontrolled hypertension. As this case illustrates  early diagnosis through echocardiography and blood cultures  followed by aggressive antibiotic therapy is crucial for enabling a successful outcome in such cases. Alongside  lifestyle modifications and attention to chronic diseases will also play a key role.

He works as a construction worker and has been generally healthy until recently.  Medical History: The patient has a 20-year history of smoking  approximately half a pack per day  but quit ten years ago. He also has a 15-year history of hypertension  maintained via anti-hypertensive medications (Losartan/Hydrochlorothiazide 100/25 mg daily). He occasionally consumes alcohol  but no substance misuse has been reported. There is no known history of rheumatic heart disease or congenital heart problems  and he was not on any immune-suppressing medications prior to his diagnosis.   Recent Illness: Over the past few weeks  the patient has experienced notable weight loss  fatigue  and low-grade fevers. He also reported chills  nigh sweats and a loss of appetite.   Family History: The patient’s father passed away in his early 60s due to a myocardial infarction. His mother  currently in her late 70s  has a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He has one older sibling who is alive and well with no heart disease.  Physical Examination: Physical examination revealed a diastolic murmur in the aortic region  peripheral edema  and small  painless red-purple spots (Osler's nodes) under the skin of the fingers.   Diagnosis and Management: Blood culture tests returned positive  showing gram-positive cocci  leading to a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed large mobile vegetation on the aortic valve.  The patient was immediately put on intravenous antibiotics in accordance with Infective Endocarditis in Adults: Diagnosis  Antimicrobial Therapy  and Management of Complications by the American Heart Association.  Plan: The plan is to keep the patient on a four-week course of IV antibiotics  closely monitor his clinical progress  and consider surgical replacement of the aortic valve based on the response to treatment. Patient counselling in relation to lifestyle  medication adherence  and necessary follow-up appointments has been initiated.   Conclusion: This case highlights the possible cardiovascular complications in individuals particularly with habit history of smoking and existing hypertension. Regular follow-ups and health awareness can help in early detection and treatment of such conditions.

14,9,74,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial74,Case Presentation:  Patient Information:  Mr. Y is a 54-year-old male  who presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of persistent fever  fatigue  body aches and a new murmur noted by his primary care physician. He lived alone and worked as a machine operator.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) 10 years ago  for which he received rehabilitation. Prior to this hospital admission  he stated being clean for the past 8 years.  He also had a history of uncontrolled type-2 diabetes mellitus  which was diagnosed 20 years ago  but he had inconsistently taken his medication due to financial issues.  Complete Demographics:  Mr. Y is of African American origin and resides in a low socioeconomic urban area. He smokes approximately one pack of cigarettes per day and admits to occasional alcohol consumption.  Family History:  No known history of endocarditis in the family. His father died at 60+ years from a heart attack and his mother died at 50+ years from breast cancer. He has two siblings  a brother with type-2 diabetes and a sister with no known medical conditions.  Current Episode:  On examination in the ED  Mr. Y had a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius. His cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border and Janeway lesions were noted. Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus.  He was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis (IE)  possibly related to his history of IVDU and poorly controlled diabetes  both of which are risk factors for IE.  Plan:   The patient was started empirically on a combination of intravenously administered antibiotics (Vancomycin along with Ceftriaxone)  which were then modified according to culture and sensitivity results. Due to significant heart failure symptoms and large vegetation seen on transesophageal echocardiography  cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery were consulted for potential valve replacement surgery. His diabetes was also brought under control by the endocrinology team and he was provided with necessary psychosocial support and connected with social work to help improve his medication compliance and overall management of his health.  Discussion:   This case illustrates the importance of considering IE in patients with a history of IVDU and other risk factors  including poorly controlled diabetes and smoking. The new murmur  albeit a late sign  along with persistent fever and high inflammatory markers pointed towards a serious systemic infection.  Early recognition and prompt management can significantly impact the outcome in patients with IE. The management of IE involves appropriate antibiotics and sometimes surgery. Patients with native-valve IE require lengthy hospitalizations and close follow-ups to ensure a good long-term prognosis.
14,9,75,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial75,Patient Presentation:  Mr. A is a 63-year-old Caucasian male who has been living alone following his wife's recent demise. He is a retired steelworker and previously a heavy smoker (40 pack years) but quit 7 years ago.   Presenting complaint:  He attended the A&E Department with recurrent fever  fatigue  and night sweats that he had been experiencing for approximately six weeks. He also reported a recent loss of appetite and 6 kg unintentional weight loss.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he takes metformin  and hypertension controlled with lisinopril. He had a mild stroke approximately three years ago with no residual deficits. Furthermore  he has had no previous documented cardiac pathology.  Family History:  Father had a Myocardial Infarction at age 68 and Mother passed away from a cerebrovascular accident in her late seventies. His elder sibling has angina and younger sibling has type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Physical Exam:  On physical examination  he had a temperature of 38.6°C. His blood pressure was on the lower side  100/60 mmHg  and he had mildly elevated heart rate of 98 bpm. Oral examination revealed poor dentition. Cardiac auscultation demonstrated a new harsh grade III/VI systolic murmur heard best at the lower left sternal border.  Investigations:  Blood tests showed a raised white cell count and mildly impaired renal function. Two sets of blood cultures were taken  which grew Streptococcus viridans suggestive of bacterial endocarditis. An Echocardiogram revealed vegetation on the mitral valve  and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation was identified which was not present in the previous echocardiograms.   Diagnosis:  Based on the Duke criteria  he was diagnosed with definite infective endocarditis.  Management:  He was started on empirical antibiotics and referred to the cardiothoracic team for further management including valve replacement surgery.  This case highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment of infective endocarditis  particularly in a patient with risk factors such as poor oral hygiene and a history of chronic disease. The insidious onset of symptoms often leads to a delay in patients seeking medical attention  emphasizing the need for healthcare professionals to maintain a high index of suspicion when assessing patients with similar presentations.
14,9,76,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial76,Patient Presentation:   Mr. Johnson is a 56-year-old African American male presenting to the clinic with a one-month history of low-grade fevers  fatigue  malaise  and an unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds. He is a truck driver by occupation and lives with his wife and two adult children in a suburban neighborhood. He denies any travel history  recent infections  or exposures to sick individuals. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history and drinks alcohol socially. He does not use illicit drugs. His past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His medications include lisinopril and simvastatin. His surgeries include an appendectomy at age 20. Family history is notable for a brother with coronary artery disease at age 58 and a mother who passed away from breast cancer in her 70s.   Clinical Findings:  On clinical examination  he is febrile with a temperature of 100.8°F  pulse rate of 92 bpm  blood pressure of 136/78 mmHg  and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute. He appears fatigued. Cardiac examination reveals a new grade 3/6 diastolic murmur best heard over the left lower sternal border. Conjunctival pallor is noted. No Janeway lesions  Osler’s nodes  or Roth's spots were detected. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.   Laboratory Findings and Imaging:  Lab results show a normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 11 g/dL and an elevated ESR of 45 mm/hour. Blood cultures are positive for Streptococcus viridans. Transthoracic echocardiogram shows a 0.8 x 0.9 cm vegetation on the aortic valve with evidence of moderate aortic regurgitation. Chest radiograph is clear without any signs of heart failure or septic emboli.  Discussion:  Given the ongoing fevers  new-onset diastolic murmur  and positive blood cultures  the patient's clinical presentation and findings are best explained by a diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis. The source of infection is likely Streptococcus viridans  an organism frequently associated with this condition and commonly found in the oral cavity. The patient’s specific predisposing factors for endocarditis include his age and history of hypertension.   Treatment Plan:  Mr. Johnson should immediately start on IV antibiotics  which are guided by the bacterial isolates from the blood cultures. He will need to undergo a minimum of four to six weeks of IV antibiotic therapy  which may include ceftriaxone or penicillin G. The management may also require collaborations with cardiologists and potentially cardiac surgeons if antibiotic therapy is unsuccessful or complications arise.   Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of considering infective endocarditis in patients presenting with persistent  unexplained fevers  newly onset cardiac murmurs  and positive blood cultures  and the necessity of early diagnosis and treatment to avoid severe complications  like heart failure and stroke.
14,9,77,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial77,Patient Information: A 72-year-old Caucasian male  Medical History: The patient has a known history of Type 2 diabetes  mild hypertension  and has been an occassional smoker for the last 30 years. Regular medications include Metformin for diabetes  a low-dose Aspirin  and a Statin for mild hypercholesterolemia.   Family History: The patient has a family history of heart disease  with his father passing away at age 70 due to myocardial infarction. His mother is alive and manages Type 2 diabetes.  Presenting Problem: The patient was admitted to the hospital following two-week history of low-grade fever and malaise. On admission  the patient was lethargic and diaphoretic  with a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg  a pulse rate of 90 bpm  and a temperature of 100.7°F.  Clinical Examinations: Upon physical examination  a murmur was detected during a cardiovascular examination. The Murphy's sign was negative  but there were indications of splenomegaly. No signs of Roth’s spots or Osler’s nodes were noted during the eye exam and peripheral vascular examination.  Diagnostic Investigation: Blood tests revealed increased levels of inflammation  i.e.  raised CRP and ESR. Blood cultures  after being positive  identified Streptococcus mitis as the offending microorganism. An echocardiogram found a vegetation on the mitral valve  confirming native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment: The patient was treated with antibiotic therapy i.e.  a combination of penicillin and gentamicin appropriate to the sensitivity of the organism in the blood culture. Glycemic control was also meticulously managed given his diabetic status. The patient  upon an early diagnosis  responded well to the treatment.  Summary: The patient in this instance demonstrates that a well-controlled comorbidity like diabetes does not increase the risk for infective endocarditis. However  the history of smoking which could have led to periodontal disease  could be considered an infectious gateway facilitating bacteremia and subsequent endocarditis.  Conclusion: Currently  the patient is stable and continues on oral medication. He is also advised to cease smoking and maintain good oral hygiene to prevent recurrence. Additionally  close monitoring of his cardiac status is essential given his family history of heart disease  which could predispose him to further heart conditions.

14,9,80,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial80,Patient Presentation:  The patient  a 52-year-old African American male  presents with fever  malaise  and a new-onset heart murmur. He reports a progressively worsening condition in the preceding 2 weeks. Patient history indicates no previous surgeries. He was diagnosed five years ago with type II diabetes mellitus and manages his condition with diet and oral medications. The patient has dental caries and reports not visiting a dentist recently. He is married and lives in suburban Atlanta. His family history shows that his father died due to a myocardial infarction at an early age  and his mother continues to suffer from hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.5 Celsius. He appears acutely ill  with weight loss apparent. Cardiovascular examination reveals a new onset diastolic murmur best heard at the apex. Fundoscopic examination shows small hemorrhages with pale centers  consistent with Roth spots. There is no evidence of Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions.  Laboratory Results:  Laboratory results showed anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10g/dL and leukocytosis with a white cell count of 18 000 per microliter. Blood culture isolates continued to identify the presence of Streptococcus viridans  an important perpetrator of native valve infective endocarditis. Another notable finding was an elevated sedimentation rate suggestive of systemic inflammation.  Echocardiography:  Initial transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was obtained  and it revealed a thickened  mobile structure on the mitral valve suggestive of a vegetation. This was subsequently confirmed on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).  Diagnosis:  Combining the clinical  microbiological  and echocardiographic findings  a diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis was made.  Treatment Plan:  The patient was initiated on empiric antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone and gentamicin. Upon receiving blood culture and sensitivity results  which confirmed the susceptibility of S. viridans  antibiotics were narrowed to high-dose penicillin. The patient showed steady improvement over the next week  with resolution of fever and improved general strength. A TEE was repeated at the end of 4 weeks to evaluate the response to treatment.

In distress due to dyspnea. - Oral examination reveals poor dental hygiene with two apparent dental caries. - Cardiovascular examination reveals a new systolic murmur. - Lungs are clear to auscultation  though tachypnea is present. - Skin examination shows no rash  petechiae  or Osler nodes.  Investigations: Blood cultures were collected and echocardiography was performed  substantiating the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis; showing vegetations on the mitral valve. Routine investigations revealed anemia  slight leukocytosis  and elevated C reactive protein levels  suggestive of inflammation. Cultures grew Streptococcus sanguinis  a common pathogen implicated in infective endocarditis.   Summary: Mr. John Doe  a middle-aged male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and poor dental hygiene presented with recurrent fever  fatigue  dyspnea  and weight loss. His examination was suggestive of infective endocarditis  a diagnosis confirmed by echocardiography and blood culture findings. His lifestyle  occupation  low-risk behaviors  and the presence of Streptococcus sanguinis implicate poor dental hygiene and the subsequent oral infections as likely sources of bacteremia  leading to the development of infective endocarditis.
14,9,82,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial82,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male  referred to our clinic for evaluation of a four-week history of malaise  low-grade fevers  and weight loss. His medical history is notable for type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The patient is a current smoker (1 pack/day for 30 years) and drinks alcohol socially. Family history is significant - both parents had cardiac disease; his mother had rheumatic heart disease and his father had an MI at the age of 63.  Upon presentation  he appeared fatigued. Vital signs were stable  but the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.2°C. On physical examination  he displayed Janeway lesions on his palms and soles and Osler's nodes were observed on his fingertips. A cardiac examination evidenced a new previously undocumented murmur.  Laboratory values revealed a white blood cell count of 12 000/µL with 70% neutrophils  a hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL  and a platelet count of 150 000/µL. Liver and kidney function tests were normal. Three separate blood cultures taken over 24 hours evidenced consistent growth of Staphylococcus aureus  suggestive of a persistent bacteremia.  Echocardiography showed vegetations on the patient's mitral valve  compatible with the diagnosis of native valve infectious endocarditis. No significant valvular dysfunction was noticed.  The patient was immediately started on empiric antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis  with planned intravenous therapy for a total of 6 weeks. His blood glucose levels are being managed with insulin. The patient is recommended to quit smoking and moderate alcohol intake for overall cardiac health.  A multi-disciplinary team including Cardiology  Infectious Disease  Endocrinology  and Substance Abuse Counseling are involved in his care.  This case highlights the importance of considering native valve infective endocarditis in patients presenting with persistent fever and systemic symptoms  particularly in the context of predisposing factors like diabetes  smoking  and a family history of cardiac diseases. It also underlines the relevance of the physical examination in these cases  with classic Osler's nodes and Janeway lesions pointing towards the diagnosis.
14,9,83,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial83,Patient Presentation Mr. H is a 62-year-old Caucasian male with a history of intravenous drug use and tobacco smoking  who presents with consistent high fevers of 102°F  malaise  and unexplained weight loss over a span of four weeks. His past medical history includes diabetes  type II; hyperlipidaemia; and chronic hepatitis. He has no known allergies. Mr. H has been abstinent from drug use for the past two years  yet he consistently smokes a pack of cigarettes every day.  Demographics/Personal History The patient is currently unemployed and lives in supportive housing for individuals in recovery from substance misuse. He is originally from the Midwest but has been living in New York City for the past decade.  Family History Both parents are deceased. His father had a documented history of heart disease and died of myocardial infarction. His mother was diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension. He has one brother diagnosed with schizophrenia and another with substance addiction.   Presenting Symptoms and Examination On examination  Mr. H appeared acutely ill with noticeable pallor and was found to have Janeway lesions on his palms and soles. Listening to his heart revealed a mid-systolic click and late systolic murmur heard best at the apex  which were not previously documented.   Initial Investigations & Diagnosis Given his history  the ongoing fevers  cardiac signs and Janeway lesions  suspicion for infective endocarditis (IE) was high. Blood cultures were conducted  which grew Staphylococcus aureus. Initial transthoracic echocardiogram did not show any vegetations but given the strong suspicion for IE  a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed  demonstrating a mitral valve vegetation. The diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis was then confirmed.  Management Mr. H was started on empiric antibiotic therapies for S.aureus including intravenous cefazolin and rifampin  along with supportive measures for his fever. Given his condition and the identification of the causative pathogen  these initial antibiotics were chosen to best target the offending organism while minimizing collateral damage. A multi-disciplinary team involving Cardiology  Infectious Diseases and cardiothoracic surgery will manage his care.  Discussion Native valve infective endocarditis is a serious disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is most often caused by S. aureus in individuals who have underlying heart disease or who are intravenous drug users. Despite the high mortality rate  with early detection and aggressive treatment  patients have a good chance of recovery. This case underscores the importance of a thorough history and physical exam and the need for early diagnostic investigations when IE is suspected. Medical management involves prolonged intensive antibiotics therapy along with aggressive supportive care.
14,9,84,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial84,Case Presentation:   Patient Details: John Doe  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  resides in an urban neighborhood and is retired. His past medical history is significant with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient admits to be a former smoker for 20 years  ceased smoking 10 years ago. John maintains a moderate alcohol consumption but doesn't engage in intravenous drug use (IVDU). In his family history  his father had coronary artery disease and his mother was diagnosed with hypertension.   Presenting Complaints: The patient presented to the office with a 3-week history of low-grade fever  malaise  and a recent episode of confusion. He states his symptoms have worsened progressively over this time period. The patient's wife becomes concerned after noticing his sudden weight loss and night sweats.  Clinical Examination: On physical examination  the patient looked ill with peripheral cyanosis. Vital signs indicated a fever of 38.2 degrees Celsius  blood pressure of 140/75 mmHg  pulse rate of 110 beat/min  and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min. Cardiac examination revealed a grade 3/6 diastolic murmur best heard at the apex. There were no visible signs of petechiae  Osler's nodes  or Janeway lesions.  Diagnostic Investigations: The preliminary laboratory test results demonstrated a raised white cell count of 15 000 per cubic millimeter  elevated C-reactive protein level  and a sedimentation rate of 68 mm/hour. Further investigations including three sets of blood cultures and an echocardiogram were done. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus and the echo showed vegetation on the native mitral valve with moderate mitral regurgitation.  Diagnosis: Based on clinical and laboratory findings  the patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment Plan: John was admitted to the hospital and started on empiric treatment with intravenous antibiotics: vancomycin and cefepime. Following results from blood cultures  antibiotic treatment was deescalated to directed therapy with IV nafcillin for a course of 4-6 weeks. Consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon was made to discuss possible valve replacement given the severity of mitral regurgitation.  Outcomes/Prognosis: John's condition improved after a week of directed therapy. He remained for the course of treatment in the hospital with frequent echocardiograms to monitor the vegetation and the degree of regurgitation. The surgeon opined that valve replacement would be considered if there is no reduction in the vegetation size or if mitral regurgitation worsens. John was enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program and was educated about the importance of a balanced diet  regular check-ups  and good dental hygiene. He remains under close monitoring for complications related to endocarditis and will require lifelong prophylaxis for potential sources of bacteremia.
14,9,85,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial85,Patient Information:  Ms. Alice  a 55 years old African-American female  presents to the hospital with a 7-day history of fatigue  sweating  intermittent fevers  and several episodes of chills. She was previously healthy with no significant past medical or surgical history. She is a non-smoker and denies any illicit drug use. Family history is significant for rheumatic heart disease in her paternal grandfather.   Clinical Presentation:  The patient reported that over the past week  she has been experiencing episodes of fever  reaching up to 38.5 degrees Celsius. Accompanied by this fever are chills and periods of excessive sweating  particularly during the night. She has also stated that she feels weak and exhausted despite having adequate rest and sleep. She hasn't reported any chest pain  shortness of breath  sudden weight changes  or recent traveling.   Examinations and Diagnosis:  Physical examination revealed an afebrile woman with a mild tachycardia of around 100 beats per minute. A new diastolic murmur was noted on cardiac auscultation  and Osler nodes were observed on her hands and feet. No signs of septic arthritis or meningitis were present.   Blood investigations showed raised inflammatory markers with slightly elevated leukocytes count. Three sets of blood cultures were sent before starting antibiotics  two of which came back positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Chest X-ray and urinalysis were unremarkable. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia without any acute changes.   Given her symptoms  physical signs  and positive blood cultures  she was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.   Further  an echocardiogram was done  which confirmed the presence of vegetation on one of her atrioventricular valves. Her condition was classified as Subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE)  which occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream latch onto damaged heart valves  causing infection and inflammation.   Management:  Upon confirmation of the diagnosis  she was admitted to the hospital for further treatment. She was subsequently started on empiric dual-target antibiotic therapy using intravenous vancomycin for MRSA coverage and ceftriaxone for streptococcal coverage  pending blood culture sensitivities.   After 4 weeks of in-hospital treatment  the patient showed significant improvement  with all signs and symptoms resolving completely. The patient was subsequently discharged and referred to a cardiologist for follow-up and evaluation of the damaged heart valve.   Summary:  In conclusion  classic signs and symptoms of endocarditis  coupled with appropriate clinical investigations and diagnosis  led to an early and correct diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis in this previously healthy lady  which resulted in prompt initiation of appropriate treatment and a good clinical outcome.

Presenting Complaint: The patient presented to the ED with complaints of intermittent fever for the past 3 weeks  fatigue  night sweats  loss of appetite and a weight loss of 7 kg over the past month. He mentions experiencing breathing difficulties and mild chest discomfort during physical exertion. Patient admits neglecting his diabetic medication over the last 6 months and reports a sore throat that healed on its own about 4 weeks ago.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient looked pale and tired with slight difficulty in breathing. His temperature was 100.4°F  heart rate 102 beats/minute  respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute  and blood pressure 140/95 mmHg. He had splenomegaly  and cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur which was suggestive of aortic valve insufficiency.   Investigations: Lab findings show raised inflammatory markers (ESR=45mm/h  CRP=3 mg/dL)  mild anemia (Hb=10.2 g/dl). Peripheral blood smear showed features suggestive of hemolytic anemia. Echocardiography confirmed thickened Aortic cusps with vegetation  severe aortic regurgitation & left ventricular hypertrophy. Urinalysis was normal. Two out of three blood culture samples collected 12 hours apart  came positive for Streptococcus sanguinis.  Management: He was immediately started on intravenous antibiotics according to the current recommendations for infective endocarditis  with a regimen of Penicillin G with Gentamicin. An endocrinology consultation was sought to manage his uncontrolled diabetes.  The patient was counseled on the importance of medication compliance  good glycemic control and lifestyle changes. In addition  given the patient's family history  he was explained about the increased risk of cardiac complications and the importance of regular cardiovascular screening. Secondary prophylaxis for infective endocarditis recommended before any future dental and other procedures that could cause bacteremia.  A multi-disciplinary team approach involving a cardiologist  an endocrinologist  a dietitian  a rehabilitation therapist  and a social worker will be essential in the effective management of the patient's condition and long-term health maintenance.
14,9,87,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial87,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 50-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. He was admitted to the hospital after presenting with a one-week history of intermittent fever  weakness  loss of appetite  and weight loss.   Past Medical History and Family History:  He has a known history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) but has been sober for about five years now. Other significant histories include untreated dental caries and recurrent skin abscesses. No history of any cardiac disease or surgical interventions were reported. Family history is notable for cardiovascular disease  with his father dying of a heart attack at the age of 56 and his elder brother diagnosed with hypertension and ischemic heart disease.  Clinical Examination:  Upon physical examination  the patient appeared ill and fatigued. He had a heart rate of 110 bpm  BP of 100/60 mmHg  resp rate of 22 breaths/min  and a temperature of 38.5°C. Cardiac auscultation revealed a new systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Oral exam showed poor dentition with visible cavities.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  Blood cultures were drawn  which grew Staphylococcus aureus  indicating bacteremia. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a vegetation on the native tricuspid valve  confirming the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management:  With the diagnosis established  treatment included intravenous antibiotics as per the sensitivity report. His dental issues were addressed to prevent the future occurrence of infective endocarditis. The patient was educated about the signs and symptoms of endocarditis and advised to seek medical attention immediately if they recur.  Plan:  Given his diagnosis  the patient's hospital course will need to include close monitoring of his clinical status  response to antibiotics  hemodynamic stability  and any potential complications of endocarditis such as septic emboli  arrhythmias  or heart failure. Cardiology was consulted for further management and to determine the necessity of surgical intervention. Social work and substance abuse teams were also involved in planning his long-term care given his significant history of previous IVDA.   This brief case presentation has shown that early recognition of infective endocarditis  particularly in high-risk populations such as IVDA  is essential as this is a condition that can have severe  potentially fatal  complications if not promptly recognized and treated.

He is a lacto-ovo vegetarian with no history of alcohol or drug abuse.  Past Medical History: Mr. A has a reported past medical history of Rheumatic Fever as a child  hypertension  and Type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he has been on medication. He had a hip replacement operation 2 years ago  due to osteoarthritis and he has been experiencing recurring dental infections for the last 6 months which were intermittently managed with antibiotics.  Family History: Mr. A’s father died at 65 from a stroke  and his mother died at 78 from complications of diabetes. He has one brother who is alive and well  with no known illnesses. There is no family history of heart diseases or other genetic disorders.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. A was admitted with a three-week history of intermittent fevers  night sweats  loss of appetite  weight loss  and increasing fatigue. He also reported experiencing a general malaise and shortness of breath  especially on exertion. There was no chest pain  coughing or palpitations. A full cardiovascular examination revealed a new heart murmur.  Investigations and Diagnosis: The investigations included blood tests  cardiac monitoring  and echocardiography. Blood culture results indicated the presence of Streptococcus viridans. His EKG showed slight irregularities. The transthoracic echocardiogram highlighted vegetation on the mitral valve  confirming a diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis.  Management and Prognosis: The patient was started on a regimen of IV penicillin and gentamicin for aggressive antibacterial therapy. He was also managed for his symptoms and other co-morbidities. The patient responded positively to treatment at the six-week follow-up. He was advised on strict blood glucose level management and better oral health to prevent recurrence.  In conclusion  Mr. A's case was unusually complex due to his comorbidities and social demographics. The combined input of cardiology  infectious disease  and oral health teams was necessary to manage his condition effectively. This situation underscores the importance of considering a wide differential diagnosis in elderly patients with non-specific symptoms. It also highlights the integral role dental health plays in the bigger picture of overall wellness and prevention of severe conditions such as endocarditis. 
14,9,89,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial89,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male named John. He has a history of intravenous drug use and has been clean for the last 15 years. He is a retired mechanic  currently living with his wife  and has a family history of heart disease  with his father dying at the age of 68 due to a heart attack. His mother  aged 85  is alive and suffers from type 2 diabetes and hypertension.   Medical History: The patient has an existing medical condition of type 1 diabetes for over 25 years  for which he uses insulin. He also suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to a history of heavy smoking  and he quit smoking ten years ago. He has no known allergies. His last documented dental examination was about 2 years ago  unaware of any dental problems.  Presenting Issue: John presented to the ED with complaints of high fever  chills  night sweats  shortness of breath  persistent cough  and generalized body weakness for the past 3 weeks. He also reported unintentional weight loss of approximately 10lbs  fatigue  and occasional chest discomfort.  Examination: Physical examination revealed pallor  petechiae over the upper body and a temperature of 102 Fahrenheit. Cardiac examination showed a diastolic murmur. Respiratory examination revealed reduced breath sounds in lower zones. There was no peripheral oedema.  Lab and Diagnostic Test: Blood tests showed increased WBC count  elevated ESR and CRP. Three sets of blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. Chest X-ray showed no evidence of any lung infection. ECG was unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed large mobile vegetation attached to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. These findings were consistent with infective endocarditis.  Management & Follow-up: The patient was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin until the sensitivity report was available. Given the size of the vegetation and potential for embolization  the case was discussed with the cardiothoracic surgery team. The patient underwent successful mitral valve replacement and is currently recovering well. This case merits careful follow-up for assessment of treatment response  complication surveillance  and secondary prevention.  Teaching Points: This case emphasizes the importance of considering infective endocarditis in a patient with heart murmurs and persistent unexplained symptoms like fatigue  fever  and weight loss. Native valve IE  frequently seen with S. aureus infections  should also alert physicians of the possible underlying immunosuppressive conditions  such as Diabetes in our patient  as S. aureus is a common organism causing IE in these patients. Regular dental check-ups and good oral hygiene also play a vital role in preventing infective endocarditis.
14,9,90,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial90,Subject Case Presentation:  Patient Profile  The patient  Mr. L  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  a retired engineer  who resides in the mid-west region of the United States and has a history of chronic smoking (30 pack years)  regular alcohol consumption (20 units per week)  and type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 14 years ago). He was referred by his primary care physician for further investigation due to persistent fever and malaise for the last three weeks. He lives with his wife and has two adult children. There is no significant family history of cardiac disorders or other chronic illnesses.   Presenting Complaint   Mr. L. complained of intermittent fever  fatigue  loss of weight  and night sweats lasting for 3 weeks. He was diagnosed with a severe middle ear infection 1 month ago  but his symptoms persisted despite receiving antibiotics.  Clinical Findings   Physical examination revealed a diastolic murmur in the aortic region. Ophthalmic examination noticed Roth's spots and the patient reported experiencing double vision occasionally. Laboratory tests noted increased ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein)  suggesting an inflammatory process. Echocardiography revealed a mobile echogenic mass on the aortic valve suggestive of vegetation. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. Additional investigations also showed the presence of microabscesses in the spleen  suggesting septic emboli.  Diagnosis  Based on the patient's clinical presentation  laboratory findings  history of recent middle ear infection  and echocardiographic findings  he has been diagnosed with Native Valve Infective Endocarditis predominantly involving the aortic valve. The presence of Staphylococcus aureus in blood cultures suggests a secondary septicemia leading to infective endocarditis.  Treatment Plan   The patient is currently on empirical antibiotic therapy under hospital surveillance. The therapy includes an intravenous regimen of nafcillin and gentamicin  with the aim of targeting the isolated Staphylococcus aureus. Blood glucose levels are controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. Consultation with Cardiology and Infectious Disease specialists have been arranged. The patient's progress will be closely monitored  and cardiac intervention might be required if his condition persists or deteriorates.   Patient Education and Follow-Up   Mr. L has been encouraged to abstain from alcohol and smoking to improve his overall health status and reduce the risk of comorbid conditions. He will be closely monitored throughout his active treatment  and a long-term follow-up plan will be established to avoid any re-infection or potential complications related to infective endocarditis. 
14,9,91,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial91,Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. J  a retired engineer  who resides in Ohio. He has a 30-year history of controlled hypertension and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years ago. His father had a history of stroke in his late 70s  and his mother died of a heart attack in her 60s. Mr. J has been married for 40 years and has two adult children  both healthy. He is a non-smoker but admits to having 1-2 glasses of red wine every night before dinner since his retirement. He reports that he struggles with maintaining a regular exercise regime due to arthritic pain in his knees.  Presenting Problem: Mr. J was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of persistent fever  weakness  loss of appetite  and weight loss over two weeks. Physical examination revealed a systolic murmur and an echocardiogram showed vegetation on mitral valve consistent with infective endocarditis.   Investigations: Upon admission  blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans  the underlying bacteria typically associated with dental procedures. He recently visited a dentist for his biannual check-up where he had a tooth extraction for a dental abscess. However  he didn't take prophylactic antibiotics before the procedure due to his reported penicillin allergy. An EKG was performed to rule out any other cardiac pathology  which appeared within normal limits.   The patient's blood glucose level was elevated due to poor glycemic control. His HbA1c was 8.5%  and his LDL cholesterol was above the recommended limit. He was also found to be slightly anemic  with a hemoglobin of 11g/dL.  Diagnosis: Based on his clinical presentation  lab results  and echocardiogram findings  Mr. J was diagnosed with native valve infective endocarditis.  Current Status: Mr. J is currently stable and has been put on intravenous antibiotics. Consultation with a dietician has been done to address his elevated blood sugar levels and LDL cholesterol. We have also consulted cardiology for a potential treatment plan if the mitral valve damage continues to deteriorate.  Course of Treatment:  Considering all potential problems including diabetes  arthritis  hypertension  and recent heart condition  a comprehensive treatment plan will be implemented. Although the patient’s endocarditis is being targeted with broad-spectrum antibiotics for 4-6 weeks  a multidisciplinary plan regarding dietary changes  improved diabetic management  rehabilitation program (that takes into account the patient's knee arthritis) is in development.   Due to his penicillin allergy  sensitivities were conducted after culture of the bacteria in order to prescribe the most effective and safe antibiotic. Regular follow-ups with the cardiology team  in addition to the echos already completed  will be essential to monitor Mr. J's heart valve function.  Long-Term Prognosis: If Mr. J responds well to antibiotic treatment  has good control of his blood glucose level  maintains a balanced diet as guided by the dietician  and adheres to regular exercise within his ability  his quality of life can be maximized  and the risk of further cardiovascular complications can be minimized. This case underscores the importance of always considering infective endocarditis in patients with a history of any heart valve disease who present with persisting unexplained fever  particularly if they have undergone any dental procedures recently. It also highlights the necessity of antibiotic prophylaxis in at-risk patients undergoing invasive procedures. 
14,9,92,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial92,Patient Information: Mr. J  a 58-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. J presented with a 3-week history of fever  fatigue  weight loss and night sweats.  Medical History: Mr. J has a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis for which he has been on long-term steroid therapy. He also has a moderate to high consumption of alcohol. Recently  Mr. J underwent a dental procedure for which he did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis.  Family History: He has a strong family history of heart disease with his father having died of a heart attack at the age of 65. His mother is alive and well at 82.   Physical Examination: Upon examination  Mr. J appears unwell with a low-grade fever of 100.8°F. His heart sounds include a distinct murmur which was not documented in his previous medical records. He also displays evidences of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis including splinter hemorrhages under the nails and Janeway lesions on the palms and soles.   Investigations: Blood tests show elevated inflammatory markers  anemia and evidence of renal impairment. Blood cultures show growth of Streptococcus viridans. An echocardiogram reveals vegetations on the mitral valve suggestive of infective endocarditis.   Assessment: Based on his recent dental procedure  symptoms  physical examination and lab results  Mr. J is diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. Not receiving antibiotic prophylaxis before his dental procedure and his immunosuppressed state due to long-term steroid therapy for his rheumatoid arthritis are likely contributory risk-factor.  Plan: Mr. J will be initiated on appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy for at least 4-6 weeks as recommended by the local antibiotic guidelines and depending on the antibiotic sensitivity. He will regularly be followed up with blood tests  echocardiograms and closely monitored for any sign of treatment failure  complications or side effects. Alcohol cessation counselling and resources are also provided.   The above case presentation is a simplified example and real-life cases may involve a more detailed evaluation and more complex decision-making steps.

His temperature was 101.3°F  pulse was 95 beats per minute  blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg  and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed a systolic murmur. Skin inspection revealed petechial rashes on his lower limbs.  Investigations:  Blood investigations revealed markedly elevated white blood cell count. Blood cultures returned positive for Streptococcus viridans. Transthoracic echocardiography showed vegetation on the aortic valve with evidence of valve destruction and regurgitation.  Diagnosis:  On the basis of these findings  the patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment Plan:  Initially  AS was admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous Penicillin based on blood culture sensitivities. He was also given Gentamicin for its synergistic effect against S. viridans. Patient will need long-term antibiotic therapy. It was decided to monitor the valve function closely and intervene surgically if signs of heart failure developed or if there were complications related to endocarditis.  Patient Education and Follow-up:  Patient was counselled on the need for good oral hygiene considering his dental history. He was also advised and encouraged to quit smoking and reduce alcohol intake. A follow-up after one week of the initial treatment was scheduled to check for the therapeutic effectiveness and potential side effects of the medication.  In summary  this case highlights the importance of early recognition and management of infective endocarditis in a patient with history of rheumatic fever and several risk factors such as poor oral hygiene  smoking  and diabetes.
14,9,94,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial94,Patient Profile:  Mr. J is a 58-year-old Caucasian male who presented at the hospital with complaints of acute fever  malaise  and unintended weight loss in the past month. He hails from a semi-rural region and documents suggest sporadic  non-compliant encounters with healthcare providers in the past mostly due to financial constraint.  Current Presentation:  The patient arrived at the hospital  appearing septic and fatigued. Upon physical examination  fever (39.8 C) and a new murmur were discerned. Lab tests  including blood cultures  were immediately ordered and treatment initiated for presumed sepsis while awaiting definitive culture and sensitivity results.  Medical History:  Mr. J is a known smoker  with a 20-pack year history and an occasional alcohol drinker. He has a past medical history of rheumatic fever at age 19  and he was treated with Penicillin. Following that bout  he was diagnosed with mild aortic regurgitation. Mr. J does not take any daily medications.  Family History:  There is no family history of infective endocarditis  rheumatic fever  congenital heart diseases  or early-onset of atherosclerotic diseases. His father died of lung cancer at the age of 67 and his mother of a stroke at age 80. He has one brother who is in good health.  Clinical Findings:  Echocardiography indicated aortic vegetations  and blood cultures became positive for Streptococcus viridans. WBC count was significantly elevated and inflammatory markers (CRP  ESR) were significantly high.   Diagnosis:  Given his clinical presentation  significant findings on the physical exam  positive blood cultures  and confirmation of vegetations on echocardiography  Mr. J was diagnosed with native valve infective endocarditis.  Treatment:  Mr. J was started on empirical antibiotic treatment with Vancomycin and Gentamycin under sepsis protocol initially and then de-escalated to intravenous Penicillin G based on culture and sensitivity results  exhibiting sensitivity towards Streptococcus viridans  for a treatment duration of 4 weeks.  Discussion:  Infective endocarditis in a case of native valve disease triggered by Streptococcus viridans is a fatal condition that necessitates prompt diagnosis  aggressive blood culture-guided antimicrobial treatment  proper valve surgery when indicated  and steps to prevent further systemic complications. This case is critical as it underlines the importance of regular follow-ups in patients with a predisposition  such as rheumatic heart disease  for infective endocarditis  and the requirement of correct antibiotic therapy based on culture sensitivities.  This case also highlights the importance of understanding our population's social determinants of health. Lower socioeconomic status and barriers to accessing healthcare can contribute to these types of severe disease presentations. Recognizing these barriers and addressing them at a system level is crucial to prevent such occurrences.     
14,9,95,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial95,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  has been presented with a confirmed case of native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient is known to smoke about a pack of cigarettes a day with a 35-year smoking history. He is a known alcoholic but quit about 5 years ago. His father had cardiovascular disease and his mother died at the age of 78 from complications of diabetes. He has a brother diagnosed with hypertension. There is no other significant family history of illnesses. John works as a construction manager and has no known allergies.  Past Medical History:  John has a medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both of which are moderately controlled by prescribed medications. His diabetic condition was discovered about 10 years ago and he has been on Metformin since then. His hypertension was diagnosed 5 years ago and managed by Lisinopril. He is noted to be under continuous surveillance for these conditions.   Presentation of Illness:  John presented to the hospital with complaints of acute shortness of breath  high-grade intermittent fever  rapid weight loss  night sweats  and fatigue for the past 2 weeks. He also observed small red or purple spots on his skin  consistent with petechiae. Physical examination revealed a new cardiac murmur suggesting valvular vegetations. No noted neurological  abdominal  or pulmonary changes were present.   Diagnostics:  His CBC reported a high white cell count indicating the presence of an infection and an elevated ESR  both suggesting an inflammatory process. Blood cultures were taken which came back positive for Staphylococcus aureus. An Echocardiography confirmed the presence of mobile vegetations on the mitral valve  suggesting infective endocarditis. Other routine tests such as kidney and liver functions were normal  except for a slightly impaired glucose intolerance.  Discussion:  Considering the serious nature of his condition  the patient was started on empirical antibiotic therapy before blood culture results were available. Once the organism was identified  the treatment strategy was altered to target the specific pathogen. He was admitted to the hospital for close monitoring and continued intravenous antibiotic therapy as per Infective Endocarditis guidelines by American Heart Association.  Plan:  The plan is to complete 4–6 weeks of targeted antibiotic therapy and regularly monitor his symptoms  inflammatory markers  and cultures. Regular echocardiograms will be taken to monitor the condition of his heart valves. Due to his smoking habit and medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension  he is at risk for further cardiovascular complications. The patient has been advised to quit smoking with the help of a cessation program. Counseling on lifestyle modification  diet  and exercise were also advised to better control his diabetes and hypertension. The patient will be kept for regular follow-ups to monitor his condition. If the infection cannot be properly controlled with antibiotic therapy  the option of surgical intervention may have to be contemplated.
14,9,96,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial96,Patient Description The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis (NVIE). Past medical history reveals he had suffered a mild heart attack five years prior  and has been on a regular coronary artery disease medication schedule ever since. He also has a past history of high cholesterol that is well-controlled with medication.  Medical History The patient was diagnosed with type II diabetes about eight years ago and is insulin-dependent. There is no history of any kidney disease  liver disease  or chronic pulmonary disease. Past surgical history reveals he had undergone an appendectomy 30 years ago  and cholecystectomy 10 years ago. He neither smokes nor drinks alcohol  and maintains a balanced diet. Despite his past illnesses  the patient remains active with regular exercise.  Family History His father died from a heart attack at 65  while his mother died at 70 due to complications of Alzheimer's disease. Patient has one elder brother diagnosed with diabetes in his late fifties.   Current Presentation He presented to the hospital with complaints of excessive fatigue  night sweats  intermittent fever  and unexplained weight loss for the past month. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 101F  blood pressure at 130/90 mmHg and heart rate at 110 bpm. Cardiovascular examination showed early diastolic murmur at the left sternal edge. The patient was immediately admitted for further diagnostic workup.  Investigations Lab findings included leukocytosis  raised ESR  and positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus. Echo cardiogram revealed vegetations on the ventricular aspect of the aortic valve. This  coupled with his clinical and laboratory findings  confirmed the diagnosis of NVIE.  Summary The patient was started on an empiric antibiotic therapy (vancomycin and gentamicin) for NVIE  pending the results of blood culture susceptibility tests. His diabetes also needed better management to reduce further complications. Cardiology consultation was sought for potential surgical intervention  given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and the present condition. His course of treatment also includes aggressive cardiovascular risk factor modification  lifestyle alterations and stress reduction procedures. Regular follow-ups and ongoing cardiac monitoring were suggested for the patient.
14,9,97,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial97,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: Mr. James Brown is a 62-year-old African American male with a history of intravenous drug use. He is currently homeless and has been frequently living in shelters. He was brought to the ER after one of the homeless shelter workers noticed something was off - he was feverish  disoriented  and with complaints of severe fatigue  breathlessness  and chest discomfort.  Past Medical History: His medical history is significant for unrepaired Tetralogy of Fallot diagnosed in childhood which has untreated bicuspid aortic valve and moderate asthma. His dental condition is poor and he reports that his last dental visit was over two years ago. His last contact with health services was a year ago when he was treated for community-acquired pneumonia. For psychiatric history  he is a recovering heroin and alcohol addict  although still tends to relapse occasionally.  Family History: Patient's father died of a heart attack in his late sixties and mother has hypertension. He has two siblings - one has diabetes and the other with no significant history.  Examination and Investigations: On physical examination  he appeared ill  sweating profusely and with evident difficulty breathing. His body mass index (BMI) was 22. Cardiovascular examination revealed irregular heart sounds consistent with a heart murmur. His vital signs showed elevated heart rate and body temperature of 101°F. Lab work revealed elevated white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Blood cultures were sampled and sent for identification. A subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was helpful in further evaluation  demonstrating vegetations on the bicuspid aortic valve.  Diagnosis: After observing the patient’s symptoms  past medical history  and the initial assessment and diagnostic studies  the patient was diagnosed with native valve infective endocarditis  a common condition among intravenous drug users. This diagnosis was supported by his symptoms  physical examination outcomes  and both laboratory and imaging evidence of infection. His unrepaired congenital heart condition and the bicuspid aortic valve are risk factors for endocarditis.  Management and Follow-Up: The patient was admitted to the cardiology department and was started on broad-spectrum IV antibiotics  according to the potentially causative organisms and as per guidelines. A multi-disciplinary team approach  including infectious diseases  cardiology  and cardiac surgery was discussed given the severity of his condition and his social circumstances. The patient's dental health was also addressed and referred for urgent dental care. He was also enrolled in a drug rehabilitation program.    In conclusion  this case emphasizes the need for urgent attention to signs and symptoms suggestive of potentially serious conditions like infective endocarditis  particularly in high-risk groups. Collaboration between different specialties is also vital for optimal management.
14,9,98,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial98,Presenting Patient Information:  Patient Profile: A 52-year-old Caucasian male.  Presenting Complaint: Complaining of intermittent fever paired with rigours  chills  migraines and episodes of night sweats for the last 10 days.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of rheumatic fever during childhood but no significant illnesses past that point. He was occasionally consuming alcohol and was prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) two weeks ago for left shoulder pain secondary to osteoarthritis.  Family History: His mother died of a myocardial infarction in her 60s  and his father is alive in his 80s with hypertension.  Examination: On examination  the patient appeared acutely ill  with a temperature of 38.5°C  heart rate of 90/min  blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg  and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per min. On cardiac examination  a systolic murmur was noted at the apex radiating to the axilla.  Investigations: Lab tests showed a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein suggestive of inflammation. The full blood count demonstrated anemia and mild leukocytosis. Multiple sets of blood cultures grew Streptococcus oralis. Chest X-ray was normal while Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a vegetative lesion attached to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve.  Diagnosis: The patient met definitive infectious endocarditis (IE) criteria based on Modified Duke Criteria - positive blood cultures (for S. oralis – a known IE-causing organism) and echocardiographic evidence of vegetative lesion on mitral valve. Given his history of rheumatic fever  this is classified as Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVIE).  Treatment: He was started on Penicillin G and Gentamicin as per the specialist advice. The patient was counseled about his condition and importance of adherence to the therapy.  Discussion: This case represents a typical presentation of NVIE with a history of rheumatic fever  presenting symptoms  and confirmatory lab and imaging results. The patient didn't have any recent dental procedures but was on NSAIDS  which might have been a risk factor. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in managing this serious condition as delay can lead to grave complications including heart failure  systemic embolism  and death.
14,9,99,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial99,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Jones  who was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis. He works as an office clerk and lives in a suburban neighborhood with his wife.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Jones has a history significant for rheumatic fever at the age of 12  managed with antibiotic therapy. He also suffers from Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed ten years ago and is managed by hyperglycemic agents and lifestyle modifications. His lipid profile shows borderline hyperlipidemia. He is a reformed smoker. His BMI is 28  and he is working on weight management and fitness with diet and low-intensity exercises on the advice of his physician. He reports no known allergies to food or medications.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Jones presented with a 2-week history of low-grade fever  chills  malaise  and a significant reduction in weight. He also complained of a occasional chest discomfort  mostly noted at rest  but not radiating and without any known triggers.  Family History:  His father passed away at 67 due to myocardial infarction  and his mother is alive at 83  diagnosed with hypertension and osteoarthritis. His younger brother  55  has recently been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.  Laboratory Findings:  Blood cultures came back positive  revealing Streptococcus viridans. ESR  CRP  and WBC count were elevated. Echocardiographic findings were consistent with infective endocarditis  revealing vegetations on the mitral valve. In addition  HbA1c level was found to be 7.2%.  Management Plan:  Mr. Jones was admitted to the cardiology department and started on empiric IV antibiotics  with a plan to adjust as per the culture and sensitivity results. His diabetic medications were reviewed and adjusted  as maintaining good control of his blood sugar levels is essential for his overall management. After a heart team discussion  surgery is being considered if there's no response to medical treatment given the extent of valve's involvement and symptoms of heart failure.  Discussion:  In this patient  the infective endocarditis could likely be attributed to the sequela of past rheumatic heart disease which damaged heart valves and predispose them to infections. His suboptimal diabetes management may have also played a role in the risk towards this infection.  In terms of Mr. Jones' cardiovascular risk  the combination of familial predisposition  diabetes  obesity  and hyperlipidemia places him in a high-risk category. Though he has stopped smoking  his past history may have contributed to his overall cardiovascular burden. His management needs to be multidisciplinary  involving cardiology  infectious diseases  diabetology  and dietetics. His family should also be educated about the nature of the condition  compliance with treatment  and symptoms that warrant urgent medical care. 
14,9,100,diagnosis14-prompt9-trial100,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presented with a two-week history of fever  night sweats  and fatigue. He has no known allergies. His past medical history includes hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  which are well controlled with his current medication regimens of metformin  lisinopril  and atorvastatin  respectively. He does not smoke  drinks alcohol occasionally  and denies illicit drug use. His family history is significant for early onset cardiovascular disease  having a father who died at age 50 of a heart attack. In terms of the social history  he’s a retired engineer  married with two children.  Upon admission  a physical examination revealed a dental abscess and a new murmur over the mitral valve area. The patient reported recent poor dental hygiene due to fear of going to the dentist during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other findings include weight loss of approximately 5 pounds over the last month unintentionally. Laboratory test indicated increased serum inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP)  leucocytosis  and anemia. EKG showed no signs of ischemia or infarction.   Blood cultures were drawn and returned positive for Streptococcus viridans. Echocardiogram demonstrated thickening consistent with vegetation on his native mitral valve  with no significant valvular dysfunction noted. Based on these findings  the patient was diagnosed with native-valve infective endocarditis due to streptococcal infection.   Management and Treatment:  The patient was started on appropriate antibiotic therapy (penicillin G and gentamicin). The patient was carefully monitored for potential complications including heart failure  systemic embolism  and abscess formation. He was informed about the need for strict dental hygiene measures to avoid recurrence of infective endocarditis.  Recommendation:  It was recommended that the patient stay admitted to receive the complete course of IV antibiotic therapy and to procure supervision from a dental care provider for management of his dental abscess. It was advised that he resume his daily medications while recovering in the hospital.  Furthermore  he was referred to a cardiologist for a follow-up to monitor the progress of his treatment. Patient education was provided regarding signs and symptoms of complications of infective endocarditis that should prompt immediate medical attention.

His BMI is 31 and has a history of cigarette smoking (30 pack- year). He neither consumes alcohol nor uses illicit drugs.  Past medical history:  Mr. Smith has a known hypertensive since 10 years and has complained of dyslipidemia. He had a dental extraction performed one month ago.  Presenting Complaints: The patient reported a sudden onset of high-grade fever accompanied by chills  sudden weight loss  fatigue  night sweats and shortness of breath  especially on exertion. On further questioning  he mentions experiencing a loss of appetite and a new  changing heart murmur.  Upon examination  Osler's nodes in his fingers and toes and Janeway's lesions were noted. A cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border.  Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans  and immunological investigations show positive rheumatoid factor and elevated ESR and C - reactive protein.  With these clinical features and investigations  a tentative diagnosis of Native Valve Infective Endocarditis is made  more investigations are planned to confirm the diagnosis. The patient has been advised hospital admission for further work-up and management.
14,10,3,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial3,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. Derek Webb  male  65 years old  Caucasian  married  retired engineer. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He resides in the urban suburbs of Chicago  Illinois with his wife.  Past Medical History:  He has a medical history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension  managed with Metformin and Lisinopril respectively for the past 5 years. He is also regularly monitored by his primary care physician and takes his medications compliantly. He underwent a dental procedure 2 weeks ago. There is no known allergy history.  Key Complaints: Mr. Webb presented to his primary care physician complaining of an intermittent high-grade fever of 2 weeks duration  associated with chills  fatigue  and significant weight loss. He also mentioned experiencing night sweats and intermittent headaches  which he initially attributed to his age and changes in the weather. Also  he reported experiencing a new-onset palpitation  which was rare before and was reviewed as mild.   Physical inspection revealed paleness  mild edema on his feet  slight petechiae on his upper extremities  and a small painless erythematous lesion on his foot. His oral hygiene was noted to be poor with gingivitis present and a recent dental extraction site was noted. Auscultation of his heart detected a new murmur.   The persistent fever  new-onset palpitations  weight loss  fatigue  and evidence of heart murmur raised a suspicion of Infective Endocarditis.   Significance: This training case lends itself to a discussion on Native-Valve Endocarditis  focusing on predisposing conditions  such as poor oral hygiene and the recent dental procedure. It allows for the exploration of the signs  symptoms  and possible complications of native-valve infective endocarditis. Diagnostic tests that would confirm this diagnosis  such as blood cultures and echocardiograms  should be discussed. This case also brings to light the importance of robust history taking and the need for heightened clinical suspicion in a high-risk patient presenting with nonspecific symptoms that could easily be attributed to flu or other common conditions.

14,10,5,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial5,Patient Information:   Mrs. Jane Doe  a 62-year-old African American female  was admitted presenting fever  fatigue  weight loss and shortness of breath. She is a retiree living with her husband and has no children. She has been generally in good health but experienced a sudden decline over the past month.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Doe has a history of rheumatic fever in her childhood with a residual mitral regurgitation documented on a recent echo 2 years ago. She was on prophylactic Penicillin until late teens and has stopped it since then. She has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes managed with diet control and Metformin for the past 5 years. She was diagnosed recently with Stage 2 hypertension and is currently on Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide. Mrs. Doe has no history of recent dental work  IV drug use  or alcohol abuse. She has not traveled recently and has no history of any recent infectious diseases.  Key Complaints:  Mrs. Doe presented with a history of low-grade  intermittent fever for the past one month  accompanied by undue fatigue and a weight loss of about 12 lbs  which was unplanned. She also complained of experiencing breathlessness on minimal exertion  such as simply walking inside her home. On further questioning  she mentioned bouts of night sweats and a decreased appetite  but denied any chest pain  orthopnea  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  Physical examination revealed that Mrs. Doe appeared pale and had a slight tremor in her hands. She had a low-grade fever of 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit  a moderate systolic murmur heart best at the cardiac apex  and slight pitting edema in the lower limbs.   Assessment:   Native-valve infective endocarditis may be suspected based on her previous history of rheumatic fever and mitral regurgitation  and characteristic symptoms such as persistent fever  fatigue  and weight loss. The risk of acquiring this condition is also increased with her diabetic status.    Plan:   To confirm the diagnosis and to guide optimal treatment  we will obtain blood cultures  perform an echocardiogram  and commence empirical antibiotic therapy. Should IE be confirmed  therapy will be adjusted according to sensitivity results and continued for a prolonged period  alongside regular monitoring of the patient’s clinical progress and potential complications.

14,10,7,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial7,Patient Information:   The patient is a 45-year-old white male who hails from a small farming community. He is married and has two early teenage kids. He's a lifelong smoker and doesn’t consume alcohol. He had been working as a construction worker for the past 20 years. He's slightly overweight and doesn't participate in any regular physical exercise.  Past Medical History:   The patient was diagnosed with Rheumatic fever at the age of 15  and since then  has suffered from intermittent episodes of it throughout his life. He also experiences bouts of strep throat every winter. His mother has a history of cardiovascular disease  but the patient has not been diagnosed with any cardiovascular diseases himself.  Presenting Complaints:   The patient initially presents to the emergency room complaining of weakness  fatigue  low-grade fever that he has experienced for approximately 3 weeks. In addition  he has been experiencing night sweats and a decrease in appetite leading to significant weight loss. The patient also complains about a persistent and worsening headache  shortness of breath accompanied by mild chest pain and occasional dry cough.   On inquiry  he mentions a sore throat and a skin rash which he dismissed as trivialities a month ago. He also notes new-onset joint and muscular pain  and he’s noticed blood in his urine over the past week. He denies any traveling in recent times  significant dietary changes  use of drugs  or recent dental procedures.   The onset of symptoms is gradual  and symptoms have progressively worsened  leading him to hospital admission. On general physical examination  the patient is moderately built and nourished but looks unwell and fatigued. High and early diastolic murmurs are noted upon cardiac auscultation secondary to aortic regurgitation. Multiple Janeway lesions and Osler’s nodes are observed in the skin of his palms and soles.   These symptoms  combined with his history of rheumatic fever  classically point towards native-valve infective endocarditis. Hence  further investigations like blood cultures  EKG  and others should be ordered to confirm this differential diagnosis.

14,10,20,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial20,Patient Profile: Name: John Doe Age: 60 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Smoker: Yes Alcohol Consumption: Moderate  Medical History: John Doe has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in his twenties. He has had two episodes of pneumonia in the last four years. His medications include Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  aspirin for heart disease prevention  and statins for cholesterol management.  Key Complaints: For the past 2 weeks  John has been experiencing recurrent fever marked by intermittent chills and night sweats. He reports progressive fatigue  unexplained weight loss  and an occasional dry cough. Additionally  he has noticed blood in his urine. He experienced mild chest discomfort in the past few days  which has since progressed to moderate pain that is non-radiating and a mismatch with his usual angina.  Notes for Medical Students:  From the given patient history and symptoms  Native Valve Infective Endocarditis (NVE) is a key possible diagnosis. In the case of John Doe  it's essentially important to focus on his previous history of Rheumatic Heart Disease which put his valves at risk for bacterial infection. Given his complaints of weight loss  fever  fatigue  and hematuria  coupled with a history of heart disease and the new onset of chest discomfort  NVE should be considered. The history of smoking and moderate alcohol consumption are additional factors increasing the probability of such diseases.   You should further examine for signs of infectious endocarditis such as Janeway lesions  Osler's nodes  splinter hemorrhages  and consider treatments including various intravenous antibacterials  possible surgery for valve replacement and anticoagulants to prevent embolic events.

14,10,29,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial29,Patient Details: 56-year-old Caucasian male  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU); he has been sober for the past 6 months and is on a methadone program. He also has a record of seasonal flu every year.   Key Complaints: Patient presents with a two-week history of fatigue  moderate to severe joint pain  and a fever. He reports unintentional weight loss and night sweats over the past month. He also complains of experiencing shortness of breath on exertion for the past one week.  Case Description:  The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male with a history of IVDU  presenting with fatigue  joint pain  and fever for two weeks. His complaints are indicative of systemic illness or infection. Additionally  he reports unintentional weight loss and nights sweats over the past month  raising suspicion of chronic infection  malignancy  or other systemic disease. The appearance of shortness of breath on exerting himself for the past week is a new symptom for him. Given his past medical history of IVDU  the differential diagnosis should include native-valve infective endocarditis.  A physical examination reveals injection marks on his arms  signs of poor dentition  and splinter hemorrhages in his nails. Heart auscultation reveals a new murmur over the aortic valve area  indicative of possible valvular dysfunction. Eyes examination shows Roth spots and conjunctival hemorrhage  suggesting vasculitis associated with endocarditis. He also has a low-grade fever.   Blood tests  echocardiography and blood cultures for bacteria and fungi would be the next steps for final diagnosis.   Patient history  physical examination and symptoms suggest potential infective endocarditis. Thus  this case can serve as an introduction to diagnosing native-valve infective endocarditis  with emphasis on connection between IVDU and the disease  symptomatology  physical examination and related tests.

14,10,34,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial34,Case Study: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis  Patient Information Name: Mr. Williams Age: 62 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired engineer  Past Medical History Mr. Williams has been previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  for which he is taking Metformin  Lisinopril  and Simvastatin respectively. He has a history of mild dental caries but showed negative for bacterial endocarditis in last year's dental extraction event. Mr. Williams is also a former chain smoker but quit about five years ago.  Presenting Complaints Mr. Williams presented with a 4-week history of low-grade fever  night-sweats  a weight loss of around 14 pounds  and fatigue. He also mentioned that he had experienced a mild bout of a flu-like illness about six weeks ago. He reported repeated episodes of gum bleeding over the last month during toothbrushing  attributing it to his usual gum problems.  For the purpose of training: Upon evaluation of these presenting conditions  students are expected to consider a range of differential diagnoses. The combination of fever  weight loss  fatigue  and the chronicity of symptoms with an underlying history of gum issues should hint towards the possibility of infective endocarditis. Despite the patient not having an immediate history of heart valve disease  his age  and existing comorbidity (diabetes)  and his episodes of gum bleeding open up the possibility of native-valve endocarditis via hematogenous spread. Further investigation will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

14,10,37,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial37,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Harry Smith Age: 58 Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Plumber  Chief Complaints:  The patient presented at the clinic with a 2-week history of worsening malaise  intermittent fever  and unexplained weight loss. Mr. Smith also complained of occasional night sweats and shortness of breath on exertion.  Past Medical History:  No known history of illicit drug use. The patient has a documented case of rheumatic fever at the age of 12  but since then  has managed to lead a relatively healthy life. There is no significant familial history of heart diseases. The patient got his teeth cleaned at a dental clinic about a month ago.   Social History: The patient is a heavy smoker (30-pack years) but maintains a moderate alcohol intake.   Clinical Examination: On physical examination  the patient appeared tired and had a slight fever (100.4°F). He had a new murmur (III/VI systolic murmur) heard best at the cardiac apex on auscultation. In addition  scattered petechiae were observed on the patient's palms and soles.   Based on his symptoms and physical exam  Mr. Smith is suspected of having native-valve infective endocarditis. Further diagnostic workups including blood cultures  echocardiography  and eventually valve tissue culture (if required) may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis.
14,10,38,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial38,Case Study: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male named John  born and lives in Ohio. He is married with 3 children and 5 grandchildren. He is retired and used to work as a school teacher.   Past Medical History:  John has a history of type II diabetes mellitus under control with oral medications for the last 20 years. He was also diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and has been taking medication regularly. Mr. John has a known history of moderate to severe native-valve (mitral) regurgitation due to age-related degenerative changes diagnosed during a routine checkup 3 years ago but has so far managed to avoid surgery.   He has a 20 pack-year history of smoking but quit about 10 years ago and is a non-alcoholic. He is up-to-date on his routine vaccinations and has no known drug allergies.   Key Complaints: John reports the gradual onset of fatigue and having less appetite over the last three weeks. Additional symptoms include a low-grade fever and night sweats that he initially dismissed as possible flu. He also reported unintentional weight loss over this period. The most peculiar symptom he reported was a new onset of low back pain.  Considering that fever  fatigue  and night sweats are systemic signs of infection along with newly developed back pain  they raise a suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis with a possible seeding in the spine. This may be due to his pre-existing mitral requurgitation  which increases the risk of endocarditis. The presence of comorbidity such as diabetes might have contributed to his susceptibility to infection.   This case is important for medical students as it emphasizes the importance of recognizing nonspecific signs and symptoms in order to make an accurate and timely diagnosis of a condition like infective endocarditis  especially in a patient with known valvular heart disease. It communicates the understanding and detection of symptoms and manifestations related to metastatic infection  hence leading to comprehensive patient management.
14,10,39,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial39,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. Jones Age: 52 years Sex: Male Occupation: Construction Worker Ethnicity: African American Place of Residence: Urban setting in California  Past Medical History: 1. History of Intravenous Drug Use  ceased use approximately 10 years ago. 2. Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. 3. History of poor dental hygiene with multiple untreated dental caries  have not visited a dentist in 12 years.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Jones presents to the emergency department with complaints of: 1. High-grade fever persisting for the last 1 week  not associated with chills or rigors. 2. New onset of fatigue and malaise. 3. Increasing shortness of breath on exertion over the last five days. 4. Noticeable weight loss and decreased appetite in the past week. 5. A new heart murmur noticed by the regular internist at the last outpatient visit. 6. Night sweats and intermittent  non-specific  arthralgia.  Diagnosis: Infective endocarditis (native valve)  This clinical scenario showcases a middle-aged man who has significant risk factors for infective endocarditis. His history of drug-use confers the risk of bacteremia while his poor dental hygiene further suggests an alternative avenue of infection. The patient's diabetes could accelerate the progression of endocarditis. The signs of lethargy  malaise  weight loss  fever  and heart murmurs are typical of infective endocarditis. These symptoms combined from his past medical history hint towards the possibility of infective endocarditis complicating native cardiac valves.   This case will allow further discussions about pathophysiology  microbiology  diagnostic strategies  management  and prevention of infective endocarditis. Moreover  the impact of health behaviors  such as intravenous drug use and poor dental hygiene  is highlighted as potential risk factors.

The patient lives in the urban area of New York  and is a smoker with a pack/day habit for the past 35 years. He is a social drinker and denies any illicit drug use.  Past Medical History:  The patient’s past medical history is significant for rheumatic fever during childhood  but not much medical attention was sought for this. He also has a long history of poor oral hygiene resulting in multiple dental caries and tooth extractions. He has not had any major illnesses or hospitalizations. He denies any known allergies and does not take any routine daily medications. There's no family history of congenital heart diseases  although both his parents have hypertension and his father had a myocardial infarction at 65 years.  Chief Complaints: Over the past 2 weeks  the patient has been feeling generalized fatigue  low-grade fever  night sweats and unexplained weight loss of approximately 5 kg during the same period. Additionally  he noticed that he became easily short of breath especially when walking up stairs  a task that was easy for him earlier  and experienced occasional chest discomfort. He also complains of having a new-onset  low-grade  constant headache which appears to be worsening.    The training case will further explore symptoms  diagnostic procedures  laboratory findings  and management related to native-valve infective endocarditis while also considering the patient's personal and medical history. This clinical case can provide a thorough understanding of this condition in a real-life context  allowing medical students to apply their theoretical knowledge to practical situations. 
14,10,42,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial42,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. Smith  Age: 54  Sex: Male  Occupation: Construction Worker Race: Caucasian  Marital Status: Married  with 2 children  Insurance: Covered under employer's health insurance plan  Session: The routine health check-up turned to an in-depth case study.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith previously suffered from an acute episode of Rheumatic fever at the age of 13  which may have resulted in some prior damage to his heart valves. He is diabetic (Type II) and a chronic smoker. He stated these conditions were managed through diet  exercise  and oral medication. Mr. Smith is allergic to penicillin and follows a restrictive diet due to mild gastritis. There are no surgical histories  family history accounts for a familial hyperlipidaemia.  Key Complaints: 1. Mr. Smith's main complaints are constant fatigue and feeling unusually weak recently. 2. He experienced weight loss in the last month  which he found alarming.  3. For the past 2 weeks  he has been having low-grade fevers  mostly in the late afternoon and early evening. 4. He mentions having intermittent bouts of night sweats.  5. Smith notices a change in his heart rhythm – he has started to feel palpitations. 6. He also presents with a new heart murmur noticed incidentally in a regular diabetic check-up.  This presentation aims to highlight the case of native-valve infective endocarditis in a patient with significant history and comorbidities. It is crucial to understand the subtle indication of endocarditis through a thorough understanding of the patient's history and symptomatology. The attention should be given to the critical complaints like low-grade fevers  fatigue  weight loss  and new-onset heart murmur  which often overlooked but potentially indicate a serious condition like infective endocarditis.
14,10,43,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial43,Patient Information:  A 68-year-old Caucasian male presenting to the Emergency Department (ED).  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus  intravenous (IV) drug abuse (sober for five years now)  and prior episodes of Staphylococcus aureus skin infections. He has no known allergies and is currently only taking metformin for his diabetes. His family history is remarkable for heart disease.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient arrived in the ED complaining of a high-grade fever (~39.8°C) persisting for 2 weeks  fatigue  and loss of appetite. He also mentions he has experienced recurrent chills  night sweats  and weight loss in the past month. Additionally  he reports occasional chest discomfort and shortness of breath along with a new heart murmur noticed by his primary care physician.  In this case  the patient demographics (an older male with a history of IV drug use and recurrent staph skin infections)  coupled with his symptoms (fever  fatigue  appetite loss  chest discomfort  and new heart murmur)  strongly suggest the possibility of native-valve infective endocarditis. This case can be used to teach students about the risk factors  clinical presentation  and diagnostic approach to a patient with suspected infective endocarditis. The students should be instructed to assess the Duke criteria and possible use of echocardiography in the diagnosis and management of native valve endocarditis.
14,10,44,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial44,"Patient Information:   A 55-year-old Caucasian male  Past Medical History:   The patient has a history of intravenous drug use  currently in recovery for about 5 years. He has been diagnosed with diabetes 3 years ago and is currently under metformin treatment. No known allergies. He has no previous hospitalizations and has not had any surgical interventions. He has a 10-pack year smoking history but quit 4 years ago. Receives regular check-ups  last being six months ago. Family history reveals cardiac disease in his father  who passed away from myocardial infarction in his early 60s.   Chief Complaints:   The patient came to the emergency department with chief complaints of high-grade fever that's been persistent in the past 2 weeks  fatigue  shortness of breath  and unintentional weight loss. He also reports swelling in both ankles. He notes a new heart murmur which he describes as a constant """"whooshing"""" sound in his ears which he's never experienced before. He also noticed rashes on his abdomen and chest and some red painful spots on the pads of his fingers and toes. He denies any headache  chest pain  or fainting spells. There has been no recent dental work.   This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough history taking and physical examination  including knowledge about risk factors (history of IV drug use  diabetes) in approaching the diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. It also incorporates some of the classical symptoms (fever  new heart murmur  peripheral signs such as findings on the skin and nails) associated with this condition."
14,10,45,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial45,Patient Information: 67-year-old Caucasian male  Presenting Complaint: Intermittent fever  chills  fatigue  malaise  loss of appetite  weight loss  and a new heart murmur noticed over the past few weeks.  Past Medical History:  1. History of intravenous (IV) drug use which he quit four years ago 2. Hypertension managed on losartan for the last 10 years 3. Smoker and occasional alcohol consumer  Social History: Retired engineer  lives alone. Has two grown-up children living out of state.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient appeared pale and fatigued. The oral cavity showed some dental caries. Cardiovascular exam revealed a new murmur  best heard across the mitral area with an irregular rhythm. No Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions were noted on the skin.  Key Complaints to Discus: The key complaints and findings to be discussed here include fever  fatigue  weight loss  new-onset heart murmur suggestive of a valvular abnormality  and medical history of IV drug use which predisposes him to infective endocarditis (IE). His poor dental hygiene status is a potential source of bacterial entry.   Teaching points should include an overview of native valve endocarditis  pathophysiology  the importance of oral health in cardiac disease  clinical features  and the link between IV drug usage and infective endocarditis. Importantly  students should be encouraged to appreciate the fact that while the patient had given up IV drug usage  the effects on his cardiovascular system continue to manifest and lead to disease presentations such as this. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and high-risk factors for IE is of pivotal importance in secondary prevention strategies.
14,10,46,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial46,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: A 75-year-old African-American female is under review.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  peripheral vascular disease  and stage 3 chronic kidney disease. She had no known allergies. The patient had a 10 years history of IV drug use  but has been clean for the past 25 years.  Chief Complaints: The patient presents to the emergency department complaining of fever  fatigue  weight loss over the past month and increasing dyspnea on exertion for the past week. She also mentions experiencing an intermittent headache and night sweats. She denies any chest pain  cough  sputum production  or gastrointestinal symptoms.   Brief Review: Upon physical examination  the patient is noted to be febrile with a temperature of 38.5 C  tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg and has an elevated respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular examination reveals a diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal edge  dental examination shows poor oral hygiene with multiple dental caries. There is no peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis. A chest X-ray does not show any evidence of heart failure. These symptoms and signs indicate possible native-valve infective endocarditis.    Diagnosis and further investigations such as blood cultures  echo-cardiograms  and possibly valve tissue histology  are suggested to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy. Endocarditis due to Streptococci  Staphylococci  or Enterococci (the HACEK group of bacteria) should be suspected in this case.   The utility of this case for medical education lies in its focus on native-valve infective endocarditis – an important differential to consider in a patient with a history of IV drug use  even if long ago  presenting with sepsis and new heart murmurs. It also emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive examination and interpreting physical signs in the context of the patient's history and presenting complaints; bringing together pieces of clinical information to formulate a logical differential diagnosis and subsequent investigative and management plan.

Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith has a past medical history significant for Hepatitis C and hypertension  both of which are currently under control. He has been clean from substances for the past 10 years and has no known heart diseases.   Presenting Complaints:   Mr. Smith has been presenting to the clinic with four weeks of vague symptoms that have progressively worsened. He reports experiencing a low-grade fever  fatigue  worsening dyspnea on exertion  and weight loss. He also mentions experiencing a persistent  dry cough and night sweats. Mr. Smith has newly developed heart murmur.   For the past three days  Mr. Smith has developed a painful  erythematous rash on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet that are not itchy. He is concerned as he has also recently noticed red spots present on the white part of his eyes.   Given Mr. Smith's past medical history  clinical features  and recent complaints  it would be essential to consider native-valve infective endocarditis in the differential diagnosis.   This case will help to train medical students to recognize complex clinical pictures  take comprehensive histories  and should lead to discussion on the approach towards diagnosis. Further steps to confirm diagnosis might include blood cultures  echocardiography  and meeting modified Duke criteria for infective endocarditis. Additionally  the course for this patient could include treatment options such as antibiotics and possible surgical intervention.

Recently he has noticed that his ankles have become swollen.   He has also been experiencing a shortness of breath  especially after basic daily activities such as walking a short distance. Additionally  he has been suffering from recurrent dizziness along with occasional chest discomfort and palpitations. He has not been feeling hungry lately and has been having trouble sleeping. Mr. Davis mentioned that he has not seen any open wounds or skin infection recently.   This concise training case focuses on the potential diagnosis and treatment of native-valve infective endocarditis  given the patient's history and key symptoms.
14,10,50,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial50,Patient Information:  A 60-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Johnson  with a body mass index of 27  former smoker  and residing in the urban area.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a history of stage II hypertension under control with amlodipine and type II diabetes mellitus managed with oral hypoglycemic metformin. He was previously diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in his younger years and currently on prophylactic penicillin.  Chief Complaints: Patient presents to the emergency department with complaints of high grade  intermittent fever for 1 week associated with chills and fatigue. He also reports experiencing drenching night sweats and a weight loss of approximately 15 lbs in the last month. In addition  he mentions gradually worsening shortness of breath during normal activities and an episode of blood in his urine. He also noticed a red painful spot on the underside of his left foot  which he believes appeared three days ago. His family noticed changes in the patient’s behavior including occasional confusion  which is unusual for him.  This case report could be utilized to provide medical students the opportunity to think critically about the symptoms and signs of native-valve infective endocarditis  given the patient’s history  demographics  and chief complaints. The symptoms including fever  chills  fatigue  shortness of breath  weight loss  hematuria  neurological symptoms  and Janeway’s lesions (painless  flat  erythematous spots on palms and soles) are suggestive of the condition. The patient's history of rheumatic heart disease and prophylactic penicillin usage is a crucial clue  indicating underlying valvular defects - a risk factor for infective endocarditis. The task would be to derive a differential diagnosis  pinpoint pertinent tests to confirm the diagnosis  and recommend appropriate management in light of the patient's overall health status. 
14,10,51,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial51,Patient Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Sex: Male Age: 65 years old Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Dentist Residence: Urban Marital Status: Married  Past Medical History:  1. No known allergies. 2. Medical history significant for valvular heart disease (mitral valve prolapse). 3. Regular medications include aspirin  metoprolol  and multivitamins. 4. Smoking history of 10 pack years  quit 15 years ago. 5. Occasional alcohol consumption  denies illicit drug use.  Key Complaints:  The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of intermittent high-grade fever with chills and night sweats for the past two weeks. He also reported generalised malaise  unintentional weight loss  and a new-onset shortness of breath on exertion  which has gradually worsened. The patient denies any chest pain  cough  orthopnea  syncope  or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Interestingly  the patient recalled a dental extraction procedure performed approximate a month ago  followed by which he developed a mild fever that resolved spontaneously. Prior to this episode  the patient had not been noticing any similar symptoms.   The case should be designed to guide students through a detailed evaluation process  leading towards the right diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis  especially in a patient with previous valvular heart disease and recent dental procedures. This will also open up opportunities to discuss the importance of prophylactic antibiotics in such scenarios. Essentials would include history taking  physical examination (looking for signs like Osler’s nodes  Janeway lesions  Roth’s spots  or a new murmur)  laboratory and imaging studies (blood culture  echo) and their interpretations. It would also ideally include the management and potential complications of the condition.
14,10,52,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial52,Case Report:  Patient Information: Jacob Thompson  a 54-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the Emergency Department.  Chief Complains: The patient reported consistent fever and lethargy for the past two weeks. He also complained of having a new heart murmur.  Past Medical History: Mr. Thompson has a history of intravenous drug usage for two years and has been clean for five years now. His medical history also includes managed type II diabetes  previous bouts of recurrent cellulitis  and recent dental work done a month ago.  Physical Exam Findings: Temperature: 38.3°C Heart rate: 106 beats/min  Respiratory rate: 20 breaths/min  Blood pressure: 140/90 mmHg  Oxygen saturation: 97% on room air  There are Osler's nodes on his fingers and toes  and Janeway's lesions visible on his palms and soles. Cardiac examination reveals a new-onset regurgitant murmur at the left lower sternal border. Routine chest auscultation reveals coarse breathing sounds.  Labs:  Hemoglobin: 11.0 g/dL  WBC count: 15 000/µL  ESR/CRP: Elevation noted  Blood cultures: Pending  Diagnosis: The clinical presentation aligns with a diagnosis of native valve infective endocarditis. The chronic history of intravenous drug use  recent dental work and identifying signs such as Osler's nodes  Janeway's lesions  and new onset murmur suggest this possibility. Additional diagnostic criteria for endocarditis (Duke criteria) may be further used to establish the diagnosis definitively. Further confirmatory culture tests and an echocardiogram should be ordered immediately.   This case should prompt discussions on the clinical signs and symptoms of infective endocarditis  consequences of chronic intravenous drug usage and importance of prophylaxis before dental procedures in high-risk patients. It should also highlight the need for identifying valve involvement and potential risks associated with the condition. Considering the patient's history of diabetes  it is also important to discuss the ways in which bacterial endocarditis could present differently in this patient group.
14,10,53,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial53,Patient Case Description:  Patient Demographics: Name: Patient X Age: 65 years old Sex: Male Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Civil Engineer Living situation: Lives alone  Past Medical History: 1. Treated for Rheumatic fever at age 15. 2. Hypertensive for past 20 years under medication. 3. History of IV drug use in early adulthood; abstinent now. 4. History of smoking  now quit about 5 years ago.  Presenting Complaints: Patient X has been experiencing persistent  low-grade fever for the past couple of weeks. Accompanied with this fever  he is also reporting having a loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss. He mentions feeling extremely fatigued  but initially attributed the symptoms to aging and work stress.   However  over the past few days  he has also noticed small  reddish or purplish spots (petechiae) on his skin and inner side of his mouth. He turned most worried when he started experiencing intermittent heart palpitations.  He presents to the emergency department after fainting in his home due to these recurrent palpitations and shortness of breath. Relations to physical activity are unclear. No known allergies reported.
14,10,54,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial54,Case Report  Patient Background Information:  Age: 57 years Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Construction worker Living Situation: Lives alone in a suburban setting.  Past Medical History:   - History of intravenous drug use in his early 20s.  - He quit drugs at 25 and remained sober since then. - Diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 40.  Presenting Complaints:  - Fever lasting for more than two weeks. - Weight loss noticed at the same time as the fever onset. - Fatigue and general malaise. - Night sweats. - Experiencing shortness of breath  particularly when lying down or walking a short distance. - Palpitations occasionally experienced.   Summary:  A 57-year-old Caucasian male  with a past history of intravenous drug use and hypertension  presented with chief complaints of fever persistent for over two weeks  weight loss  fatigue  and night sweats. Furthermore  he reported experiencing shortness of breath  notably when lying flat or walking short distances  which was not normal for him. On occasion  the patient also experienced palpitation which was described as a feeling of a rapidly beating heart. He sought medical attention as the symptoms started to interfere with his daily life and work obligations.  Consideration:  In this case  students need to connect the symptoms and past history of the patient to suspect infective endocarditis. The patient's history of previous intravenous drug use is crucial  which puts him at risk for this condition. Furthermore  the presence of persistent fever  weight loss  and complaints of breathlessness may suggest possible involvement of a valve pathology. This case will educate the students about the importance of understanding the patient's past medical history  symptoms  and considering all these aspects in making a potential diagnosis. During this exercise  students will learn to identify the risks  signs  symptoms  diagnostic tests  and possible treatment modalities for infective endocarditis.
14,10,55,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial55,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. Jackson  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired construction worker  presented to the hospital.  Chief Complaints: Mr. Jackson complained of continuous high-grade fever for two weeks  intermittent chills  sweating  loss of appetite  weight loss  and general weakness. He also mentioned experiencing breathlessness on mild exertion  which was new to him.  Past Medical History: The patient has a 10-year history of uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  and Hypertension for which he takes Metformin and Lisinopril respectively. He was diagnosed with a mild Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) 5 years ago with no significant regurgitation and has regular follow-ups with a cardiologist. He has no known drug allergies. He is a non-smoker and denies any illicit drug usage. Mr. Jackson has no prior hospitalizations and lives with his wife. He adheres to his medication regimen as prescribed and has no significant family history of cardiac problems.  Based on the patient's complaints  demographics  past medical history  and risk factors  students should be encouraged to consider native-valve infective endocarditis due to the MVP in their differential diagnosis. The high-grade fever suggests a possible infection  while the breathlessness on mild exertion implies potential heart failure secondary to the infective endocarditis. The students should be taught to investigate the patient's symptoms through a targeted history  physical examination  and necessary diagnostics to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapy.  This case will also provide an opportunity to discuss the etiology  pathophysiology  clinical presentation  complications  and management of native-valve infective endocarditis  highlighting the significance of early diagnosis and intervention in such cases. Suggestive treatment approaches should involve antibiotics per latest guidance  considering the patient's age  comorbidities  allergy status  lab results  and culture sensitivities. The team should be reminded to take into account the patient's comfort  preferences  lifestyle  and overall well-being while formulating the treatment plan.

In the past month  he had undergone dental treatment for root canal therapy and had 2 episodes of allergic reactions which resolved spontaneously. He admits to not regular with his follow-up for diabetes management due to personal reasons.  Summary: This training case focuses on a 55-year-old male patient with a history of uncontrolled diabetes  intravenous drug use  and recent dental procedure  presenting with symptoms like high-grade fever and fatigue  which are suggestive of native valve infective endocarditis. The patient's history of intravenous drug use  possible bacteremia following the dental procedure  his diabetes and non-healing skin lesions are potential risk factors and provide a platform for medical students to delve into the relationship between these factors and the development  diagnosis  and management of infective endocarditis.
14,10,58,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial58,Patient Details: Name: Patient X Age: 65 years Gender: Male Occupation: Retired teacher Race: Caucasian  Past medical history: Patient X has a history of IV drug use in the past  he is suffering from chronic treatment-resistant hepatitis C  and has been through multiple rounds of unsuccessful antiviral therapy. He has been sober for the last 20 years but continues to have annual check-ups for hepatitis C. The patient also has a history of rheumatic fever in his childhood which led to moderate aortic valve disease. He also had atrial fibrillation for which he has been on warfarin therapy for several years. He was a heavy smoker but quit a decade ago.  Key Complaints: Patient X was admitted with a two-week history of lethargy  malaise  and intermittent fever. He also complained of newly onset shortness of breath  especially on exertion. He indicated he had lost weight unintentionally over the past few weeks. Furthermore  he mentioned experiencing night sweats and a decrease in appetite. He reported an episode of seeing blood in his sputum a few days ago.   Travel/ Exposures: The patient has not travelled recently and lives alone. He mentioned a dental procedure performed about a month ago where antibiotics were not prophylactically given.   Lifestyle: Patient X used to be a heavy smoker but gave up a decade ago. He has a history of intravenous drug use  but he became sober 20 years ago.  Reason for the Report: This patient's complaints of fever  fatigue  an episode of hemoptysis  and noticeable weight loss combined with a significant past medical history of IV drug abuse and aortic valve disease could indicate a possible diagnosis of native-valve infective endocarditis. The absence of prophylactic antibiotics during a dental procedure adds to the risk. Hence  medical students should consider these symptoms to recognize and initiate the management of potential infective endocarditis.
14,10,59,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial59,Case Report  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian male.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of intravenous drug use and was treated for hepatitis C three years ago. He also has a history of smoking (1 pack/day for 30 years) and moderate alcohol consumption. He has no documented history of heart disease  hypertension or diabetes.  Chief Complaints: The patient presents to the emergency department with new onset fever  general malaise  fatigue  and shortness of breath on exertion for the last 2 weeks. He also reports having night sweats  intermittent chills and a weight loss of approximately 8 pounds over the same period. The patient admits to a few episodes of passing dark colored urine in the past week. He denies having chest pain  cough  abdominal pain  or nausea and vomiting.
14,10,60,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial60,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 58 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Plumber Social habits: Smoker (1 pack/day for 30 years) Location: Urban  Case Report:  Mr. John Doe  a 58-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the outpatient department with a two-week history of fever  night sweats  chills  and unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds. He also mentions experiencing fatigue  shortness of breath  and a persistent cough  which he initially assumed to be related to his smoking habit and season change. He denies any history of illicit drug use but admits he smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and has done so for the last 30 years.  Past medical history is significant for rheumatic fever in childhood  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes which he manages with oral medications. He has no known allergies.  On examination  he appears cachectic  and his temperature is elevated at 38.6°C (101.48°F). Cardiovascular examination reveals a new systolic murmur heard best at the apex that radiates to the axilla. His lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. He has non-tender splenomegaly. His skin shows petechiae on his lower extremities and his conjunctiva are pale.  The overall clinical presentation and past rheumatic fever history suggest a native-valve infective endocarditis case  requiring further evaluation and management.  Key clinical features for the case: Onset of nonspecific symptoms including persistent unexplained fever and weight loss which may indicate a systemic infection. New onset murmur may suggest valvular damage due to infection. A history of rheumatic fever which put him at risk of endocarditis. Physical findings such as petechiae and splenomegaly which are consistent with endocarditis.  Skin and systemic physical findings suggest the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Habits which exacerbate his overall health and predispose him to risks of infections such as smoking.

14,10,62,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial62,Patient Information: A Caucasian woman  aged 65 years  presents to the emergency department at a local hospital.   Past Medical History: Patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis  for which she was prescribed methotrexate. She is also a regular smoker with a 30-pack year smoking history.  Presenting Complaints: For the past week  she complained of persistent high-grade fever  chills  fatigue  and night sweats. Other symptoms include loss of appetite leading to significant weight loss and a new heart murmur. She also mentioned an unusual shortness of breath  especially when performing strenuous activities. On specific inquiry  she disclosed experiencing arthralgia predominantly affecting her knee and shoulder joints. She did not report any recent dental procedures or surgeries and she denied any drug abuse.  Physical Examination Findings: Upon physical examination  she appears exhausted and diaphoretic. Vital signs revealed: temperature - 38.6 degrees Celsius  pulse rate - 101 per minute  respiratory rate - 22 per minute  blood pressure - 105/65 mmHg  oxygen saturation - 96% on room air. Her heart examination showed a new regurgitant murmur best heard at the mitral area. Skin examination revealed petechiae in the conjunctiva and splinter hemorrhages in the nail beds. No Osler nodes or Janeway lesions were noted.   Potential Clinical Concern: The clinical presentation of consistent fever  fatigue  weight loss  new onset cardiac murmur and evidence of vasculitic lesions in the patient raises the suspicion of native-valve infective endocarditis. Additional investigations like blood cultures and echocardiogram are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Appropriate treatment should be initiated promptly to reduce the risk of potential complications  such as heart failures and systemic embolizations.  Additional Recommendations: This case can be used to teach medical students about the importance of detailed history taking  holistic examination and high clinical suspicion in diagnosing non-specific presentations like infective endocarditis. It also emphasizes the alterations in presentation due to underlying co-morbid conditions and the knowledge about potential triggers like use of immunosuppressants for rheumatoid arthritis.

14,10,68,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial68,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 62-year-old African-American male.  Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history includes hypertension  Type II diabetes mellitus  and tobacco use - 2 packs per day for the last 40 years. He has not ever been diagnosed with heart disease or rheumatic fever and denies past illicit IV drug use. Three months ago he suffered from a dental abscess which was treated by his dentist without complications.  Current Complaints: The patient presents to the ER with complaints of fever and fatigue for three weeks  intermittent night sweats  new onset of shortness of breath for five days  and a two day history of swollen feet. He acknowledges weight loss of ten pounds over the last month due to decreased appetite but denies chest pain or cough. He notes that he has been feeling generally unwell but thought it was the flu until he developed difficulty in breathing.   On physical examination  he is found to be very pale  febrile (38.7 C)  tachycardic (118 bpm)  and displays mild peripheral edema. Upon auscultation of the heart  a new murmur is detected - a grade III/VI mid-systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border.  This clinical case focuses on pneumonia and heart disease  with a particular emphasis on native-valve infective endocarditis  its risk factors  diagnostic investigation  and management. The presence of a new heart murmur  the patient's recent history of dental abscess along with non resolving fever despite it's non-specific presentation should raise suspicion of infective endocarditis in this patient. Investigation plans should include blood cultures  echocardiography  and possible other sources of infection like dental examination. This case will provide a good learning opportunity on multi-system influence considering cardiovascular  infectious disease and potential hematologic issues related to subacute bacterial endocarditis.
14,10,69,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial69,Patient Information:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 57 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Carpenter  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe is an otherwise healthy man with no significant past medical history. He has a 20-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol socially. There's no record of homelessness  drug addiction  or significant travel history.  He has not been previously hospitalized or undergone any surgical procedure  and he does not have any history of congenital heart diseases or rheumatic fever. He doesn't remember ever having dental procedures without proper antibiotic prophylaxis. He's not on any chronic medication and he doesn't have known drug allergies.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Doe presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever (~39.5°C  103.1°F) for the past two weeks  associated with chills and rigors. He also complained of fatigue  loss of appetite  and weight loss. He mentioned feeling unusually short of breath  especially while performing his usual daily activities  and experiencing a mild  dull ache in his lower back which he initially attributed to his occupation as a carpenter. He also noticed a painless  red rash on his palms and soles that appeared over the past week.  He denies chest pain  palpitations  cough  night sweats  nausea or vomiting. He has not noted any changes in his urine or bowel habits or any joint pain or swelling. However  he does recall having toothache and underwent a dental procedure about a month ago.  Conclusion:  Based on Mr. Doe's symptoms and a history of recent dental procedures without prophylaxis  he's suspected to have infective endocarditis (IE). His condition could be a classic presentation of subacute bacterial endocarditis. His symptoms of fever  fatigue  and loss of appetite are non-specific but are often seen in IE. Presence of Janeway lesions (painless  red rashes on palms and soles) is another clue to IE. The combination of both cardiac (shortness of breath) and renal (lower back pain interpreted as flank pain) symptoms suggest possible systemic embolization  a known complication of IE. This case allows students to delve deeply into the various presentations and complications of native-valve infective endocarditis.

14,10,75,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial75,Patient Information:  Mr. Smith  a 52-year-old Caucasian man  is being assessed at our outpatient facility. He's a lifelong resident of the city  working as a construction worker. He has been married for 30 years and has two adult children.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith is a non-smoker and reports moderate alcohol use. He has a past medical history of rheumatic fever in childhood  but no history of intravenous drug use or recent dental procedures. His immunizations are up-to-date  and he typically enjoys good health. His maternal family history includes a history of structural heart diseases.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Smith reports a two-week history of feeling generally unwell but interpreted it as a prolonged flu. His symptoms have escalated over the past few days  including high fever  perspiration  weakness  fatigue  and weight loss. Additionally  he describes experiencing a continuous  mild  and dull chest discomfort  but no acute chest pain. He further reported discomfort in his lower back paired with joint aches but no visible swelling. He has also noticed tiny  flat  painless red spots under the skin of his palms and soles and occasional shortness of breath  particularly when climbing stairs or walking briskly.  Training Case Focus:  This patient's symptoms  history of rheumatic fever  and recent onset of non-specific symptoms such as fatigue  fever  and mild chest discomfort may indicate infective endocarditis. The presence of petechiae  the tiny red spots on his hands and feet  further strengthens this suspicion. Native-valve infective endocarditis (as opposed to prosthetic-valve) is indicated due to the lack of record showing valve-repair or -replacement surgery.  Next Steps:  Physical examination should include observing for additional signs of endocarditis such as Osler's nodes  Janeway lesions  or Roth spots. An echocardiogram and blood cultures should be ordered. If endocarditis is confirmed  a cardiologist should be consulted  and antibiotic treatment should be started. This case highlights the importance of considering past medical history  and non-specific symptoms while diagnosing.   The students should also keep in mind the broader differential for fever of unknown origin  including malignancies  autoimmune conditions  and other infectious diseases  and learn to systematically rule them out. Finally  they should consider the patient's lifestyle  profession  and family history in identifying potential risk factors for complex conditions such as infective endocarditis.
14,10,76,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial76,Patient Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. Rodriguez  a 68-year-old Hispanic male  Past Medical History: Known diabetic on oral hypoglycemic treatment for the past 8 years. Presents with a history of Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) from his childhood  for which he did not have regular follow-ups post his teen years. He is also a former smoker who has successfully abstained for the past decade but consumed alcohol socially until about a year ago. He has been inconsistent with his dental visits partly due to fear of oral procedures and partly due to his inability to afford them.  Chief Complaints: Mr. Rodriguez was brought to the clinic with fatigue  mild shortness of breath  low-grade intermittent fever  and weight loss continuing for the past three weeks. He also mentioned experiencing occasional night swea10ts and rapid heart rate episodes. He also emphasized that he recently started to experience overall weakness  especially during his routine activities. He also noted general malaise and decreased appetite.  These indicators are clues towards a possible infectious disease with systemic involvement. Given the patient's previous history of RHD and lack of oral care  a different diagnosis like native-valve infective endocarditis should also be suspected.  (Note: Remember this is a hypothetical case; real-life situations may call for different approaches based on available facilities  personnel  and patient specifics.)

This case is designed to enable medical students to diagnose and manage a case of native-valve infective endocarditis. The patient's rheumatic heart disease coupled with his recent dental procedure without appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis should prompt students to suspect infective endocarditis. Symptoms such as fever  chills  night sweats  weight loss  and a new murmur reinforce this suspicion. The patient's lower back pain and swollen  painful ankle are indicative of possible septic emboli  another common complication of infective endocarditis. As the patient also has a history of diabetes and hypertension  any treatment plan must take these conditions into account.
14,10,82,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial82,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian female known as Mrs. A. She is from a suburban community and is a retired schoolteacher. She has a history of occasional alcohol intake but denies smoking or drug use. She lives with her husband and has three adult children.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of rheumatic fever at the age of 15 with minimal cardiac sequelae  hypertension controlled with losartan 50mg daily  type 2 diabetes mellitus that is diet-controlled  and dyslipidemia treated with atorvastatin 20mg daily. She previously had a dental procedure two months ago where antibiotics were not administered prior to the procedure.  Key Complaints: Mrs. A presents to the emergency room with a two-week history of persistent  low-grade fever  tiredness  joint pain  and a recent onset of a new heart murmur pointed out by her primary care physician. She also noted a decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss of around 5 pounds over the same period. There have been occasional episodes of night sweats in the past week. The patient has a history of intermittent toothaches for two days following her dental procedure two months back  which was managed with over-the-counter analgesics.  In the past week  she has been experiencing difficulty breathing  especially when lying down or during exertion. There have been episodes of dizziness and palpitations as well. However  she denies chest pain  cough  nausea  or vomiting. She also indicates experiencing a mild  constant headache over the past few days along with some visual disturbances in the form of spots in her vision.  This case report could then proceed to clinical findings  diagnostic assessment  therapeutic interventions  and final outcomes to teach medical students how to approach  diagnose  and manage potential infective endocarditis in a patient.
14,10,83,diagnosis14-prompt10-trial83,Case Study: Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis   Patient Information: - Age: 64 years old - Gender: Male - Occupation: Retired company executive  Medical History: John  the patient  has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 10 years ago  managed by diet control and oral hypoglycaemic agents. He also has hyperlipidaemia for which he uses a statin. There is no history of surgeries  allergies or tobacco use. He consumes moderate amounts of alcohol socially. There is no family history of coronary artery disease or any other significant heart-related issues. Furthermore  John has no known history of intravenous drug use.   Presenting Complaints: John presents with a 2-week history of intermittent fever  fatigue  moderate unintentional weight loss  and night sweats. He also reported experiencing new-onset shortness of breath on exertion and dull aching pain in his lower back. John reported experiencing these symptoms progressively worsening over the course of several days.   On further enquiry  he also reported having poor dentition and recently had invasive dental procedures done without antibiotic prophylaxis. He denied any chest pain  syncope  orthopedic symptoms  or changes in bowel or urinary habits.   Assessment and Plan: The symptoms  especially when taken into consideration with John's recent dental procedures  are suggestive of native-valve infective endocarditis. The shortness of breath may be due to heart failure secondary to infective endocarditis.  For further confirmation  blood cultures should be drawn and a Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) can be ordered to identify vegetations on the valve  if any. If the TTE is negative but suspicion remains high  a Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) can be performed. If diagnosis is confirmed  antibiotic therapy should be started as per standard guidelines.  Teaching Point:  This case illustrates the importance of considering infective endocarditis in patients who present with unexplained fever  fatigue  weight loss along with a history of recent invasive dental procedure. The case also emphasizes the importance of addressing poor dentition and the use of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis before dental work in patients at risk. It also highlights the need for being observant and watchful  as early diagnosis and timely treatment significantly contribute towards better prognosis.
