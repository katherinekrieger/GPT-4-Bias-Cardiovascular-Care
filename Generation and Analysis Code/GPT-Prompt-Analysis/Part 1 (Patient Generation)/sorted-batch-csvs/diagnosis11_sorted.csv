11,1,1,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial1,"Patient Presentation  The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male  named John  who presents with severe  sudden onset chest pain. The pain is sharp and radiates to his back. He describes it as """"tearing"""" in nature. He also mentions experiencing shortness of breath and light-headedness. There is no history of trauma or heavy lifting immediately preceding the pain.  John has a significant medical history with multiple risk factors that are typical for aortic dissection. He has been hypertensive for over 15 years and is currently being managed with antihypertensive medications. Based on his medical records  his blood pressure control has been inconsistent  and his last BP reading during a recent follow-up visit was 150/90 mm Hg. Additionally  John was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia 5 years ago  and although he is on statins  his cholesterol levels are not within the optimal range. He has been a chronic smoker for the past 40 years and has a 30 pack-year smoking history.   There is no history of any invasive procedure or instrumentation that could potentially trigger an aortic dissection. The patient also denies any history of illicit drug use.   John had a myocardial infarction around 3 years ago and had undergone angioplasty. He has been on aspirin and clopidogrel  drugs to prevent clotting  since then. Despite being advised lifestyle changes and regular exercise post his myocardial infarction  John admits to his sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary habits.   His family history reveals that his father had succumbed to an aortic aneurysm at the age of 73  suggesting the possible familial clustering of aortic diseases.  In summary  this is a 67-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled hypertension  dyslipidemia  chronic smoking  previous MI  and a positive family history of aortic disease  presenting with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back  likely a manifestation of aortic dissection."
11,1,2,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial2,Subject Presentation:   The patient is a 65-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for untreated hypertension  smoking  and a history of familial aortic disease.   Chief Complaint and HPI:   The patient came into the emergency department complaining of a sudden and severe tearing pain in his chest that radiated to his back. He stated that the onset was abrupt and occurred approximately 2 hours prior during physical exertion. The pain worsened with deep breaths but did not change with position shifts.   Medical History:  His medical history reveals that he has been hypertensive for approximately 15 years  but he has been rather non-compliant with controlling his blood pressure  often missing his antihypertensive doses. He is also a long-term smoker with a 40 pack-year history  though he denies any respiratory symptoms to date. Additionally  the patient shared that his father had an aortic aneurysm at a relatively young age that was managed surgically.   Surgical and Family History:   His surgical history is unremarkable and includes only an appendectomy twenty years ago. His family history is significant for aortic disease  with his father having had an aortic aneurysm  and his older brother undergoing surgery for an ascending aortic aneurysm.  Review of Systems:   Other than the severe pain and slight shortness of breath  the patient denies any symptoms  including fever  cough  palpitations  dizziness  vomiting  or changes in bowel or urinary habits.  Physical Examination:   Vitals are notable for a blood pressure of 175/105 mmHg  heart rate of 95 bpm  oxygen saturations at 94% on room air  temperature is 37.1°C  and respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute. Chest auscultation reveals normal breath sounds bilaterally  and cardiovascular examination shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination is normal  but his lower extremities reveal a slightly weaker right-side pulse.   Impression:   The sudden onset of severe chest pain with radiation to the back  a history of hypertension  and a family history of aortic disease raise the suspicion for an aortic dissection. The patient will be started on antihypertensive therapy and sent for immediate imaging tests to confirm the suspected diagnosis. Prompt surgical consultation will be sought. 
11,1,3,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial3,Title: Aortic Dissection in a 67-Year-Old Caucasian Male with Prior Cardiovascular Health Issues  Introduction Good Afternoon/Morning  Today I will be discussing the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian male who presented with aortic dissection. This case is particularly interesting due to the patient's extensive cardiovascular history.   Patient's Background The patient is a recently retired man  with a past medical history significant for high blood pressure  hyperlipidemia  and a smoking history of 20 pack-years  although he quit ten years ago. He also lives a relatively sedentary lifestyle and has a family history of heart disease  with his father passing away due to myocardial infarction at the age of 70.  Presenting Symptoms The patient has reported sudden severe chest pain radiating to his back and exhibiting a tearing sensation  which began this morning. He also experienced some episodes of shortness of breath and fainting spells.   Clinical Findings Upon examination  his blood pressure differed between arms  and a diastolic murmur was heard over the aortic area  suggesting aortic regurgitation. The ECG showed nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities  but no signs of myocardial infarction. A Chest X-ray showed widening of the mediastinum.  Predictive Diagnosis and Tests Given the classic presentation  the differential diagnosis was aortic dissection. A CT scan confirmed the presence of an ascending aortic dissection  identifying it as a Stanford Type A dissection.  Hospital Course & Treatment The patient was started emergently on antihypertensive therapy to control his blood pressure and was subsequently taken to the operating room for reparative surgery. This comprised a replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve  following which his post-operative period was uneventful. The patient is currently involved in cardiac rehabilitation and is counseled to adhere to a heart-healthy lifestyle. His other risk factors are also being managed with medications.  Summary In summary  this case demonstrates the presentation and management of aortic dissection in a patient with significant predisposing factors. It underscores the importance of maintaining control over modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and the necessity of prompt diagnosis and treatment of this life-threatening condition.   Thank you.
11,1,4,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial4,Subject: Presentation of an Elderly Patient with Suspected Aortic Dissection  Introduction  Good afternoon. Today  we are discussing the case of Mr. John Smith  a 72-year-old African American male who presented to the ER complaining of severe and sudden onset chest pain radiating towards his back. The pain initiated while he was at rest.  Patient's Demographics  Mr. Smith is a retired schoolteacher  a long-time resident of Cleveland  Ohio  living with his wife. He smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years  quit smoking 10 years ago and has a regular alcohol intake. He is not known to engage in illicit drug use.  Past Medical History  Mr. Smith has a known history of hypertension  even on medication  for the last 10 years. He is also a Type 2 diabetes patient managed on Metformin for the last 6 years. Furthermore  he experienced a myocardial infarction three years ago. He had previously undergone a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery following the myocardial infarct. He was found to have moderately impaired renal function on a routine check-up held six months back but is not undergoing dialysis. He doesn't have any known allergies.  Family History  His father died at the age of 60 due to a cardiac event. His mother deceased at the age of 83 years from complications associated with Parkinson’s disease. His brother  aged 68  is alive and has a history of hypertension.  Pertinent Findings  On examination  his blood pressure was found to be markedly elevated (190/100 mmHg) and his pulse was slightly irregular. The clinical picture was further characterized by a difference in blood pressure between his two arms. An immediate CT angiogram revealed an intimal flap in the descending thoracic aorta in favor of a suspected aortic dissection.   Initial Impression  Mr. Smith's intense chest pain  elevated blood pressure  and imaging results suggest aortic dissection  likely a Stanford Type B given the location. Due to his advanced age  comorbidities  and significant cardiac history  Mr. Smith is at high-risk and will need immediate medical attention.   In Conclusion  Given his presentation and imaging  emergent therapy is required to manage the hypertension and relieve the pressure on the aorta. The high-risk nature of the patient necessitates close monitoring  and multi-disciplinary involvement for comprehensive care needs to be considered.
11,1,5,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial5,Patient Presentation:  I would like to present the case of Mr. Daniel Smith  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  who presented to the emergency department with severe  sharp tearing chest pain radiating to his back and interscapular area. He also reported experiencing profound shortness of breath  sweating and feelings of anxiety.  Mr. Smith is a known case of hypertension which was diagnosed 15 years ago  for which he is on a regimen of antihypertensive medications: Amlodipine 10mg and Losartan 50mg daily. He has been relatively compliant with his medications. However  he has a history of smoking  with 30 pack-years recorded. His family history is significant  with his father having passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 72.   Furthermore  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with Type II diabetes five years ago and has been managing this with Metformin 1000mg twice daily. He also endorses a history of moderate alcohol consumption  approximately 3-4 glasses of wine per week.  Mr. Smith worked as a construction manager until his retirement 3 years ago. He lives with his wife and has two adult children who are in regular contact.  In summary  Mr. Smith is a Type II diabetic with a long history of hypertension and smoking  factors that has placed him within the high-risk category for cardiovascular conditions. His current symptoms strongly suggest a condition such as aortic dissection  which requires immediate investigation and management.
11,1,6,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial6,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Smith is a 60-year-old African American male presenting today to the emergency department with a sudden onset of a severe sharp  tearing pain in his upper back moving to his chest  associated with a sensation of ripping  shortness of breath  and diaphoresis. His symptoms started approximately two hours ago and have not improved with rest or practice nitroglycerin.  Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a long-standing history of poorly controlled hypertension  despite being on a regimen of metoprolol and lisinopril. He also has a diagnosis of mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from a 40 pack-year smoking history  although he quit smoking ten years ago. Other significant medical history includes hyperlipidemia  controlled on atorvastatin  and a previous episode of unstable angina three years ago.  Review of Systems:  Upon further encounter  the patient described a syncopal episode at home immediately after the onset of his back pain. He denies recent illnesses or injuries. He noted a mild cough but no fever  chills  or any gastrointestinal  urinary  or neurological symptoms. Therefore  his review of systems was otherwise negative.  Family History:  His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 58. His mother  aged 85  has a history of stroke. He has one brother living with coronary artery disease  diagnosed at age 55. There is no known family history of connective tissue disorders or aneurysms.  Social History:  Mr. Smith is a retired postman  lives with his wife  and they have two adult children. He quit smoking ten years ago and endorses drinking alcohol socially. He denies any recreational drug use.  On Hypotheses:  Given his history of long-standing poorly controlled hypertension  his demographic profile  and his presentation  there is an immediate concern for aortic dissection.  Initial Examination:  Vitals: Blood pressure of 170/85 mmHg  heart rate of 100 bpm  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation of 92% on room air  and a temperature of 98.6 F.  Physical Findings: On physical exam  Mr. Smith appears anxious and diaphoretic. Pulmonary exam reveals decreased breath sounds on the left side. Cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm without murmur  rub  or gallop. There was no significant differential blood pressure between both arms.  Conclusion:  In conclusion  the vital signs  physical findings  and history of poorly controlled hypertension make aortic dissection a leading differential diagnosis for this patient. Immediate diagnostic imaging with computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest should be considered to establish the diagnosis. 
11,1,7,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial7,Slide 1: Patient Profile & Background   The patient is a 65-year-old African American male who currently resides in a suburban neighborhood in Maryland. He is a retired teacher and a Vietnam war veteran. He is married  his wife is still alive  and they have three kids aged 30  33  and 35. He does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. His occupation doesn't appear to directly contribute to his current medical condition  but the stress experienced throughout his career may be a contributing factor.  Slide 2: Past Medical History  The patient has a significant past medical history for the following conditions: hypertension (on medication for 15 years)  type II diabetes mellitus (10 years duration)  hyperlipidemia (7 years)  ischaemic heart disease (post-angioplasty 5 years ago)  and is a former smoker (quit 20 years ago).  Slide 3: Presentation of Findings   The patient reports experiencing sudden  severe pain in the chest  which is radiating to his back  suggesting the possibility of an aortic dissection. He also reports some dizziness and difficulty in breathing. His vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 180/95 mmHg and a heart rate of 110 bpm. His pain scale rating is a 9 out of 10 on the numerical rating scale.  Slide 4: Preliminary Diagnosis  Given the patient’s symptoms  demographics  and background  the preliminary diagnosis is aortic dissection. This is a life-threatening medical emergency that demands immediate attention. The clinical findings are consistent with this diagnosis: severe chest pain  radiating to his back  a high systolic blood pressure  and a rapid heart rate. Advanced age  hypertension  and history of heart disease are all known risk factors for aortic dissection.  Slide 5: Medical Management & Recommendation  The patient needs immediate medical intervention in order to stabilize blood pressure and decrease the velocity of left ventricular ejection  potentially preventing the progression of his aortic dissection. A combination of pain relief  antihypertensives and  depending upon the type and extent of dissection  possible surgical intervention may be warranted.   Please refer to a cardiovascular specialist for further management and follow-up. As per his condition  he should stay under doctor's observation until his condition is stable. This is a critical update on the patient's condition and coordinated  multidisciplinary care will be required to address his complex needs and hopefully ensure a positive outcome.
11,1,8,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial8,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Smith is a 67-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is also known to have a 30-year history of smoking  albeit he quit approximately 8 years ago. He is retired and lives with his supportive wife in a suburban neighbourhood.  Mr. Smith came into the emergency department complaining of sudden onset  severe chest pain radiating to his back that began approximately 6 hours prior. The pain was described as “tearing” in nature  rated 8/10  and was not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin which he reportedly tried at home from a previous prescription for angina.  Upon initial assessment  his anthropometrics include a height of 6’2” and weight at 235 pounds. Vital signs on presentation were blood pressure 165/105mmHg (right arm)  144/95 mmHg (left arm)  heart rate of 100 bpm  respiratory rate of 20 per minute  and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Physical examination revealed mild diaphoresis  but his heart sounds are normal with no appreciable murmur noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Given his severe pain and differential blood pressures  an aortic dissection is suspected. Further diagnostic protocols will be initiated promptly. The patient's family history is significant; his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 59. Mr. Smith's medications include atorvastatin 20mg at bedtime and lisinopril 10mg daily.  Among potential risk factors  uncontrolled hypertension stands out in this scenario  contributing to the possibility of aortic dissection in this gentleman. He has been educated on the seriousness of his condition  and the need for immediate investigations and potential intervention. The healthcare team is giving this case the priority and attention it needs  and every effort is being made to treat Mr. Smith urgently while ensuring his comfort and understanding of the situation.

Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient appears anxious and sweaty. Blood pressure readings show a significant difference between his right and left arms. His heart rhythm is irregularly irregular  and auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation.   In light of these clinical findings  combined with his history  an immediate imaging is warranted to further investigate the possibility of an aortic dissection.   In conclusion  Mr. Watkins' age  history of hypertension  family history of cardiovascular disease  and clinical signs strongly suggests aortic dissection  which requires immediate attention to prevent further complications."
11,1,10,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial10,Patient Presentation:  Today's subject is a 55-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. Smith  presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with aortic dissection. Mr. Smith is a slightly overweight individual  with a BMI of 26  who resides in the urban city setting of Minneapolis  MN. He visited the emergency room complaining of sudden  excruciating chest pain and shortness of breath.  Mr. Smith has a documented history of uncontrolled high blood pressure for the past 10 years. His history also reveals that he is an active smoker  smoking almost a pack of cigarettes a day for the last 30 years. Apart from these  he also has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  predominantly his father who passed away at the age of 58 due to a myocardial infarction.  Further medical history also includes the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol for 7 years  for which he is on oral medications. Unfortunately  Mr. Smith follows an unhealthy diet and has an inactive lifestyle. He confessed that he is non-compliant with his prescribed medication regimen for hypertension  diabetes  and high cholesterol and tends not to follow-up with his regular medical appointments.  In the past  he has been hospitalized twice due to unstable angina  but never had any surgeries till date. There is no history of allergies  mental health issues  or substance abuse  other than nicotine dependence.  Overall  Mr. Smith's presentation along with his demographic and medical history  hints towards a high risk for cardiovascular diseases  including aortic dissection. A prompt and thorough evaluation is required to confirm the diagnosis and to plan immediate management. This case also highlights the need for meticulous control of comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes  and the importance of smoking cessation to prevent serious cardiovascular events.
11,1,11,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial11,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male named John Doe. He lives independently in a suburban neighborhood. Until present  Mr. Doe has managed to maintain good health with no history of a smoking habit or illicit drug use. However  he has a known history of hypertension which has been managed with antihypertensive medications over the past ten years. Still  his blood pressure has not always been well-controlled  often due to poor adherence to the treatment regimen.   The patient was referred to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain  which he described as ripping and tearing  occurring over a period of about 30 minutes. He described the pain  which started at the anterior chest  as radiating to his back between the scapulae. The sudden start and severe character of the pain  along with the typical radiation pattern  raise suspicions for aortic dissection.  Other important details in his history include a family history of cardiovascular disease. His father passed away at 70 due to heart failure and his mother had her first stroke at 65. He has no history of surgeries.   Mr. Doe’s lifestyle could be described as sedentary  due to his job as a computer programmer. However  he does enjoy golfing during his leisure time. His diet often revolves around fast food  which along with his lack of routine physical exercise  has led to obesity. He enjoys an occasional drink over the weekends. No known allergies have been reported.  Until present  the most serious health-related issues he has experienced have been occasional cases of flu-like symptoms and a few instances of back pain treated with over-the-counter medicines.   This family history  along with his ongoing hypertension  obesity  and non-compliance with his prescribed hypertension regimen  increases Mr. Doe's risk factor profile for aortic dissection. An urgent diagnostic procedure is called for to confirm the diagnosis and implement immediate treatment.

11,1,16,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial16,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. John Smith  presenting with acute onset of severe chest pain  with the pain radiating through to his back. The pain commenced suddenly approximately one hour ago  and is described as a tearing sensation.   Patient Demographic Information:  The patient is a retired school teacher and resides in the urban area of Phoenix  Arizona. He is a non-smoker and moderate alcohol drinker. He is married  and is the primary caregiver to his wife who suffers from Parkinson's disease. The patient follows a balanced diet but leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith has a known history of hypertension that is generally controlled with Amlodipine and Lisinopril. He has been hypertensive for the duration of the past 15 years. John also experienced a minor ischemic stroke 4 years ago  with no residual deficits. He suffers from mild obesity (BMI 30.5). The patient has a familial history of cardiac disorders  with his father having succumbed to myocardial infarction at age 70 and his elder brother currently living with stable angina. John has no history of diabetes  hyperlipidemia  or kidney disease. His last visit to the clinic was 3 months ago for routine check-up  where he was generally deemed to be in good health. He has been in compliance with his medications and regularly follows up on his appointments.  Given the sudden onset of his symptoms and his background of hypertension  aortic dissection is highly suspected and immediate investigations are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and manage the patient accordingly. Prompt medical attention is advised as an aortic dissection can quickly lead to life-threatening conditions.
11,1,17,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial17,Patient Presentation:  Overview: Mr. Jones is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  who presents with severe chest pain described as tearing  radiating to his back  which began suddenly an hour ago. The pain is 10/10 in severity and is not associated with exertion or meals. He has never experienced a pain like this before. There are episodes of lightheadedness but no loss of consciousness.   Personal Background: He is a retired engineer  married with three grown children. He is a former smoker who quit 10 years ago after smoking a pack a day for 30 years. He reports moderate alcohol consumption and denies illicit drug use.   Past Medical History: Mr. Jones has a documented history of hypertension  for which he has been prescribed lisinopril  but admits he has not always been compliant with his medication due to side effects  predominantly cough. He does not have a documented history of high cholesterol or diabetes. His family history is significant for a father who died of a heart attack in his late 60s  and a mother with hypertension who is currently alive and well.  Physical Exam: On physical examination  his blood pressure is found to be elevated  with a difference noted between the right and left arm readings. His heart sounds are normal with no murmur or gallop. Lungs have normal breath sounds  and the abdomen is nontender with no palpable masses. There are no neurologic deficits on a quick neurologic examination.  Discussion: Given the nature of his symptoms  along with his medical history  the working diagnosis is aortic dissection. This is a life-threatening condition where the inner layer of the aorta  the large blood vessel branching off the heart  tears  and blood surges through the tear  causing the inner and middle layers of the aorta to separate (dissect). Immediate evaluation and intervention are absolutely necessary.   Next Steps: He will be admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and needs an immediate CT scan to confirm this diagnosis. Depending on the type and location of the dissection  he may require emergency surgical intervention or medical management to control his blood pressure and heart rate. Given his risk factors  he also needs aggressive management for his hypertension and reinforced education about medication compliance.
11,1,18,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial18,Patient Presentation:  We are discussing a 68-year-old Hispanic male named Mr. Gonzalez who has arrived at our emergency wing complaining of severe  tearing chest pain that has begun suddenly. He described the pain as starting in the chest  then radiating to his back. In addition to the chest pain  the patient also complained of shortness of breath and feeling dizzy.  The past medical history of Mr. Gonzalez is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been diagnosed with these conditions for over 20 years and has been on medication  including antihypertensives - Amlodipine and ACE inhibitor - Lisinopril  and a statin - Atorvastatin for cholesterol control. He also has a 30-year history of smoking  although he quit 5 years ago.   Mr. Gonzalez does not have any surgeries in the past. His family history includes father with a myocardial infarction at the age of 52 and a sister with hypertension. He regularly visits his primary healthcare provider for medication refills and routine check-ups. Before this acute episode  he has been fairly stable with good medication adherence.   Based on his severe chest pain  hypertension history  and other risk factors  we are suspecting aortic dissection. Immediate care has been initiated and diagnostic examinations are being conducted to confirm the diagnosis and further determine the extent of the dissection. 
11,1,19,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial19,Subject: Presentation of Patient with Aortic Dissection  Good morning/afternoon/evening   I would like to present a patient who is admitted to our hospital presenting with a condition known as aortic dissection.   The patient is Mr. Michael Sanchez  a 63-year-old Caucasian male  residing at 1234 Willow St  Trenton  New Jersey. Born on February 9  1959  in Salem  Massachusetts  he moved to New Jersey at the age of 32  where he has been residing since. He lives with his wife and has two grown children who live in different states.  Mr. Sanchez is a retired engineer  who has had a fairly active lifestyle. He is a non-smoker and takes alcohol occasionally. His dietary habits are non-vegetarian; he consumes moderate amounts of red meat per his wife. He has not followed a regular exercise regimen since his retirement approximately three years ago.  His past medical history reveals that he was previously diagnosed and treated for high blood pressure  which has been mostly under control due to regular medication and management. He has also been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia for which he is prescribed statins. Further  his medical records indicate a mild case of type II diabetes diagnosed five years ago  managed with oral hypoglycemics.   Mr. Sanchez visited the ER complaining of a sudden onset of severe chest pain  which he described as tearing or ripping  radiating to his back. The pain was unrelenting and didn't improve with rest. Accompanying symptoms included mild shortness of breath and light-headedness. These symptoms  along with the subsequent clinical examinations and imagings  led to the diagnosis of a suspected aortic dissection.  In conclusion  Mr. Sanchez’s current presentation  coupled with his history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  puts him at risk  necessitating immediate treatment and intervention for his aortic dissection. His management will require a multidisciplinary team approach  involving cardiology  cardiothoracic surgery  and  possibly  endovascular specialists.  Thank you for your attention. For any queries or necessary further discussion regarding Mr. Sanchez’s case  feel free to contact me. 
11,1,20,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial20,Patient Presentation  Patient Information: Our patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male named  Mr. King  residing at 89 Oak Street  Tulsa  Oklahoma.   Past Medical History: Mr. King was previously diagnosed with high blood pressure  which he has been managing with medication for approximately ten years. He was also diagnosed with Marfan syndrome in his late twenties  a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue. Additionally  he has a past history of tobacco use averaging about half a pack per day for roughly 35 years  but quit smoking five years ago. Besides  he maintains an overall sedentary lifestyle and has a history of excessive alcohol intake until the past two years.   Recent Clinical History: Mr. King presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe chest pain  described as a tearing sensation  radiating to his back. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath  fainting  and cold  pale legs. Furthermore  his blood pressure readings show significant inequality between both the arms.   Conclusion: Considering the past medical history  current symptoms  and the physical exam  our preliminary diagnosis is Aortic Dissection. Further investigations like Echocardiogram  CT scan  or MRI are required for confirming the diagnosis and initiating the suggested treatment plan and interventions as soon as possible.   Plan: Pending the results of the aforementioned tests  proposed subsequent steps include medical management to control blood pressure and potentially surgical intervention depending upon the type and severity of the aortic dissection. We should also consider referring our patient to a genetics counselor due to the presence of Marfan Syndrome. Patient education on lifestyle changes and regular disease management will be essential.
11,1,21,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial21,Patient Presentation:  We have a 67-year-old Caucasian male patient by the name of Mr. Bradley currently presenting with symptoms indicative of aortic dissection. He is of medium build  at 175 cm height and weighs 85 kg.   History of Present Illness:  The patient presents with sudden  severe chest pain radiating through to his back. He describes this pain as 'tearing' and reached peak severity within minutes of onset. Accompanying symptoms include excessive sweating  dizziness  shortness of breath  and a loss of consciousness observed prior to hospital admission.  Medical History:  Mr. Bradley has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension spanning many years. He also has a substantial smoking history  although he had quit smoking five years ago. He has a past record of myocardial infarction about a decade back  for which he underwent bypass surgery. He reports adhering to antihypertensive meds but does not take any other medications regularly. He has no known allergies. A family history reveals his father suffered from an aortic dissection at age 62 and his mother lived with ischemic heart disease.   Social History:  Mr. Bradley lives with his wife and is now retired after working as an account manager for 30 years. He stopped smoking 5 years ago after a history of heavy smoking for 40 years. The patient denies any usage of recreational drugs and reports occasional alcohol consumption.   Review of Systems:  On examination  pulse rates show significant discrepancies between both arms. Blood pressure measurements also show a significant difference between the left and right arms. He appears sweaty  pale  and is visibly distressed due to pain. There are no visible signs of Marfan syndrome or any connective tissue disorder. His lung and abdominal examination is normal  and no significant findings were noted neurologically.  Conclusion:  In summary  given Mr. Bradley's severe  acute onset chest pain  discrepancies in pulse and blood pressure between his bilateral upper extremities paired with his past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and family history of aortic dissection  a preliminary diagnosis of aortic dissection is suspected. Further diagnostic testing  including a CT Aortogram  will be required for confirmation. Prompt management is crucial to prevent fatal complications.
11,1,22,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial22,Patient Presentation:  Name: Mr. Davis  Gender: Male Age: 60 Race: African-American Occupation: Retired automobile worker  Chief Complaint:  Mr. Davis presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset  severe chest and back pain that started approximately 3 hours ago. He describes the pain as tearing and radiating to his back.  Mr. Davis is a smoker and has a 30-pack year history of smoking. He also has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the last 10 years. He doesn't have diabetes  but his cholesterol levels are elevated. He has no known allergies.   In his family history  his father died of a heart attack at the age of 63 and his mother had a stroke at her late 70s. He doesn't exercise regularly and follows an unbalanced diet.   On examination  his Blood pressure is found to be significantly higher in the right arm compared to the left arm. Heart sounds are normal. He displays signs of respiratory distress. There is no visibile trauma.  With the above details  given his sudden onset of severe chest pain  a long history of smoking and uncontrolled hypertension  he is suspect for aortic dissection. An urgent chest CT is ordered and it comes out positive for Stanford type B aortic dissection. Immediate medical management is started  consisting of rigorous blood pressure control and pain management. Consultation with cardiothoracic surgery has been arranged for potential surgical intervention.    In Mr. Davis's case  his aortic dissection can be attributed to his long history of uncontrolled hypertension  high cholesterol levels  smoking and poor lifestyle which are risk factors for aortic dissection. It is crucial to manage his risk factors and introduce lifestyle changes along with medical management to prevent further cardiovascular complications.
11,1,23,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial23,Presentation  I would like to introduce Mr. Smith  a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presented in the emergency department with severe  persistent and tearing pain in the chest radiating to his back. He is a well-respected businessman in our local community.   Mr. Smith has a documented history of hypertension for 20 years and he has been on anti-hypertensive medication  specifically ACE inhibitors. Furthermore  he has a known family history of cardiovascular disease. His mother  unfortunately  passed away due to acute myocardial infarction  and his father died due to stroke. He does not have any history of diabetes or any immunocompromised conditions. He is an active individual without any known allergies or intolerance to medications.  He has a smoking history of 40 pack-years and has a moderate alcohol intake. In recent days  the patient has been complaining about experiencing severe anxiety due to excessive workload stress. This anxiety has left him feeling quite on edge  and has led to difficulty in sleeping.  The patient’s primary concern currently is a sudden manifestation of sharp stabbing pain  which he rates as 10 on a scale of 10. The onset of pain was rather abrupt  and he describes it as the “worst pain he has ever felt”. He also reports sweating and feeling lightheaded.   The patient’s physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg on the right arm and 150/95 mmHg on the left arm. His pulse rate is 110 beats per minute and irregular. His lab values including cardiac marker tests  complete blood count  and kidney function tests are awaited.  The possibility of an aortic dissection is being pursued due to the patient’s history of hypertension and the presentation with tearing chest pain  unequal blood pressures in both arms  and irregular pulse. Further examination and confirmation by imaging modalities like CT angiography or transesophageal echocardiographies are planned. This diagnosis is suspected during hypertensive emergencies like hollow-organ rupture. Early identification and management can significantly reduce mortality and morbidity.
11,1,24,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial24,Presentation of Patient with Aortic Dissection  Patient Information: The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Johnson who has been brought into the emergency department by his wife due to sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient is a resident of Hudson  Ohio  and is a retired construction worker. He has been married for the past 32 years and is a father to two adult children. Mr. Johnson has a past history of smoking (approximately 20 cigarettes daily for 30 years) and occasional alcohol use.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a well-documented medical history of hypertension  having been diagnosed at the age of 40  with irregular control over the years. The patient also had hyperlipidemia and suffered a myocardial infarction five years ago  for which he underwent a successful coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient is currently on a regular medication regimen which includes a beta-blocker  ACE inhibitor  statin  and a daily aspirin. There is no family history of any cardiovascular or connective tissue diseases.  Presenting Complaints: During the initial assessment  Mr. Johnson complained of a sudden onset  severe  tearing chest pain radiating to his back  consistent with the pain typically associated with aortic dissection. He also complained of shortness of breath and diaphoresis. Prior to the onset of the symptoms  he was engaged in household chores that involved heavy lifting. Upon presentation  his BP was noted to be markedly elevated.  Given his presenting complaints  medical history  and lifestyle  it was concluded that Mr. Johnson’s condition might be an acute aortic dissection and appropriate tests have been ordered for confirmation and stratification of the severity. At present  Mr. Johnson has been kept under close observation and immediate steps have been taken to lower his blood pressure to prevent any further complications.

11,1,30,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial30,Title: Case Study - Aortic Dissection  Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  a 56-year-old African American male  was admitted to the ER at 2:00 PM today with severe chest pain. The pain was described as sudden in onset  sharp  and tearing  radiating to his back  mainly between the shoulder blades.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe is a known hypertensive patient on medication for the last 15 years. In addition  he has a 10-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes a day  although he quit smoking four years ago. He also has a reported case of high levels of cholesterol. There's no history of any known allergies  diabetes  cancer  or surgeries.   Family History: Mr. Doe's father experienced a myocardial infarction at the age of 62  and his mother had an ischemic stroke at 68. His younger brother  aged 51  is a diagnosed hypertensive as well. There is no known family history of aortic dissection.  Social History: A long-term resident of Virginia  Mr. Doe worked as a school teacher. He lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood and they have two grown-up children. He reports moderate alcohol use  primarily in the form of wine at dinner  and he exercises moderately  walking for half an hour at least four times a week.  Clinical Exam: On physical examination  his blood pressure was significantly different in both arms: 180/95 mmHg on the right vs 155/90 mmHg on the left. His heart rate was regular but fast at 105 bpm  and his respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute  indicating respiratory distress.   Presuming an aortic dissection  we immediately ordered diagnostic tests including chest X-ray and CT scan. As soon as the diagnosis gets confirmed  the patient will be prepared for further treatment including potential surgery.
11,1,31,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial31,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old African American male presenting to the Emergency Department with severe  tearing chest pain radiating to his back. The pain was abrupt  peaked within seconds and has persisted for approximately 3 hours. The patient also describes feelings of general malaise  faintness  and shortness of breath. He mentions having a syncopal episode at home. Vital signs upon presentation show hypertension with a recorded blood pressure of 170/110 mmHg  tachycardia  and signs of peripheral vasoconstriction. On physical examination  he showed decreasing peripheral pulses bilaterally.  Past Medical History:  The patient has had a long-standing history of Stage 2 hypertension managed with medication. He has type 2 Diabetes Mellitus which is well controlled with metformin. Additionally  he has been diagnosed with high cholesterol and is currently on a statin. The patient quit smoking a decade ago but has a 30-pack year smoking history. He has a family history of cardiac diseases.  This current presentation  combined with the patient's medical history  strongly suggests an acute aortic dissection. The abrupt onset of severe chest pain  along with the patient's significant cardiovascular history and associated risk factors  are all consistent with this potential diagnosis. Further diagnostic testing will be directed toward confirming the preliminary diagnosis.   Immediate intensive care and a multidisciplinary approach are required for the probable diagnosis of aortic dissection to prevent possibly fatal complications and to improve the prognosis. Given his history of hypertension  it is essential to aggressively manage this to reduce proximal aorta stress and prevent further propagation of the dissection.    (Further advice should be sought from cardiothoracic surgery. Definitive management will likely involve surgical intervention  pending the subtype of dissection.)
11,1,32,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial32,Title: Acute Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  resident of Houston  TX. His BMI is 31.5 kg/m2.  Chief Complaint: He came to the hospital with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the back.  Past Medical History: He has a previous medical history marked by uncontrolled hypertension (for about 20 years)  hyperlipidemia  and smoking (30 pack-years). He also had a myocardial infarction incident seven years ago and had been installed a coronary stent. No known drug allergies.  Family History: His family history indicates that his father died at the age of 65 from a possible ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Physical Examination: Upon presentation  the patient was visibly sweating and reports profound nausea. His vitals in the ER demonstrated a blood pressure of 170/90 mmHg  with a significant difference between right and left arm  heart rate 100 beats/min  respiratory rate 18 breaths/min  and SpO2 at 95% on room air. His heart sounds were normal while there was a slight murmur noted over the aortic region. Initial examination of the chest with stethoscope found no rubs or crackles.  Investigations: Initial EKG did not show any acute ischemic changes. Lab results reported high levels of D-dimer. A CT angiogram of the chest was carried out and reported an ascending aortic dissection starting just above the aortic root and extending to the level of the left subclavian artery.  Clinical Impression: The patient's signs  symptoms  and investigation results are suggestive of a Stanford Type A Aortic dissection  possibly precipitated by his long-term uncontrolled hypertension.  Plan: The patient is currently stabilized with tight blood pressure control and pain management. The case has been discussed with our cardiovascular surgery colleagues and they recommend immediate surgical intervention since this is a life-threatening situation. The risks and benefits of surgery have been explained to the patient who has given consent. He is scheduled for surgery tomorrow first thing in the morning.
11,1,33,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial33,Patient Presentation  Patient Information:  Mr. Richard Morgan  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented today with acute chest pain radiating to his back.  Demographic Information:  Mr. Morgan is a retired senior engineer  originally from Philadelphia. He is married with two adult children and resides in the suburbs. According to his records  the patient is a former smoker but quit 15 years ago. Further  he drinks socially  has a regular diet  and has no known drug allergies.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Morgan has a medical history of treated hypertension for the past 20 years  and he had a previous myocardial infarction in his mid-fifties  for which he maintains regular follow-ups with a cardiologist. Moreover  he has high cholesterol  which is being managed through dietary changes and Statin drugs. There are no noted chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus or kidney diseases. Furthermore  there is no relevant family history of genetic or cardiovascular diseases.  Current Presentation:  Mr. Morgan came to the ER complaining of sudden onset severe chest pain that initiated while he was in rest  which he describes as 'tearing' and has been persisting for 6 hours. The pain appears to have started in the anterior chest and then migrated to his back. The pain was not relieved with rest. He also mentioned experiencing episodes of light-headedness. His Blood pressure measurement indicated elevated levels on his right arm compared to his left. The EKG showed no signs of an acute myocardial infarction.  Impression:  Based on these findings  an imaging test was ordered to confirm the suspicion of aortic dissection. The acute onset of severe pain  discrepancy in BP between two arms  and his past medical history puts him in a higher risk category for this life-threatening condition. An immediate consultation with cardiac surgery was arranged as we wait for the radiologist's report. We will also need to control his blood pressure aggressively to reduce the risk of progression if aortic dissection is confirmed.
11,1,34,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial34,Patient Presentation  Our patient is a 67-year-old African American male presenting with severe chest pain radiating to the back  shortness of breath  and profuse sweating. The pain has been described as tearing or ripping and of sudden onset. His past medical history is significant for uncontrolled hypertension  a 30-year history of heavy smoking  and high cholesterol levels. Additionally  there is a family history of aortic syndromes. The patient also reports experiencing intermittent chest pain over the past month  which was initially presumed to be angina and treated accordingly.  In terms of lifestyle  the patient is a retired steel industry worker  lives with his wife  and has two adult children. He admits to occasional alcohol consumption but denies any illicit drug use. He also reports being non-compliant with his antihypertensive medication  which could potentially contribute to his presentation today.  Physical examination findings include blood pressure of 200/100 mm Hg  pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  and a difference in blood pressure readings between the right and left arm. He appears distressed due to pain and is jaundiced.  Further workup  including chest-Xray and CT angiography of the chest  will be essential to confirm the diagnosis of aortic dissection.   This patient's demographic info  lifestyle choices  and medical history should be factored into a comprehensive management plan aimed at immediate stabilization to prevent further dissection  blood pressure control  pain management  close monitoring  and potential surgical intervention depending on the type and extent of aortic dissection.  In conclusion  this is a classic case of aortic dissection  presenting with sudden onset severe chest pain in a patient with a notable history of uncontrolled hypertension and heavy smoking.
11,1,35,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial35,Presentation of a Patient with Aortic Dissection   Subject: Mr. John Doe  Age: 60 years  Race: Caucasian   Sex: Male   Occupation: Retired Engineer  Marital Status: Married  Presentation: Mr. John Doe  a 60-year-old Caucasian male presented with severe  sudden onset of chest pain radiating to his back.  Past medical history: Mr. Doe has a known history of hypertension which has been poorly controlled over the years. He also has a significant history of a heavy 40-pack year smoking habit  which he quit ten years ago. Diabetes Mellitus Type II was diagnosed five years ago and is managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. He also reported that his father died at a relatively young age due to an unspecified heart condition  suggesting a possible genetic component. There is no known history of collagen vascular disease  trauma or iatrogenic injury.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  the patient is hypertensive with a blood pressure of 180/100mmHg. There is a difference in the blood pressure readings between both the arms. The patient is in obvious distress  diaphoretic with increased respiratory rate.   The initial presentation and past medical history make an aortic dissection a high probable diagnosis. This case was further evaluated with a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan.   Remember  patients with aortic dissection usually present with a sudden  severe onset of chest or back pain  often described as tearing or ripping in nature. The pain often migrates as the dissection propagates along the aorta. Patients with aortic dissection are usually hypertensive due to a history of chronic hypertension. A history of connective tissue disease  a known thoracic aortic aneurysm  or a family history of aortic disease can make aortic dissection more likely.   In conclusion  Mr. Doe is a classic example of a patient at high risk for aortic dissection due to his uncontrolled hypertension  smoking history  diabetic condition  and potential family history of heart condition. A high degree of suspicion and prompt diagnosis and management can improve the survival rate among these patients.
11,1,36,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial36,Title: Clinical Case Presentation - Aortic Dissection  Patient Profile: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male named John  who is retired from a career in civil Engineering. It is important to highlight that John is a smoker and has been for approximately 40 years.  Presenting Complaints: John presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain that he described as 'tearing' and 'sharp.' The pain started in his chest and radiated to his back.  Associated Symptoms: John also reported feeling light-headed  experiencing shortness of breath  and some difficulties with swallowing. Furthermore  he developed sudden difficulty in moving his left arm  raising concerns for potential neurologic complication.  Past Medical History: Significant to note in his medical history are hypertension and hypercholesterolemia  both of which are well-controlled with medication. He also had a myocardial infarction five years ago  which led to a coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Moreover  John reported that his father had a “heart attack” at a similar age.  Current Medications: John is currently on Amlodipine 5mg and Lisinopril 10mg for his hypertension. Additionally  he takes Simvastatin 20mg for his hypercholesterolemia.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  John was in distress due to pain. His blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg and pulse 110 beats per minute  which were higher than normal indicating a potential hypertensive emergency. Initial neurological examination was suggestive of left-sided weakness. Cardiovascular examination revealed a somewhat disorganized rhythm  but no murmurs were detected.  Investigations and Diagnoses: An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed non-specific ST changes but no obvious signs of ischemia. A CT scan of his chest confirmed the suspicion of aortic dissection  showing a dissection beginning just above the aortic root and extending into the descending thoracic aorta. Given these findings  along with his symptoms and past medical history  John was diagnosed with an aortic dissection. An associated cerebrovascular accident (stroke) was also suspected  given his acute-onset left-sided weakness.  Management: Considering the nature of this diagnostic emergency  John was admitted to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Department for immediate surgical intervention.  This case underscores the high-risk nature of aortic dissections  especially in patients with a history of hypertension and heart disease. It's crucial that these patients receive swift and effective treatment to prevent fatal consequences.

Physical Examination: On examination  the patient was anxious  in distress due to pain  with a pulse of 105 bpm  blood pressure of 165/90 on the right arm  and 158/85 on the left arm  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and a temperature of 98.6 F. Cardiac exam revealed no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. The breath sounds were clear bilaterally. Pulse was palpable in all extremities.  Provisional Diagnosis: With this history and clinical presentation  a provisional diagnosis of aortic dissection is made. A CT scan is immediately ordered to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the type and extent of the dissection. Depending upon the subtype  the patient may need urgent surgical intervention or aggressive blood pressure control.   This case emphasizes the critical emergency nature of aortic dissection and the importance of early recognition and management."
11,1,38,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial38,"Patient Presentation:  We have Mr. Thomas Richter  a 64-year-old Caucasian male  presenting with sudden  severe chest pain that began about four hours prior to his arrival in the emergency department.  He describes the pain as sharp and """"ripping """" radiating to his back. He also reports dizziness and profuse sweating. He denies any nausea  vomiting  or shortness of breath. He reports a two-day history of untreated hypertension and notes that he has been experiencing stress at work.  His past medical history is significant for untreated hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 20-year smoking history  ranging from two packs per day. Furthermore  there is a family history of aortic dissection  with his father having suffered from the same condition at the age of 67.   Despite a longstanding prescription for antihypertensive medication  Mr. Richter reports inconsistent compliance and acknowledges that he hasn't taken his medication for the past three days. He also admits to the consumption of red meat and saturated fats in his regular diet  and he has been markedly sedentary due to his desk job.  Physical examination reveals elevated blood pressure (170/110 mmHg)  tachycardia (heart rate 100 beats per minute)  and his body mass index is calculated to be 28  indicating overweight status. Upon auscultation  a diastolic murmur is noted.  In conclusion  due to Mr. Richter's symptoms  medical history  and physical examination findings  there is a high level of suspicion for an acute aortic dissection  warranting prompt investigation and intervention."
11,1,39,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial39,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 66-year-old Caucasian male presenting with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his back. He describes it as a tearing  ripping sensation. He denies any history of trauma. The pain began while he was at rest and has not been relieved by rest or sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient also reports increasing shortness of breath and dizziness  but denies any nausea  vomiting  or sweating.  He has a past medical history of untreated hypertension and a 40-pack-year smoking history. The patient had a myocardial infarction 10 years prior  which was treated with balloon angioplasty and placement of a drug-eluting stent. His long term medications include: low-dose aspirin  metoprolol  and atorvastatin. 6 months ago  the patient's blood pressure was 160/92 mm Hg. The patient does not have a history of illicit drug use  alcohol abuse or any know inherited connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 58.  On physical examination  there was a blood pressure difference between arms  with left arm blood pressure lower than the right. Neurological exam was normal. Focused cardiac exam revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the right second intercostal space more suggestive of aortic regurgitation. Pulmonary  abdominal  and the remaining of the physical exam was unremarkable.   This history and presentation are suggestive of aortic dissection. The patient has been advised to undergo immediate diagnostic testing for confirmation of aortic dissection  including a computed tomography angiogram (CTA).
11,1,40,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial40,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old African American male presenting with the primary complaint of sudden and severe chest pain radiating to his back. In the ambulance  his blood pressure was found to be markedly higher than normal  presenting with 185/100 mmHg. He reports that the pain began suddenly whilst he was carrying his groceries  describing it as the most severe he has ever experienced.  Prior medical history reveals a chronic hypertensive case for the past 15 years which has been poorly controlled despite multiple medication adjustments. The patient has also been a smoker for the past 40 years. Laboratory results indicate raised LDL cholesterol levels. He has no known allergies but has familial history of cardiovascular diseases  as his father died due to a stroke and his elder brother has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. There is no history of diabetes mellitus or renal disorders.  Upon physical examination  he appears anxious and diaphoretic. Auscultation reveals a diastolic murmur  suggestive of aortic regurgitation. An electrocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy but no signs of ischemia or myocardial infarction.  The combination of the patient's symptoms  his history of uncontrolled hypertension  heavy smoking and family history predispose him to aortic aneurysms and dissections. Immediate investigations like computed tomography angiography (CTA) are warranted so that if aortic dissection is confirmed  this cardiovascular emergency can be assessed for surgery or endovascular therapy. The patient’s condition indicates a need for advanced cardiac life support and aggressive blood pressure control. 
11,1,41,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial41,Presentation of Patient with Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographics:  Patient Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 55 years Sex: Male Ethnicity: African American Occupation: Corporate Executive  Home Address: 123 Freedom Ave  Houston  Texas  Status: Married with 2 children Insurance: Private  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe is a known hypertensive patient under medication for the past 10 years. His hypertension has been poorly controlled over the past few months due to irregular clinic visits and inconsistent medication. He had a history of smoking for 10 years but quit four years ago. He is also diagnosed with high cholesterol and atherosclerosis two years ago. Family history is significant with his father having suffered from an aortic dissection at the age of 60.  Presenting Complaint:  John presented to the emergency department with severe and sudden-onset chest pain  which he describes as 'tearing' in nature radiating to his back. He also reported shortness of breath and intermittent dizziness. Upon examination  he showed signs of shock with pale and clammy skin  rapid pulse and low blood pressure.  Based on his presenting symptoms  history of hypertension  and family history of aortic dissection  a preliminary diagnosis of aortic dissection was made  and appropriate diagnostic tests were ordered immediately.
11,1,42,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial42,Title: Clinical Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographic Information: Mr. James Norton is a 68-year-old Caucasian male currently residing in the U.S. He is a former electrical engineer  now retired. His working history involves sitting for prolonged hours. He has been a dedicated smoker for past 45 years and also admits to excessive alcohol consumption.   Past Medical History: Mr. Norton was first diagnosed with hypertension in his early 40s  which has been managed with the help of Antihypertensives  specifically Lisinopril. During his late 50s  he also developed Type II diabetes and has since been on Metformin. In addition  he has experienced prolonged episodes of smoking induced chronic bronchitis through his 60s. The patient is also known to have hyperlipidemia  for which he is prescribed a statin.  Presenting Symptoms: Recently  Mr. Norton presented to the emergency room with sudden  severe chest pain that he described as tearing and radiating to the back. The pain started while he was lifting a heavy object. Accompanying symptoms included dyspnea  diaphoresis and anxiety. His vital signs showed high blood pressure  particularly in the right arm compared with the left arm  and he had a tachycardia of 110 beats per minute.   These symptoms  in combination with the patient's history of smoking  hypertension and chronic bronchitis  evoke concern for aortic dissection.   In conclusion  Mr. Norton’s advanced age  history of smoking  hypertension and hyperlipidemia significantly increase his risk for aortic dissection. Early identification of the aortic dissection and prompt intervention can potentially decrease the risk of catastrophic consequences such as aortic rupture  severe aortic regurgitation  or cardiac tamponade.
11,1,43,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial43,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 55-year-old African American male named Mr. Johnson presenting with sudden severe chest pain. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and radiating to his back  which started approximately three hours ago.  Mr. Johnson has had a long history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 15 years  which hasn't been appropriately managed due to a lack of regular follow-up. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and tobacco smoking for the past 25 years. He has no known allergies. Mr. Johnson's family history reveals that his father died of an aortic aneurysm at the age of 60.  Physically  he is obese with a BMI of 31  and appears in distress with a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg and a heartbeat of 110 beats per minute. His respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute  and his pulse oximetry reading is 95% on room air. Upon further examination  he appears to have unequal blood pressures in both arms. He has no associated symptoms of nausea  vomiting  or shortness of breath.  In conclusion  given Mr. Johnson's presentation  clinical examination  past medical history  as well as high-risk factors such as hypertension  history of hyperlipidemia  and smoking  aortic dissection is the primary clinical suspicion. He must receive immediate attention  and other diagnoses must be excluded. His medical management should include blood pressure and heart rate control  pain management  and likely surgical consultation depending on the type of dissection."

11,1,45,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial45,Patient Presentation:  Patient's Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 68 Years Old Gender: Male Occupation: Retired Engineer Race: Caucasian Marital Status: Married  Chief Complaint:  Sudden severe chest pain  History of Present Illness: Mr. Doe presents with acute-onset severe  tearing chest pain that radiates to his back. The pain started approximately 3 hours ago and has progressively worsened. He reports a decreased ability to move his right leg and hematuria. Prior to this  he had episodes of dyspnea and hypertension.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe is a known hypertensive for the past 15 years for which he is under medication. He also has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass surgery 4 years ago. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes a day since he was 20-years-old and has binge drank alcohol on the weekends. His father died of myocardial infarction at age 60.  Physical Examination: Vital signs are stable with the exception of hypertension (BP:170/110). Examination revealed weakness in the right lower extremity  decreased pulses in the right lower extremity compared to the left  and a harsh aortic regurgitant murmur along the right sternal border. There are no signs of peripheral cyanosis or peripheral edema.  Assessment & Plan: The symptoms  past medical history  and physical examinations suggest diagnosis of Aortic dissection. An immediate imaging study such as a CT angiogram is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the extent of the dissection. If the dissection involves the ascending aorta (Type A)  immediate surgical intervention is necessary. If it’s a Type B dissection (not involving the ascending aorta)  management usually involves aggressive blood pressure control. Consultation with vascular surgery and cardiology should be immediately initiated. The patient is to be admitted to ICU for close monitoring. His smoking and alcohol intake need to be addressed  and he should be encouraged to adapt healthier lifestyle habits in order to possibly prevent further cardiovascular damage.

He describes the pain as 'tearing' or 'ripping.' He also reported shortness of breath.  Past Medical History: The patient has a significant past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension for the last 10 years. He has also been a chronic smoker (20 cigarettes/day) for 40 years which accounts for his Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He was diagnosed with CAD 5 years ago and since then he has been on medications (Aspirin and statins). He also has mildly impaired renal function and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both managed with oral medications. There is no history of previous surgeries  but there is a family history of heart disease in his maternal grandfather.  Social History: Mr. Johnson is retired  living with his wife in a suburban community. He is a former automotive engineer. He stopped taking his antihypertensives regularly after retirement  citing forgetfulness and lack of routine as reasons. His alcohol consumption is infrequent and in moderation. His diet is primarily Western  high in saturated fats and red meats.  Examination Findings: Mr. Johnson's pulse was irregular on presentation  and his blood pressure readings were inconsistent between the two arms. His heart sounds were noted to be normal with no murmur. There was  however  noticeable abdominal pulsation. Chest auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds at the lung bases and an ECG showed non-specific ST and T wave changes.  Based on his symptoms  medical history  and examination findings  Mr. Johnson was suspected of having an aortic dissection - a serious condition that could be life-threatening. The patient was immediately sent to the radiology department for a CT angiogram to confirm the diagnosis  pending which the necessary protocol for aortic dissection was initiated.

11,1,50,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial50,Subject: Mr. John Roberts  62-year-old Caucasian male  Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back.   History of Present Illness: The patient describes the pain as a tearing sensation that started suddenly early this morning while he was in the bathroom. He rates it a 10 on a 1-10 scale and states that it is unlike any pain he has experienced before. Taking deep breaths or moving did not exacerbate or alleviate the pain. Accompanying symptoms include dizziness  shortness of breath  and nausea. He denies any history of trauma or injury preceding the pain.   Demographic Information: John is a retired high school teacher who lives with his wife in the city. He previously smoked for 20 years but quit 10 years ago. He admits to moderate alcohol consumption but denies any current or past illicit drug use. He has been relatively physically active until just recently.  Past Medical History: Hypertension controlled with medication (amlodipine 10 mg once daily) for the past 10 years. History of high cholesterol for which he is on atorvastatin 20 mg once daily. He had an episode of a heart attack four years ago but has been managing well post stent placement and is on aspirin 81 mg daily. No known drug allergies. Family history significant for father who died of a stroke at the age of 67.   Physical Examination: The patient is in obvious distress. BP is 160/90 mm Hg  pulse 98 bpm  and respiratory rate 24 bpm. On examination  he has diminished pulses in his right upper extremity. Cardiovascular examination shows a diastolic murmur heard best at the right second intercostal space.   Impression: Mr. Roberts' symptoms of sudden severe chest pain  hypertension  asymmetrical pulses  and a diastolic murmur suggest an aortic dissection  a potentially life-threatening condition. Further diagnostic imaging such as CT angiography or transesophageal echocardiography is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Immediate management should address blood pressure control to limit propagation of the dissection. The patient requires urgent medical attention  including likely surgical referral depending on the type and extent of dissection.
11,1,51,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial51,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 58-year-old African American male named Tom Johnson who presented to the emergency department earlier today with severe tearing and stabbing chest pain that began suddenly while he was at home. The pain radiated to his back.  His past medical history includes hypertension  which was diagnosed five years ago  and a thirty-pack-year history of smoking. He has been diligently taking his hypertensive medication  Lisinopril  but still struggles to quit smoking. The patient reports no other major health issues; he has never had any surgical procedures and does not have a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases. Moreover  he does not have any known drug allergies.   In terms of lifestyle  he reports moderate alcohol consumption  a high-sodium diet  and a relatively sedentary lifestyle with minimal exercise.   Given the severe  sudden onset of pain  his known history of hypertension  and the epidemiological data associating aortic dissections with middle-aged African American males especially with history of smoking and hypertension  an aortic dissection is highly suspected.  Further tests and imaging study are required for a confirmatory diagnosis. Prompt management is crucial as an aortic dissection  if present  can lead to serious complications and is a cardiovascular emergency.  The patient has been admitted to the emergency department for immediate evaluation and treatment.
11,1,52,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial52,Title: Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection   Patient's Profile: Mr. Mitchel Scott  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  with a residence in Houston  Texas  visited our emergency department on 6th of March  presenting severe chest and back pain. He is a retired bank manager who lives with his wife. He is a non-smoker but accepts having a moderate alcohol intake.  Medical History: Mr. Scott has been under regular medication for high blood pressure for the past ten years  which is otherwise uncontrolled. He has a known medical history of hyperlipidemia and also underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 5 years back due to coronary heart disease. He has been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus two years ago and currently on metformin. He has no known allergies to any medications. His family history includes his father who had an aortic aneurysm and his mother who died from stroke.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Scott complained of a sudden onset of ‘tearing’ chest pain  radiating to his back  and associated with sweating and breathlessness since early morning. He rated the pain as 9 on the pain scale. There was no report of loss of consciousness  palpitations  or paralysis.  Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. Scott was found to be afebrile but tachycardic with a heartbeat at 110 beats per minute and his blood pressure recorded was significantly different in both arms (right: 150/80 mm Hg  left: 130/75 mm Hg). His respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Upon auscultation  a diastolic murmur was noted. His abdomen was soft and non-tender  and there was no palpable pulse in the left femoral artery  suggesting pulse deficit.  Investigation and Findings: A chest X-Ray was ordered which revealed a widened mediastinum. An urgent CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of Type A Aortic Dissection  starting from the ascending aorta and extending to the level of Renal arteries  which explained both his severe chest pain and difference in blood pressure in both arms. Blood tests were generally unremarkable except for slightly raised D-dimer levels.  The patient was immediately started on medication to lower his heart rate and blood pressure  and referred for emergent surgical repair.  Further Management: Mr. Scott would continue with his antihypertensive  antidiabetic  and lipid-lowering drugs and would be under regular follow-ups once discharged after the surgery. He would be advised regarding lifestyle modifications  especially dietary regulations and stress management  to control his hypertension and diabetes.  Patient education would be provided about the signs and symptoms of potential complications such as aortic rupture or recurrent aortic dissection to ensure timely medical intervention.
11,1,53,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial53,Title: Case Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Introduction: Here we present a case of Mr. Robert Johnson  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  recently diagnosed with aortic dissection.  Demographics: Mr. Johnson hails from Austin  Texas and is a retired mechanical engineer. He lives with his wife in their home and they have two adult children who live out of state. His primary language is English  both reading and writing. He is non-smoker and consumes alcohol in moderation.   Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain  characterised as a sharp  tearing sensation that radiates to his back. He also reported shortness of breath  sweating  and fainting episodes. Initially  he mistook the symptoms for heartburn  but the escalating intensity of the pain forced him to seek immediate medical help.  Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension for the last ten years  for which he has been irregular with his medications. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago  which is moderately controlled with oral hypoglycemics. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) two years ago for triple vessel disease.  Family History: Both his father and older brother had cardiovascular disease. His father died at 65 due to a myocardial infarction and his brother had an aortic aneurysm rupture at age 72.  Current Medications: Mr. Johnson is currently on Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes  Lisinopril 10mg once daily for hypertension  and Aspirin 81mg once daily as a post CABG antiplatelet therapy.  On physical examination and diagnostic evaluation  signs consistent with aortic dissection were apparent. His blood pressure was found to be significantly higher in the right arm than the left. An urgent CT scan confirmed our diagnosis.  Conclusion: This case of Mr. Johnson highlights the importance of regular monitoring and control of hypertension as uncontrolled hypertension is one of the major risk factors for aortic dissection. It also emphasizes the need to be vigilant about chest pain  particularly in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease  to ensure timely management and potentially life saving interventions.

He describes the pain as sharp and """"tearing"""" in nature and reports that the pain radiates to his back.  Demographic Information:  Mr. Dawson is an automobile mechanic living in San Diego  California. He is married and lives with his wife. He is a current smoker with a history of 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 40 years. He is a moderate alcohol consumer  mostly on the weekends.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Dawson's past medical history is significant for hypertension  which has been poorly controlled over the past few years. He was diagnosed with this condition ten years ago but admits to having problems with treatment compliance. He reports no other significant medical illnesses and had his last complete health check a year ago.   Of note  he had undergone an appendectomy when he was in his twenties. His family medical history indicates that his father died of a heart attack in his early 60s  and his mother is alive with hypertension and type-2 diabetes.  Considering his medical history and symptoms  an aortic dissection is highly suspected requiring immediate investigations and management."
11,1,55,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial55,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Smith  a 65-year-old African-American male  comes in today with complaints of sudden onset severe chest pain that radiates to his back. The pain is described as tearing and ripping  increased with movement and breaths  not alleviated in any position  and 10/10 in intensity. In addition  He states that he feels light-headed with some nausea.  Mr. Smith has a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and tobacco use. He has been on treatment for these conditions but admits to inconsistent compliance with medications and an ongoing smoking habit. He is a retired construction worker and currently living alone. There are no known allergies. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  with his father and an uncle both having experienced myocardial infarctions in their sixties.  Key features of Mr. Smith's presentation such as the intense  tearing pain felt in the chest and the history of hypertension increase the clinical suspicion of aortic dissection. Further diagnostic testing is recommended to confirm this diagnosis. The patient's advanced age  male gender  smoking habit  history of hypertension and family history of cardiovascular disease certainly put him at an elevated risk for aortic dissection. His inconsistent compliance with his prescribed hypertension regimen underscores the importance of patient education and adherence to treatment protocols in managing chronic health conditions to prevent serious complications such as this.
11,1,56,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial56,Presentation of Patient:  The patient is a 70-year-old African-American male. He lives in a suburb of a big city in North Carolina and is retired. Patient is married and has three grown-up children. He was a long-time smoker for about 40 years until he quit 5 years ago.  Medical History:  The patient's past medical history indicates that he suffers from hypertension which he has been battling for about 20 years. He takes antihypertensive drugs regularly and his hypertension is relatively controlled. He also has hyperlipidemia for which he is on statins. He had heart attack (myocardial infarction) about 14 years ago  for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting to his left anterior descending artery (LAD).  Current Health Issue:  Currently  the patient is complaining of severe and sudden chest pain radiating to the back. Based on his symptoms  an EKG  and a CT angiography scan; he has been diagnosed with aortic dissection. The initial diagnosis was made in the emergency department where the patient came due to the severe onset of pain. The time from the occurrence of symptoms to his arrival at the emergency department was about 2 hours. The CT scan results showed an intimal flap in the descending aorta  confirming the diagnosis of type B aortic dissection.  Family History:  His father passed away due to stroke at 80  and his mother had diabetes mellitus type 2 and died due to complications at 76. His eldest brother died at 72 from congestive heart failure.  Overall  the patient is at a high risk due to his advanced age  history of long-term smoking  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and previous history of heart attack. He's currently stabilized  but it is critical to manage and treat his aortic dissection promptly owing to the risk of fatal complications.
11,1,57,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial57,Patient Presentation  Mr. John Doe is a 67-year-old African American male presenting with sudden severe chest and back pain radiating to his abdomen for approximately four hours. The pain was sudden in onset  tearing and sharp in nature and has persisted  becoming progressively worse. Accompanying symptoms include shortness of breath  profuse sweating  dizziness and nausea.   Mr. Doe has a past medical history of long-term  uncontrolled hypertension and a 35-year pack history of smoking. His long-standing hypertension has been complicated with poor adherence to antihypertensive therapy. He does not have a history of significant coronary artery disease  however he had a transient ischemic attack three years ago. Other significant medical history includes hyperlipidemia controlled on simvastatin  and type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease with his father having suffered a fatal myocardial infarction at age 55.  On examination  he is anxious with a blood pressure reading of 198/110 mmHg  a pulse rate of 110 bpm  respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. The patient's cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm without murmur  rub  or gallop. Mr. Doe denies any history of recent trauma or heavy exertion.  The emergency department physician suspects an aortic dissection given the patient’s complaint of acute  severe  tearing chest and back pain and his long-standing history of hypertension. Immediate radiological and cardiovascular consultation and intervention are warranted.   In this scenario  the patient’s risk factors include age  male gender  African-American ethnicity  history of hypertension  smoking  and his family history for cardiovascular disease.   Immediate treatment is required in order to stabilize the patient and prevent potential complications  such as organ damage from inadequate blood flow  aortic rupture  or stroke  all of which can be life-threatening conditions.

Summary:  Mr. Sullivan is a 62-year-old man with a past medical history significant for long-standing  poorly controlled hypertension  long-term smoking  stressful work environment  occasional heavy alcohol use  and atherosclerosis  presenting with classic symptoms of aortic dissection  such as sudden severe chest pain  shortness of breath  dizziness  and other associated symptoms. His family history of cardiovascular diseases puts him further at risk. Immediate medical attention and evaluation is needed for his case.   The information presented here has been collected during the patient's initial examination and should be used to inform further diagnostic evaluations and management approaches.
11,1,59,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial59,Patient Presentation:  Mr. X is a 62-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his back. The pain was described as 'tearing' in nature. Mr. X also reported symptoms of lightheadedness and fainting spell. He has failed to mention about any particular activity or event that proceeds his pain and reported no relief with rest or nitroglycerin  which he has been prescribed for his stable angina.  Past Medical History:  Mr. X has a documented history of hypertension for the last 15 years which appears to be reasonably but not optimally controlled. He also has stable angina and is 10 years post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He has a 40-year history of smoking  with an approximate exposure of 2 packs per day. He reported a strong family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father and older brother both suffering premature myocardial infarctions. Additionally  he also had a diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease. He appeared noncompliant with his prescribed medication regimen which includes a beta-blocker  a calcium channel blocker  an ACE inhibitor  a statin  and aspirin.   In conclusion  Mr. X's presentation of severe chest pain with a history of poorly managed hypertension  long-standing smoking  and additional cardiovascular risk factors gives a classic presentation of aortic dissection. Given that quick diagnosis and management is crucial to survival in these cases  a plan was quickly formulated to confirm the diagnosis and to manage appropriately.

11,1,62,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial62,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Charles Anderson  a 60 years old Caucasian male  has presented to the emergency department this afternoon. He is a retired school teacher living with his wife and has two adult children. Mr. Anderson is complaining of an intense and unrelenting chest pain that started a few hours ago while he was mowing the lawn  which he describes as “tearing” type pain radiating to his back. He is also reporting shortness of breath  dizziness  and sweating.   His vital signs show a blood pressure of 165/95 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 94% in room air. He appears very anxious and uncomfortable  showing distress related to his pain.  Regarding his medical history  Mr. Anderson has been diagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension for the past ten years and he is often non-compliant with his medications - Amlodipine and Lisinopril. He has a 40-year history of heavy smoking (1.5 pack per day) but he quit smoking around 5 years ago. He has no history of diabetes  stroke  or any heart diseases. His father passed due to aortic aneurysm at the age of 72 and his mother died of breast cancer at 70.  On physical examination  there is a significant blood pressure difference between his right and left arm. Heart sounds are normal  but a diastolic murmur was noted. His pulses are palpable  but weaker in his lower extremities. His lungs are clear on auscultation  although he seems having difficulty in breathing.   Based on the presenting symptoms  radiating pain  high BP  diastolic murmur  and his medical history  we are suspecting a possible aortic dissection. Urgent CT angiogram of the aorta is planned to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the dissection. Mr. Anderson has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring as his condition may rapidly deteriorate.   The patient and his family have been informed about his condition  potential complications  and the urgent need for invasive or surgical treatment depending on the classification of the dissection. Cardiothoracic Surgery has been consulted for potential aortic surgery. He also has been started on IV medication to manage his blood pressure and pain.

Mr. Bentley is alert  oriented  and cooperative. He has diaphoresis  pallor and appears in obvious discomfort. Upon auscultation  his heart rhythm is irregular with a systolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border. His lungs have normal breath sounds with no wheezing  rhonchi  or crackles. His abdomen is soft and non-tender. His lower extremities show no evidence of edema  and pulses are palpable bilaterally.   This clinical picture is concerning for a potential aortic dissection which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention.
11,1,65,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial65,Patient Presentation:  I present to you a 60-year-old Caucasian male patient Mr. John Simons who reports sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his back since 2 hours. He describes the pain as ‘ripping’ and ‘tearing’ in nature.  Mr. Simons is a retired mechanic and resides in NYC with his wife; he is a nonsmoker. His alcohol intake is minimal. He has no known allergies. He has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the last 10 years. He also has a concomitant history of Type II Diabetes Mellitus and hyperlipidemia. He underwent coronary artery angioplasty 5 years ago due to severe atherosclerosis. There is no family history of aortic aneurysm or connective tissue disease. He is currently on antihypertensive medication (Losartan)  Metformin for his diabetes  and statins for the hyperlipidemia.  The patient denies any syncope  shortness of breath  nausea  or vomiting. He has no leg or arm pain or weakness  and no numbness or tingling in extremities. His temperature is a normal 98.6°F  blood pressure is elevated at 170/95mmHg in right arm  165/90mmHg in left arm  heart rate is 88 beats/min  and his respiratory rate is 18 breaths/min. Physical examination reveals diaphoresis and distress due to pain. Lung and heart examinations are normal  except for a diastolic murmur. There are no indications of neurologic deficits or pulse discrepancies in upper or lower extremities.  Given his acute presentation of excruciating chest pain with a history of long-standing hypertension  the clinical suspicion is towards an aortic dissection until proven otherwise. Further investigations like a CT scan and D-Dimer test have been advised. We have started with the initial management of pain relief and blood pressure control  while he will be immediately referred to cardiothoracic surgery as per protocol for a possible emergent surgical intervention.   We are keeping a close monitor on his vital signs  ready to take necessary measures if there is clinical deterioration due to complications like aortic rupture  organ ischemia  or cardiac tamponade. The patient's family has been explained about the condition and probable interventions. They seem understanding and supportive  wishing to proceed with the best possible care for Mr. Simons.
11,1,66,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial66,Title: Presentation of Aortic Dissection  Patient Profile: Our patient is a 60-year-old African American male  identified as Mr. A  currently residing in Houston  Texas. He is an ex-smoker having quit 10 years ago but had a history of one pack per day for 30 years. He is a retired school teacher and lives with his wife. He does not have any known allergies.  Past Medical History: Mr. A has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which has been managed for the past 20 years with combination therapy of Lisinopril and Amlodipine. He was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 10 years ago  on regimen with simvastatin. Further  he has been a type 2 diabetic for the last 10 years  managed well on oral hypoglycemic agents. Mr. A survived a myocardial infarction 5 years ago for which he underwent percutaneous intervention and has been on dual-antiplatelet therapy since then along with regular cardiac evaluations. He had no known family history of cardiovascular disease.   Presenting Complaints: Mr. A presented to the emergency department with sudden severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain was described as 'tearing' in character and started at rest. It was associated with difficulty breathing  diaphoresis  dizziness  and mildly blurred vision. He denies any palpitations  syncope  or loss of consciousness.  Based on the presenting symptoms of severe and sudden onset chest pain radiating to the back  a high suspicion of acute aortic dissection was considered. The patient's history of uncontrolled hypertension further raises this suspicion. The patient is currently being evaluated to confirm the diagnosis and appropriate treatment options are being considered for further management as per the standard of care. 
11,1,67,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial67,Patient Presentation: We have a male patient  Mr. J  aged 60  Caucasian  married and a retired construction worker. He is a resident of North Bay City with his wife and two adult children.  Past Medical History:   Mr. J has a medical history of long-standing hypertension  which was mostly uncontrolled due to poor drug compliance. He has also been previously diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia. He has the occasional consumption of alcohol and was a former smoker but quit 10 years ago.   Family History:  He lost his father to myocardial infarction at the age of 53. His mother  alive and in her late eighties  is diabetic and hypertensive.   Current Episode:   Mr. J was brought into the emergency room with severe chest and back pain described as a tearing or ripping sensation  beginning suddenly and located in the upper back  moving rapidly to the front of the chest. The pain was followed by nausea  shortness of breath  sweatiness  and faintness. Blood pressure readings showed significant differences between the right and left arms. His heart rate was slightly elevated  and he displayed signs of shock.   Given his symptoms and history  an urgent echocardiogram was performed to confirm the suspicion of aortic dissection. Further management will be determined by the identified type of aortic dissection and its severity  taking into account his associated comorbidities and overall health status.
11,1,68,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial68,Subject: Patient Presentation - Aortic Dissection  Demographic Information: The patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian male who works as a long-haul truck driver. He is originally from Oklahoma City  Oklahoma  and currently resides in the same location. The patient is a smoker and has been for approximately 45 years. He consumes alcohol occasionally  about once or twice a month. He is married and lives with his wife  and they have two adult children.   Medical History: The patient has a past medical history of moderate hypertension and hyperlipidemia with a suboptimal degree of control due to medication non-compliance. He was diagnosed with these conditions about fifteen years ago but has been inconsistent in following the recommended treatment plan. In addition  he has had no previous surgeries or noteworthy hospitalizations. He has no known allergies to medications. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father having died from a myocardial infarction in his early sixties.  Current Presentation: Today  the patient presented in the emergency department  complaining of severe chest pain radiating to the back. Upon intake  his heart rate was 105 beats per minute  blood pressure was 170/110 mmHg  respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Initial assessment revealed a mediastinal widening in the chest radiograph  and an immediate CT scan of the chest confirmed the diagnosis of an ascending aortic dissection.  An ascending aortic dissection is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. The patient has been admitted to the hospital for surgical intervention  with the surgical team  the anesthesiology team  and cardiovascular care teams being notified accordingly.  To continue providing optimal care  it is crucial to ensure the delivery of effective pre-operative and post-operative care  compliance with medication  lifestyle modifications such as proper diet  quitting smoking and adequate exercise  as well as closely monitor blood pressure values in the long term. It is also important to offer psychological and emotional support due to the stressful nature of this life-threatening event  involving the patient's family as appropriate in the care plan and support strategies.
11,1,69,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial69,Title: Presentation of a Patient Presenting with Aortic Dissection  I. Demographics: Our patient  named Mr. Carlos Hernandez  is a 70-year-old man who is a native of San Antonio  Texas. He is currently residing with his wife in their home. Mr. Hernandez identifies as Hispanic  and he is a retired automobile mechanic. As for his social lifestyle  he used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day until 20 years ago and he averages at two drinks of alcohol every week. He leads a sedentary lifestyle.  II. Present Medical Condition: Upon admission to the emergency department  Mr. Hernandez presented with sudden severe chest pain  primarily on the front of his chest  which radiated to his back. The pain comes in waves  has a tearing sensation  and is different from any other form of pain he has endured in the past.  III. Past Medical History: Mr. Hernandez has a notable medical history that involves hypertension for which he is on medication. He has also been treated for hyperlipidemia and has occasionally forgotten to take his medications in recent months. Unfortunately  Mr. Hernandez was also diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus fifteen years ago  which has been reasonably controlled with metformin and dietary management.   Furthermore  he underwent a successful coronary artery bypass graft surgery for ischemic heart disease ten years ago. He has remained asymptomatic from the cardiac standpoint since. He also suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to his smoking history.  IV. Family History: There is a strong family history of cardiovascular disease in his family. Both his father and grandfather died of myocardial infarctions in their 60s. His mother had a stroke in her 70s. His two older siblings are both alive  with one brother suffering from hypertension and a sister being treated for type II diabetes mellitus.  V. Summary: In conclusion  given Mr. Hernandez's age  gender  racial background  personal medical history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  previous coronary artery disease  type II diabetes  and family history of cardiovascular disease  he is at high risk for aortic dissection. The abruptness of his chest pain and its characteristics further raises suspicion of dissection. Prompt evaluation and management are highly warranted to avoid complications.
11,1,70,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial70,Patient Presentation: Mr. Juan Richardson is a 65-year-old African American male presenting with sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the back coupled with episodes of shortness of breath. The pain is described as tearing in nature. Mr. Richardson was brought to the ER by his neighbor due to the intensity of the pain  which awakened him from sleep.   Demographics: Mr. Richardson  retired from teaching in a local high school  lives by himself. His wife passed away five years ago. He has two adult children living out of state. He has a history of smoking one pack a day for the past thirty years  but quit ten years prior. He drinks alcohol socially and has no substance abuse history. His exercise regime is limited  and his diet is high in salty and fatty foods.   Past Medical History: Mr. Richardson's medical records reveal a history of untreated hypertension  which has been difficult to control despite medication. He was diagnosed with high cholesterol five years ago and is under medication for it. There is also a family history of cardiovascular disease: his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70 and his elder brother has been diagnosed with angina. He has not been under regular medical care for the past few years. His record also indicates that he has type-2 diabetes and has been advised lifestyle changes  including regular exercise and low-fat diet. However  his adherence to the prescribed changes has been suboptimal. There are no known drug allergies or previous surgical histories.  The described presentation of sudden intense chest pain with a tearing character radiation to the back along with a medical history of longstanding  poorly controlled hypertension is highly suggestive of an aortic dissection. We will initiate immediate appropriate diagnostic workup  including a CT scan  to ascertain the diagnosis and determine the extent of the aortic dissection.
11,1,71,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial71,Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Doe  a 65-year old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department complaining of severe  sudden onset chest pain that is tearing in nature. The pain radiated from his chest to his back. Aside from pain  he also reported dizziness  shortness of breath  and weakness. His immediate family members confirmed that he looked pale and seemed in severe discomfort.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe is known to have a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and has been on treatment for the same. He is a chronic smoker with a history of smoking two packs per day for the past 40 years. He also has a history of moderate alcohol intake. He was diagnosed with stage 2 chronic kidney disease two years back but has not been on renal replacement therapy so far. There's no known history of diabetes mellitus. There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases- his father died from a heart attack at the age of 75 and his elder brother underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery at the age of 70.  On physical examination:  On examination  Mr. Doe appeared in acute distress. He had different blood pressures in his two arms (BP Right Arm: 180/110 mm Hg  BP Left Arm: 155/85 mm Hg) and auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur. Rest of the examination was within normal limits. The initial differential diagnoses considered were acute coronary syndrome  aortic dissection  and pulmonary embolism. He was immediately started on high flow oxygen  IV fluids  and pain management protocols.  Thus  with a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection given his age  gender  history of uncontrolled hypertension  and the nature and pattern of the pain  we recommend an urgent computed tomography (CT) scan to confirm the diagnosis and to guide further management.
11,1,72,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial72,Subject: Patient Presentation - Aortic Dissection  I would like to present a 67-year-old African-American male patient who has presented to our emergency department. He complains of severe tearing or ripping chest pain which started suddenly and has been progressively getting worse over the last two hours. The pain has radiated to the back  more predominantly on the left side.  The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension  which hasn’t been well managed  and smoking of approximately 1 pack/day for the past 45 years with no attempts at quitting. He also has a history of high cholesterol. However  there is no previous history of any heart-related problems  surgeries  or known allergies.  At presentation  his blood pressure was significantly higher in the right arm compared to the left. The patient appeared anxious and was profusely sweating. Breath sounds were diminished on the left side. His pulse was rapid  and an EKG revealed nonspecific ST and T wave changes.  This combination of symptoms  clinical findings  and past medical history points towards a strong possibility of aortic dissection. At this point  we shall proceed with further urgent investigations like Chest X-ray and CT angiography to confirm the diagnosis and understand the extent of the dissection.  Prompt diagnosis and management for this gentleman is imperative to prevent fatal complications such as rupture into the thoracic cavity and pericardium leading to cardiac tamponade  organ malperfusion syndromes  and aortic valve insufficiency. Furthermore  it is equally essential to manage his hypertension effectively in the long run and assist him with smoking cessation.
11,1,73,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial73,Presentation of Patient  I would like to present Mr. Larry Thompson  a 55 year old Caucasian male who presented with sharp and tearing chest pain radiating to his back. It's worth noting that Mr. Thompson has been a smoker for the past 30 years and has a history of uncontrolled hypertension.  Past Medical History  Mr. Thompson has a 10 year history of hypertensive heart disease  which has poorly controlled despite being on antihypertensive therapy. He has been non-compliant with his medication intake and lifestyle modifications. He was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease five years ago for which he has been receiving medical management. He is also a known diabetic for the past fifteen years and is on metformin. He admits to having a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in fats and cholesterol. He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia nearly five years ago. Familial history reveals that his father died of a heart attack at an early age.  In view of his presenting symptoms  clinical history  and physical examination  he was suspected to have an acute aortic dissection.  On physical examination  blood pressure was observed to be high in the right arm compared to the left. A grade 2 systolic murmur was audible along the left sternal border. His electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed some nonspecific ST-T wave changes but did not demonstrate any clear evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction. Subsequently  a computed tomography (CT) angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta (Stanford type A).  Mr. Thompson's case is urgent and high-risk  considering the type and location of aortic dissection in the context of his past medical history and ongoing uncontrolled hypertension. Early surgical consultation and management are recommended to prevent fatal complications such as aortic rupture  cardiac tamponade  or organ ischemia.
11,1,74,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial74,Patient Presentation:  We have a 62-year-old male patient named Mr. Jones who is presenting to the ER with a sudden onset of severe chest pain.  Mr. Jones is a long-term smoker and has a history of poorly controlled hypertension. He ran his own business and recently retired due to declining health. He is divorced and lives alone in a small apartment complex.  His past medical history is significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  obstructive sleep apnea  and a history of smoking for over 40 years. He denies alcohol use and illicit drug use. His family history is significant for heart disease and stroke.  Mr. Jones appeared in distress when he came to the ER. He complained of a sudden and severe tearing chest pain that radiated to his back  occurring 1 hour prior to arrival at the hospital.  His vital signs on admission were as follows: Temperature 37.2 degrees Celsius  Pulse 110 beats per minute  Respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute  Blood pressure 172/90 mmHg  Oxygen saturation 96% on room air. His body mass index is 31 kg/m2 which is included in the obesity category.  His complete blood count  electrolytes  coagulation profile  and troponin levels were ordered immediately  and a CT angiogram was performed urgently to confirm the diagnosis of aortic dissection.  The preliminary diagnosis from the patient's presentation  history of uncontrolled hypertension  and symptoms is aortic dissection. The patient has been started on IV beta-blockers to lower his blood pressure and heart rate and provided with pain management. The cardiothoracic surgery team has been consulted for possible surgical management. Mr. Jones will be admitted to ICU for close monitoring and further management. His condition is considered serious and life-threatening that needs immediate treatment.

The pain was described as 'tearing' and reached maximum intensity almost instantaneously accompanied by profuse sweating and nausea.  Past Medical History: He has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years and is a long-term smoker. He has a familial history of cardiovascular diseases - his father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 55 and his brother was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm at 58. The patient also has a history of Elevated LDL cholesterol levels and had a minor stroke two years ago.   Physical Examination: Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 185/95 mmHg in the right arm and 165/90 mmHg in the left arm  indicative of significant blood pressure discrepancy between both arms. His heart rate was tachycardic with a pulse rate measured at 115 beats per minute.   Considerations: Given Mr. Doe's symptoms  past medical history  and physical examination findings  the primary suspicion is aortic dissection. Accelerated hypertension and smoking might be his underlying risk factors in this scenario.  Next Steps: Immediate diagnostic investigations  including electrocardiography and imaging studies like CT scan and transesophageal echocardiogram  have been planned. Likewise  counseling has been provided regarding smoking cessation and better hypertension control through both pharmacologic therapy as well as lifestyle modifications.  Conclusion: Based on the above information  a swift and precise diagnosis of Mr. Doe's condition is crucial due to the high mortality rate associated with untreated aortic dissections. Appropriate and timely medical and surgical therapy can significantly improve the prognosis and survival rate.
11,1,78,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial78,Title: Case Presentation - Aortic Dissection  Demographic Information: The patient is a 63-year-old African American male named Mr. Johnson. He resides in Boston  Massachusetts  working as a car mechanic. He is a smoker with a 20 pack-year history. Mr. Johnson is married with two adult children and maintains an active lifestyle.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Johnson was admitted to the emergency department presenting severe and sudden-onset chest pain  radiating through to his back  for approximately three hours. The pain was tearing or ripping in nature. He initially mistook this pain for indigestion and dismissed it  but when the pain became unbearable  his wife called for an ambulance.  Past Medical History: According to his medical records  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago  which has been inconsistently managed due to noncompliance with medication and diet. He does not have any specific allergies to medications. He previously had no surgeries or major illnesses. He does not have any history of heart diseases in his family; however  his father died of colon cancer at the age of 75  and his mother passed away at 80 due to old age-related causes.   Social History: Mr. Johnson is a consistent smoker with a history of consuming approximately one pack of cigarettes per day  equating to a 20 pack-year history. He occasionally drinks alcohol but reports exercising regularly and eating a balanced diet in recent years.   Clinical Findings: On physical examination  his blood pressure was 160/115 mm Hg in the right arm and 145/95 mm Hg in the left arm  heart rate was 102 beats per minute  and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute. There was a noticeable decrease in pulses in the lower extremities. The patient's cardiovascular exam revealed an early diastolic murmur noted over the right second intercostal space  suggesting aortic regurgitation that is often seen with Type A aortic dissection.   This case presentation underscores the importance of early recognition and timely management of aortic dissection  given the serious implications this condition carries  particularly for patients with hypertension.
11,1,79,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial79,Title: Presentation of Patient with Aortic Dissection  Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening   Today we are discussing a 68-year-old Caucasian male patient who presents with a suspected aortic dissection.  Mr. Brown  a retired contractor  is an active and generally healthy individual with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both well controlled with daily medications- Amlodipine and Atorvastatin respectively. He has been a pack a day smoker for the past 40 years and has a moderate alcohol intake. He has no documented allergies.  The patient came into the emergency department reporting an acute onset of severe ripping or tearing chest pain radiating to his back  along with shortness of breath. He denies having a cough  fever  palpitations  nausea or numbness  and tingling. On examination  his blood pressure is found to be asymmetric with a difference of more than 20mmHg between his two arms. Other vital signs include a heart rate of 90 bpm and respiratory rate of 20 breathes per minute. Peripheral pulses are normal.  Of note  the patient has a family history of cardiac diseases  with his father having suffered an aortic aneurysm and his mother dying from a heart attack.  Given the acute presentation combined with his history of hypertension  the suspicion of aortic dissection is high  so he was immediately sent for a CT angiogram to establish the diagnosis and evaluate the involvement of the aorta.  The patient is stabilized with beta-adrenergic blocking agents to control blood pressure and reduce shear stress on the aortic wall  and further management will be determined based on the results of the imaging.  In conclusion  Mr. Brown's presentation is a classic example of a patient with a high risk of developing aortic dissection due to his age  sex  long history of hypertension  family history  and lifestyle factors such as smoking.
11,1,80,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial80,"Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: Mr. David Thompson  63-year-old Caucasian male.  Chief Complaint: """"Severe chest pain radiating to my back.""""  Current Problem: The patient is currently experiencing a sudden onset of severe chest pain that he describes as """"tearing"""" in nature. The pain started about two hours ago and has been persistent since the onset. He also mentions a history of high blood pressure.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension - diagnosed 10 years ago  irregularly managed with medication. 2. Smoking - approximately 20 cigarettes a day for the last 35 years. 3. High Cholesterol - diagnosed 5 years ago  controlled with statin therapy. 4. Family history of cardiac diseases - Father had aortic aneurysm; mother had MI in her 70s.  Physical Examination: On examination  blood pressure is noticeably higher in one arm compared to the other. The patient appears grimacing with pain  diaphoretic and is in apparent distress.  Presentation Summary: Based on the patient's acute onset of severe chest pain with a radiating nature  higher blood pressure in one arm  his history of poorly managed hypertension  high cholesterol  family history of cardiac diseases  and a long-standing smoking habit  there is a high suspicion for aortic dissection  an often deadly condition that needs to be immediately evaluated. The pain described by the patient is very characteristic of this condition and can be the body's way of indicating that the inner layer of the aorta has torn  allowing blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall  forcing the layers apart. This emergency condition can lead to aortic rupture  which has high mortality. Immediate diagnostic procedures  like a computed tomography (CT)  will be set in motion along with appropriate interventions including pharmacological therapies or possibly surgical."
11,1,81,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial81,Patient Information:   Mr. John Doe  a 60-year-old African American male  has presented himself to the medical facility today complaining about severe chest and back pain.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Doe is known to have a history of high blood pressure (hypertension) for the past 10 years which is being managed with medication. He is also a 20-pack-year smoker but quit about 3 years ago. He does not have any history of diabetes or chronic kidney disease. There is no known family history of aortic disease. However  he has a history of high cholesterol levels and has been on statins for the same.  Presenting Complaint:  Upon initial examination  the patient appears to be in severe distress. He describes the chest pain as sharp  worse than any he has experienced before  and radiating to his back. The pain commenced suddenly while he was at rest. He has associated symptoms of sweating (diaphoresis) and feeling of doom.   Given his presenting symptoms and medical history  it is crucial to note that he might be experiencing an aortic dissection  a life-threatening condition. Upon initial assessment  his blood pressure measurement shows a stark difference between both arms; indicates a discrepancy in pressure readings. He immediately needs more confirmatory diagnostic tests such as computed tomography (CT) scan  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  or transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).   Pending these confirmatory tests  he should be immediately started on aggressive medical management to lower his blood pressure and heart rate  in order to minimize further extension of the dissection. This patient meets criteria for surgical consultation due to the nature and location of dissection.

11,1,83,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial83,"Patient Presentation:  We are discussing Mr. John Doe  a 60-year-old African American male who presents with severe  sudden-onset chest pain radiating to his back. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and rates it as a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. Mr. Doe has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which has been poorly controlled despite management on multiple antihypertensives. He has a 20-year history of smoking  though has quit 10 years ago. He also has high cholesterol levels and a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father suffering a fatal heart attack at the age of 65.  On examination  Mr. Doe is in distress  clutching his chest. Initial vitals reveal a blood pressure significantly higher on the right arm when compared to the left  and his pulse is weak and irregular. Other physical findings include diaphoresis and pallor. On auscultation  there are also murmur and bruits heard  which were not previously documented.  Given his symptoms and physical examination findings  aortic dissection is strongly suspected. Emergency radiological tests  such as a CT scan and MRI  will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis and guide management strategy.  Mr. Doe is a classic case of high-risk demographic and premorbid conditions for aortic dissection. His uncontrolled hypertension  smoking history  hyperlipidemia  and family history of cardiovascular disease are all significant risk factors for this condition. This case underscores the importance of proper management and control of such conditions to prevent severe and potentially life-threatening complications like aortic dissection."
11,1,84,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial84,Patient Presentation  We present a case of a 63-year old Caucasian male with a history of poorly controlled hypertension  who came into the Emergency Department (ED) with severe chest pain. The patient is a retired teacher  and a non-smoker  social drinker and has no history of illicit drug use. The pain started suddenly about three hours prior to presentation and was described as a sharp stabbing pain radiating to the back. There is no history suggestive of fever  cough  or other systemic symptoms.  He has a documented medical history of hypertension  which has been controlled with medication for the past 15 years  though patient admits to having struggled with medication compliance resulting in persistent uncontrolled blood pressure. There is no history of any major surgical interventions or hospitalizations in the past. He reports no known drug allergies.   On further examination  blood pressure readings show significant discrepancy between both arms - with the readings being significantly higher in the right arm compared to the left. He also has an elevated heart rate (tachycardia)  but other vital signs including pulse oximetry and temperature within normal range.   In terms of family history  the patient’s father died at the age of 70 due to a sudden cardiac incident  though specifics are not known. His mother died at 85 due to Alzheimer's disease. He has one older sister who is alive and well.  Given the history and presentation  a preliminary diagnosis of Aortic Dissection is considered  and the patient is further evaluated with necessary imaging studies for confirmation. This case accentuates the critical importance of timely detection and apt management of hypertension  to prevent life-threatening complications such as aortic dissection.
11,1,85,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial85,Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 65-year-old  Hispanic male who presents to the emergency department with severe and sudden onset of chest pain  described as sharp and tearing  radiating to the back. He notes that the pain started about 3 hours ago. His medical history is significant for uncontrolled hypertension  heavy smoking for 40 years  and high cholesterol levels. He admits to occasional alcohol use. He has been noncompliant with his medication - Lisinopril - for hypertension. He denies any history of illicit drug use. Family history reveals that his father passed away at age 55 due to a myocardial infarction.  On physical examination  his vital signs are significant for a blood pressure of 190/110 mmHg  pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation of 92% on room air  and a temperature of 36.6 degrees Celsius. Further examination reveals a prominent pulsation of the right carotid artery and a weaker pulse in the left arm compared to the right. There is also differential blood pressure between arms. He appears anxious and diaphoretic.  ECG reveals no signs of myocardial infarction. Preliminary labwork including complete blood count  basic metabolic panel  coagulation profile  and cardiac biomarkers are pending.  An emergent CT angiography of the chest was performed showing a figure 3 sign indicative of an aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta  extending to the arch and descending aorta. This is consistent with a Stanford type A aortic dissection. The patient has been proposed for an emergent surgical intervention.  This gentleman's longstanding uncontrolled hypertension along with his smoking history likely contributed to the development of his aortic dissection. This case underlines the importance of aggressive and continual management of hypertension and cessation of smoking.
11,1,86,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial86,Title: A Case Study on Acute Aortic Dissection   Patient Presentation:   The patient is Mr. Donald Williams  a 62-year-old Caucasian male  who has been rushed to the ER with severe chest pain. He is married with an occupation as a civil engineer. He has a known past medical history of hypertension which has been moderately managed on ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. Besides  he has a 30-pack-year smoking history and is a known alcoholic. He does not exercise and has a family history of heart diseases.  Mr. Williams reported that the pain started abruptly while he was at work and described it as a sharp and tearing sensation that radiates to his back. He was also feeling short of breath. At the time of evaluation  his blood pressure was found to be significantly higher in one arm than the other.  He had tachycardia with a heart rate of 108 bpm and blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg on the right arm and 150/90 mmHg on the left arm. On examination  there was a discrepancy in pulse and blood pressure measurements in both upper limbs. He also has unequal pupils  lower limb weakness  and difficulty walking.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Mr. Williams was diagnosed with hypertension eight years ago and has been under medication since then. He is under ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. However  his hypertension was not optimally controlled.  2. Smoking: Mr. Williams has a 30-pack-year smoking habit. His exposure to nicotine and other potent chemicals in tobacco could have contributed to his increased risk for aortopathies.  3. Alcohol: Mr. Williams admitted to a history of heavy alcohol use. His drinking habit might have indirectly contributed to his uncontrolled hypertension.  4. Sedentary Lifestyle: Mr. Williams has a sedentary lifestyle that could have contributed to his hypertension and the lack of cardiovascular fitness might have compromised his ability to handle acute cardiovascular events.  5. Family History: He has a strong family history of cardiac diseases. His father and elder brother died of heart attacks in their 60s.  In conclusion  the clinical findings as well as medical and family history suggest the possibility of an acute aortic dissection in Mr. Williams. Further evaluation is necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

11,1,89,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial89,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Aortic Dissection  Patient Information Name: Mr. Smith Age: 67 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Demographic Information: Mr. Smith is a retired engineer who lives with his wife in their own home. They are capable of independent living and have occasional visits and support from their grown-up children. He is a former smoker and has a history of occasional alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith’s medical history reveals that he was diagnosed with hypertension ten years back and is currently on medication. He had a myocardial infarction five years back for which he was managed with coronary stents. He was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia three years ago and takes statin therapy to manage his cholesterol levels.  Recent Medical Issues: Over the last few days  Mr. Smith has been complaining of sudden severe chest pain that is radiating to his back. Other symptoms include shortness of breath  rapid pulse  loss of consciousness  cold sweats  dizziness  and nausea.    Preliminary Diagnosis: Based upon the medical history  presenting symptoms  clinical findings  and risk factors  Mr. Smith was suspected of having an aortic dissection. This is a serious condition in which the inner layer of the aorta tears  causing blood to surge through the tear  in effect causing the inner and middle layers of the aorta to separate.  Plan: He has been referred for further medical imaging including a CT scan and Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) to confirm the suspected diagnosis of aortic dissection. Depending upon the type and severity of the aortic dissection  Mr. Smith would need either surgery or medication management.  This is an urgent and serious situation. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can enhance survival rates and prognosis significantly.

The pain was described as severe  9 out of 10  and it began while he was lifting a heavy toolbox in his garage. He also reported feeling light-headed and sweating excessively  but denied experiencing any nausea  vomiting  or shortness of breath.  On examination  his blood pressure was found to be significantly different in both arms. His pulse was rapid and irregular. No obvious physical injuries were identified. Based on his symptoms  aortic dissection was suspected  and further tests such as CT  MRI and transesophageal echocardiogram were recommended to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the extent of the condition.
11,1,91,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial91,Patient Presentation 	 We are going to discuss the case of Mr. John Smith  a 67-year-old African American male  presenting with symptoms suggestive of aortic dissection.   Mr. Smith has been a resident of Florida for approximately 15 years  living with his wife  who reports that he had been experiencing severe chest pain radiating to his back for the past few hours. The pain was abrupt in onset and described as a tearing sensation. He further complained of shortness of breath  sweating  weakness  and light-headedness. His wife also reported that he had episodes of fainting.  Upon examination  his blood pressure was found to be elevated to 160/90 mm Hg  and his heart rate was 105 beats per minute. There was a difference in blood pressure observed from his right and left arm  indicating a likely case of aortic dissection.   His past medical history revealed that Mr. Smith is a long-standing hypertensive patient for about 20 years  with poorly controlled blood pressure. His records indicate a history of recurrent admissions due to hypertensive emergencies. He also reported smoking one pack a day for the past 30 years  maintaining a relatively sedentary lifestyle  and having a high cholesterol diet.   Furthermore  Mr. Smith was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome in his early thirties. Marfan Syndrome is a genetic disorder that impacts the body's connective tissue and poses a high-risk factor for aortic dissection.   In terms of family history  Mr. Smith's father died of a heart attack at the age of 70  and his paternal grandfather had a history of an aneurysm. Over the years  Mr. Smith has been non-compliant with his prescribed antihypertensive medications  raising his risk of a cardiovascular event such as this one.  In summary  Mr. Smith's current symptoms and past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  Marfan syndrome  a lifestyle including heavy smoking and sedentary living  and a family history of cardiovascular diseases all indicate a high probability of an aortic dissection. Further investigations  including imaging  are essential to confirm this diagnosis and to determine the extent of the dissection for appropriate management.

11,1,94,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial94,Title: Aortic Dissection in a 60-Year-Old Male Patient  INTRODUCTION:  Mr. X is a 60-year-old Caucasian male presenting with sudden onset sharp  tearing chest pain that radiates to his back. The pain started this morning while he was doing yard work and has been persistent  unlike any chest pain he has had before. The pain worsened with movement but was slightly relieved by leaning forward. He reports experiencing dizziness and shortness of breath  with no associated symptoms such as nausea or vomiting.  BACKGROUND:  The patient lives with his wife  leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle and has a 30 pack-year history of smoking — indicating he has consumed 30 packs of cigarettes a day for a year  stopped five years ago. He drinks socially and has no known drug allergies. He is a retired accountant with a strong family history of cardiovascular disease — his father died from a myocardial infarction at age 62.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Mr. X has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia both controlled with medications including Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. He had an episode of transient ischemic attack (TIA) two years ago but has had no sequelae. He has been treated for peptic ulcers ten years back. No history of surgeries.  RECENT HEALTH STATUS:  Most recently  his BP readings have been slightly elevated (150-160/95-100 mm Hg). General physical examination revealed a blood pressure disparity between the two arms with a moderately high heart rate. His remaining examination results are within normal limits. The working diagnosis based on the clinical picture is an aortic dissection  a condition which requires immediate attention.  CONCLUSION:  This case presentation highlights the classic symptoms of aortic dissection in a high-risk patient with a significant smoking history and a cluster of other risk factors  namely aging  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a history of TIA. An urgent diagnostic evaluation including imaging studies is being planned to confirm the diagnosis and initiate prompt treatment  given the life-threatening nature of aortic dissections.

He has no known drug allergies. His current list of medications includes Lisinopril  Amlodipine  and Atorvastatin. His immunizations are up-to-date.  In summary  he has several risk factors  such as his age  uncontrolled hypertension  smoking history  familial predisposition  and previous vascular incidents  likely contributing to his current aortic dissection. Immediate attention will be required to manage this life-threatening condition in Mr. Rivers.
11,1,96,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial96,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Aortic Dissection  Patient Details: The patient is a 56-year-old African-American male  who presented with a sudden onset of severe interscapular back pain radiating toward his abdomen. He is a resident of Austin city in Texas and is a non-smoker but has a significant history of alcohol consumption.  Past Medical History: He has a known case of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years. The patient was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus Type 2  around 5 years ago  which has been moderately controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. In addition  he has hyperlipidemia and he is on statins. No allergies were reported. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases with his father having succumbed to a myocardial infarction at the age of 62. The patient is not following any regular exercise regimen and his diet predominantly includes high calorie and high fat meals.  Presenting Complaints: The patient complained of a sudden onset  severe chest pain that started about two hours ago. The pain radiates to his back between his shoulder blades and seems to be tearing in nature. Further  he described a sensation of fullness in his chest. He also reported mild dyspnea and faintness along with profuse cold sweating. The patient denies any symptoms of palpitations  cough  or fever  but is experiencing significant anxiety due to the intensity of the pain.  Clinical Examination: On examination  his blood pressure was found to be significantly different in both arms. His pulse rate was irregular. Cardiac examination revealed a diastolic murmur. There were no signs of peripheral cyanosis  clubbing  or pedal edema.  Diagnosis: Based on the presenting symptoms  past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension  and clinical examination  an initial diagnosis of aortic dissection was made. Further diagnostic procedures including CT scan or a transesophageal echocardiogram will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to identify the extent and the type of dissection.   This is a very serious condition which requires immediate medical intervention to prevent life-threatening complications such as aortic rupture or organ damage due to interrupted blood supply. The management will however be determined by the type of dissection and other individual patient factors.
11,1,97,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial97,Title: Aortic Dissection - A Case Presentation   Slide 1: Patient Demographics The patient is a 67-year-old African-American male  Mr. J.K. He lives in Houston  Texas.  Slide 2: Occupational and Lifestyle Factors Mr. J.K. is a retired mechanical engineer and has been a smoker for the past 35 years. He has a history of strong alcohol intake  though he claims he has reduced the frequency over the past 5 years. Mr. J.K. has a sedentary lifestyle with no regular exercise habit.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Mr. J.K. has a significant past medical history which includes hypertension diagnosed 15 years ago  for which he is on antihypertensive medication. He has also been diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 10 years ago and is on oral hypoglycemic agents. He underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery 8 years ago due to ischemic heart disease.   Slide 4: Current Presentation Mr. J.K. presented to the emergency room with sudden onset severe chest pain that began 2 hours ago and radiated to his back  not relieved by resting. The pain was 8/10 on the pain scale and he reported feeling a 'ripping' sensation.   Slide 5: Clinical Examination Upon physical examination  he appeared to have significant pain and distress  diaphoretic and pallor. His vital signs showed pulse 98 (irregular)  BP 140/105 mm Hg (right arm)  120/80 mm Hg (left arm)  temperature - 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit  SpO2 - 90% on room air. The cardiovascular examination revealed a diastolic murmur  heard best over the right second intercostal space. His distal pulses were symmetric and equal in all four extremities.  Slide 6: Possible Diagnosis and Plan The clinical presentation  vital signs  and physical exam findings suggest an acute aortic dissection. The significant difference in blood pressure between his two arms is of notable concern. The immediate plan is to manage his pain  request an emergent CT angiogram to confirm suspected diagnosis  and consult cardiothoracic surgery.  Slide 7: Discussion and Conclusion The overall management strategy for Mr. J.K.  his treatment options  prognostic factors  implications for his chronic illnesses  as well as lifestyle modifications will be discussed  based on the diagnostic findings. This is a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention and has a high mortality rate. The patient’s history of hypertension  smoking  and previous heart surgery likely contributes to the increased risk for aortic dissection.
11,1,98,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial98,Title: Case Presentation - Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographics:71-year-old African-American male.  Presenting Complaint: Sudden  sharp chest pain radiating to the back  Medical History:  The patient has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 15 years  usually with systolic blood pressures in the range of 160-170 mm Hg. He also has a 30-pack-year history of smoking  though quit 5 years ago. He has Type 2 diabetes mellitus  for which he is on metformin. He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and has been on statins for this. There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases; his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 64.  Personal and Social History: He has a history of smoking but quit 5 years ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally but denies any illicit drug use. He is retired and lives with his wife.  Examination: On arrival  his vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 190/110 mmHg  a pulse of 110/min  respiratory rate of 20/min and temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius. On physical examination  his cardiovascular system revealed asymmetrical blood pressures in the upper limbs  diastolic murmur of aortic insufficiency  and reduced pulses in the lower extremities. Other systems appear unremarkable.  Impression: The patient's symptoms  combined with his medical history and physical findings  are highly suggestive of aortic dissection. His uncontrolled hypertension and smoking history are risk factors for aortic dissection. Further evaluation with imaging studies like CT angiography will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment plans.   Management and Follow-Up: The patient is immediately started on antihypertensive medication (beta-blockers) to control his blood pressure and is monitored in the intensive care unit. The results of the imaging studies will determine the course of further action (i.e.  whether surgical or non-surgical). The patient and his family are educated about the severity of the condition and the importance of adequate blood pressure control. Long-term follow-up plan will also include strict blood pressure control  regular monitoring of aortic size  and lifestyle modifications.
11,1,99,diagnosis11-prompt1-trial99,"Patient Presentation:  Our patient is a 63-year-old African American male presenting with complaints of a sudden and severe sharp pain radiating to the back. He describes it as a """"tearing"""" sensation in his chest area. The pain began abruptly about two hours ago while he was carrying groceries into his house. He also reported experiencing bouts of lightheadedness  shortness of breath  and profuse sweating. Upon physical examination  there was noted to be a significant blood pressure differential between the right and left arms with the right arm having a higher BP. The patient's heart rhythm was irregular  suggesting possible atrial fibrillation  while his breathing pattern was normal.  Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago but has not consistently taken his prescribed medication and does not follow up regularly with his primary care physician. Hypertension has been severe and poorly controlled. He also has a history of heavy tobacco usage for over 40 years but quit smoking 5 years ago. He has no known allergies. His father had died of a stroke at the age of 67 while his mother had passed away due to heart disease at her early 70s. As per his medical records  there's no history of previous surgery or complications noted.  In brief  the patient's symptoms  as well as his history of hypertension and tobacco usage  raise a high level of suspicion for aortic dissection. An emergency CT scan is recommended to confirm the hypothesis and to provide details of the dissection's anatomy."

This spike can be fatal if not diagnosed early and treated promptly. Today  we'll discuss a patient who was presented with this condition.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired mechanical engineer and has lived in the urban area of our city for about 30 years. He is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic but has been diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol levels in the past.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for 20 years. 5 years ago  he was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia  but he has been non-compliant with his medications. He has no known allergies.      Slide 4: Symptomatology The patient initially presented with acute chest pain radiating to the back  described as a tearing or ripping sensation. The pain onset was sudden and severe. Moreover  he reports experiencing shortness of breath  excessive sweating  and anxiety.  Slide 5: Physical Examination Upon physical examination  there was a difference in blood pressure between the two arms. He had a weak pulse on the right side compared to the left. A diastolic murmur heard over the aortic area was another crucial finding.  Slide 6: Diagnosis  The diagnosis was confirmed with a chest X-ray which showed widening of the mediastinum and a CT angiography demonstrated a dissection flap in the ascending aorta.   Slide 7: Treatment and Care The patient underwent immediate endovascular surgery to repair the aortic dissection. He was started on intravenous beta-blockers to control his blood pressure  for better management of the aortic dissection. He was also referred to a dietitian for cholesterol management.  Slide 8: Prognosis & Follow-up  Prognosis efforts are favorable if the aortic dissection is treated immediately. The patient is currently on a follow-up plan with medication adjustments for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been referred to ongoing cardiac rehabilitation and a lifestyle modification program.  Slide 9: Conclusion  This case underlines the importance of regular follow-up and medication adherence  especially in patients with chronic conditions like hypertension and hyperlipidemia. It also demonstrates the need to recognize the symptoms of severe conditions like aortic dissection  which can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early.   End of Presentation.

Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mr. X has had recurring episodes of hypertension that have been managed with medication over the years. Additionally  he has been smoking for approximately 25 years and has had occasional episodes of chest discomfort.  Slide 4: Presenting Complaints  The patient had been experiencing severe chest pain  which he described as sharp and tearing  radiating to his back. The pain onset was sudden and he stated it was the worst pain he has ever experienced.  Slide 5: Clinical Diagnosis  With the patient’s history of hypertension  smoking  and the characteristic description of his pain  a provisional diagnosis of aortic dissection was framed.   Slide 6: Diagnostic Investigations  Tests ordered include ECG  Chest X-ray  Blood Tests  CT angiography and Transesophageal echocardiography. The tests revealed an enlarged aorta and blood flow outside the normal pathways in the aorta  confirming aortic dissection.  Slide 7: Pathophysiology of Aortic Dissection  Aortic dissection is characterized by a tear in the aorta's inner layer  resulting in the separation (dissection) of the aorta’s middle layer from the inner layer  creating a false lumen. Risk factors include uncontrolled hypertension  smoking  and age.  Slide 8: Current Management  The main objectives in managing aortic dissection are to alleviate the pain  slow down the heart rate to reduce aortic wall stress  and prevent complications. The patient was immediately started for pain management and antihypertensive therapy. Surgical intervention was recommended due to his aortic enlargement.  Slide 9: Prognosis and Follow-up  The patient was informed about the severity of aortic dissection and the necessity for continuous monitoring and medication adherence even after surgery.   Slide 10: Conclusion  Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition which necessitates immediate medical attention. Long-term management involves stringent control of hypertension  adhering to medication instructions  routine follow-ups  and lifestyle modifications  especially smoking cessation.

Introduction  Today  we will discuss an illustrative case of an aortic dissection that demonstrates the complexity of its diagnosis and management.  II. Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male from a suburban community.  III. Past Medical History  He is a noted smoker with a 30-pack year history  and suffers from hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has no known food or drug allergies. His family history reveals his father died from an aortic aneurysm at the age of 65.  IV. Presenting Complaints  His complaint was a sudden onset high-intensity chest pain which began while he was doing yard work. He described the pain as a tearing sensation located in the middle of his chest and radiating towards the back. There were no accompanying symptoms of nausea or shortness of breath.  V. Clinical Examination and Diagnostic Findings  Upon physical examination  there was evidence of unequal blood pressures in both arms. An immediate echocardiography revealed an intimal flap in the ascending aorta  correlating with Stanford type A aortic dissection. A CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis.  VI. Management and Progress  He was immediately started on antihypertensive medication to maintain his systolic blood pressure between 100 and 120 mmHg and his heart rate below 60 bpm. The goal was to decrease the sheer force on the aortic wall. As this was a proximal (type A) dissection  he was considered for immediate surgical repair  due to the high risk of complications like rupture or organ damage. The surgery  a replacement of the ascending aorta  was successful  and there were no postoperative complications.   VII. Follow-Up  The patient was discharged on postoperative day 14 with orders for dual antiplatelet therapy  along with continuation of antihypertensive medication. He is enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program and is regularly followed up at our cardiovascular clinic.  VIII. Conclusion  This case effectively demonstrates that an aortic dissection is a life-threatening emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment. It also underlines the critical value of meticulous medical and surgical management in ensuring favorable patient outcomes. The patient's symptomatology  past medical history  and diagnostic findings all played a pivotal role in the timely diagnosis and treatment of this condition.

Slide 3: Past Medical History  This patient has a notable medical history including uncontrolled hypertension for which he is prescribed medication but reports non-compliance with the prescribed regimen. His history also shows borderline diabetes mellitus  a family history of cardiovascular diseases  and has been identified as experiencing moderate levels of chronic stress. No known history of surgery.  Slide 4: Physical Examination  On examination  he is found to be hypertensive (blood pressure 180/110 mmHg). His body mass index is within the overweight range. The patient appears anxious and in distress. Cardiovascular exam reveals a diastolic murmur best heard at the second right intercostal space.   Slide 5: Diagnostic Findings  Based on symptoms and medical history  suspicion of aortic dissection is raised. EKG results displayed no sign of a heart attack. CT angiography confirms an ascending aortic dissection  and his D-dimer levels are elevated.  Slide 6: Management  Emergency surgical intervention is required due to the specific location of the dissection. Pharmacologic measures are initiated to lower blood pressure and reduce heart rate (beta-blockers) while awaiting surgery to lessen the shear stress on the aorta.  Slide 7: Conclusion  This case emphasizes the importance of a high suspicion index for aortic dissection in patients who present with severe chest pain  especially those with a history of hypertension. It stresses the crucial nature of medication compliance  early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention when managing acute aortic dissections.   Slide 8: Prevention and Long-term Care  Discussions about lifestyle changes including smoking cessation  controlled alcohol consumption  healthy eating habits  and regular exercise are initiated. The patient is also advised to maintain regular follow-ups to monitor blood pressure control and heart status  adherence to the medication regime and overall progress.

11,3,98,diagnosis11-prompt3-trial98,Title: A Case Study on Aortic Dissection  Slide 1: Introduction Aortic dissection refers to a serious condition that involves a tear in the inner layer of the aorta wall  the large blood vessel branching off the heart. This tear allows blood to surge into the wall causing aortic dissection.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  a retired teacher who currently lives alone. He is a non-smoker and occasional drinker. He lives a sedentary lifestyle with an elevated body mass index (BMI).   Slide 3: Past Medical History The patient has a medical history of unmanaged hypertension  high cholesterol levels  and a familial history of cardiovascular diseases. He was diagnosed with Stage 1 hypertension approximately 10 years ago but has a poor record of medication adherence.  Slide 4: Presentation of Symptoms The patient presented with a sudden severe chest pain that he described as 'tearing' in nature. This pain radiated to his back  accompanied by shortness of breath  sweating  and dizziness.   Slide 5: Initial Diagnosis Based on the symptoms and his medical history  an initial diagnosis of aortic dissection was considered. An emergent chest X-ray was performed  showing a widened mediastinum.   Slide 6: Confirmation and Classification A CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis showing an intimal flap and false lumen  classifying the condition as Stanford type A aortic dissection. This classification is further supported by the symptoms presented.  Slide 7: Treatment Approach Due to the severity and classification of the dissection  an immediate surgical intervention was initiated  consisting of an open repair with a synthetic graft. Concurrently  the patient was administered medication to manage his blood pressure and reduce his heart rate.  Slide 8: Prognosis and Recuperation  The patient responded positively to the treatment with noticeable improvement. It is crucial for the patient to adhere strictly to his medication regimen  engage in consistent monitoring of his blood pressure  and make necessary lifestyle adjustments such as diet modification and regular exercise to prevent recurrence.  Slide 9: Importance of Early Detection This case underscores the importance of early detection and intervention in aortic dissection. Primary healthcare providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients  particularly hypertensive individuals  who present with unexplained severe chest or back pain.  Slide 10: Conclusion Aortic dissection remains a medical emergency with high mortality rates if untreated. Prompt diagnosis  surgical intervention  and tailored lifestyle modifications are key to long-term patient survival and reducing risks of future cardiovascular events.

11,3,100,diagnosis11-prompt3-trial100,Title: Aortic Dissection: A Clinical Case Analysis  Slide 1: Introduction  Today we will delve into a clinical case of a relatively rare but life-threatening condition known as aortic dissection.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics   Our patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  working as a retired engineer. A former smoker has had hypertension which was diagnosed ten years ago.  Slide 3: Past Medical History   Previously  the patient has suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years and had a history of chronic hypertension  poorly controlled. No previous surgeries or allergies have been reported.  Slide 4: Current Presentation   The patient presented to the ER with sudden  severe chest pain which he described as “tearing” in nature  that started at his chest and radiated to his back.  Slide 5: Physical Examination & Diagnosis   On physical examination  he was found to be hypertensive with a blood pressure of 170/105 mmHg. He also showed slight differences in pulses and blood pressure between the upper limbs. Echocardiography and computed tomography (CT) scan were used to confirm the diagnosis of aortic dissection.  Slide 6: Condition Overview  Aortic dissection is a serious condition in which a tear occurs in the inner layer of the aorta  allowing blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall. This can further lead to complete rupture or insufficient blood flow to various organs  both of which have serious consequences.  Slide 7: Risk Factors  Major risk factors for aortic dissection include hypertension  smoking  and age  which mirrors our patient's profile accurately.  Slide 8: Management  The first step in managing aortic dissection is to control blood pressure and alleviate pain  typically with IV medications. In this particular case  the patient was given intravenous labetalol. The decision whether or not to proceed with surgery depends upon the type of aortic dissection  which in this case is a type B dissection  managed conservatively with aggressive blood pressure control.  Slide 9: Long-Term Prognosis  Provided successful management of BP and lifestyle modification (cessation of smoking  controlled diabetes  regular follow-ups)  patient outlook can be fairly optimistic. Regular imaging studies are proposed for ongoing surveillance.   Slide 10: Conclusion  This case demonstrates the importance of early recognition and immediate management of aortic dissection  particularly in patients with high-risk factors such as uncontrolled hypertension  advanced age and a history of smoking.   Slide 11: Question and Answer  This slide opens space for questions  reflections  and further discussion about the case presentation.

11,6,12,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial12,Patient Profile:  Name: John Smith Age: 67  Gender: Male  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired engineer  Residence: Urban area  Marital Status: Widowed No. of children: 3 grown up  living separately   Past medical history:  - Patient has hypertension for the past 10 years. The blood pressure levels have occasionally been poorly controlled throughout this period. - He was diagnosed with high cholesterol 6 years ago. - Smoking history of 30 years  1 pack of cigarettes daily. Ceased smoking 5 years ago.  - History of Ischemic Heart Disease  diagnosed 4 years back  managed conservatively due to elevated surgical risk.  - Family history of cardiovascular diseases; Father died due to myocardial infarction  elder brother has heart disease.  Presenting Complaints: John visited the emergency department with an acute onset severe chest pain which he described as 'tearing' in nature  radiating to his back. The pain started suddenly while he was resting at home.  Observations at presentation: - Blood pressure: 165/95 mmHg; Pulse: 110 beats/min; Respiratory rate: 22 breaths/min. - Reduced pulse in the left arm compared to the right. - Audible diastolic murmur.    tentative Diagnosis: The quick onset of severe chest pain  often described as 'tearing'  and the deviation in pulse between his extremities might suggest aortic dissection. His age  male gender  hypertension  smoking history  high cholesterol level  and family history of cardiovascular diseases are consistent risk factors for aortic dissection.  However  further studies such as Chest X-ray  computed tomography (CT) angiogram  and/or transesophageal echocardiogram are needed to confirm the diagnosis.  Management: Immediate management would involve controlling blood pressure with medications like β-blockers or sodium nitroprusside  relieving pain using opioids  and potentially surgical management depending on the type of dissection and his hemodynamic stability. This will be followed by long-term management including control of blood pressure  regular follow ups  and possible lifestyle modifications.   It's important to stress that this is a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention as it can lead to life-threatening complications such as stroke  organ failure  or cardiac arrest.

The pain was 10/10  radiated to the neck  and was not relieved with rest. Other symptoms include shortness of breath  heavy sweating  and light-headedness. He denied any recent trauma to the chest or back.  Given the patient’s history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  previous myocardial infarction  and familial risk factors  he is at increased risk for conditions like aortic dissection  which should be considered in the differential diagnosis.   Further initial assessment and confirmation through imaging studies such as a CT scan or MRI should be done immediately to confirm the diagnosis  determine the extent of the dissection  locate the entry site  and establish the involvement of branch vessels. Management and treatment should be guided by the findings of these studies and the patient's overall condition.   The patient's lifestyle factors such as a high-sodium and high-cholesterol diet  lack of exercise  and previous history of smoking also add to his cardiovascular risk. Note that a referral for lifestyle modification counseling  including diet and physical activity  should be considered as part of the comprehensive management of his health condition.

11,6,21,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial21,Problem Representation:  Patient Description  A 62-year-old male presents with sudden onset  severe chest pain radiating to the back. He is overweight with a BMI of 30 and is a consistent  heavy smoker. The patient describes the pain as tearing and the most severe he has ever experienced.  Health History  The patient has a history of hypertension  which has been poorly controlled despite being on antihypertensive medications. He also reports a family history of cardiovascular diseases  specifically mentioning his father died of an aortic dissection at an early age. He has past medical records indicating the presence of a bicuspid aortic valve which was diagnosed 5 years ago during a routine check-up.  Risks Factors and Lifestyle  The patient leads a sedentary lifestyle with little to no physical activity. His dietary habits are poor  and he consumes alcohol intermittently in high amounts. He sleeps an average of 5-6 hours a night and often feels stressed due to work.  Physical Examination  On physical exam  significant findings include a systolic blood pressure of 180 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg. He also has a discrepancy in bilateral upper limb blood pressure. Auscultation of the chest reveals an early diastolic murmur.  Investigations  Lab tests indicate markedly elevated D-dimer. An emergent CT angiography is advised to confirm the suspected diagnosis.  Patient Concerns  The patient expresses concern about his condition as it is causing him debilitating pain and discomfort. He is quite anxious about the potential implications on his life and work.  Treatment Consideration  The patient has a known allergy to penicillin  which should be considered during the administration of any antibiotics if needed. Urgent blood pressure control is necessary to prevent further dissection.  Overall  this case represents a patient with multiple risk factors for aortic dissection  including family history of cardiovascular disease  poorly controlled hypertension  smoking  obesity  inadequate sleep  high stress levels  and sedentary lifestyle. His signs and symptoms  along with his physical examination and history  indicate a likely occurrence of an aortic dissection.

Demographics: - Name: Mr. John Doe - Age: 65 years - Sex: Male - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired army officer - Living Situation: Lives alone  II. Chief Complaint: - Severe chest pain radiating to the back  onset was sudden   III. Medical History: 1. Documented Hypertension: Mr. Doe has had high blood pressure for the last 15 years  managing it with antihypertensive medications. 2. History of Smoking: Mr. Doe was a heavy smoker - 2 packs per day for about 35 years. He quit smoking five years ago.  3. Marfan Syndrome: Mr. Doe was diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome  a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue  in his 30s.  IV. Cardiac History: 1. Previous Aortic Aneurysm: Mr. Doe had an ascending aortic aneurysm five years ago that was successfully treated with endovascular surgery. 2. High Cholesterol: Under the management of statins for primary prevention. 3. Cardiac Medications: Antihypertensive drugs (beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors)  Statins   V. Family History: - Father died of a heart attack at the age of 60 - Mother suffers from hypertension and diabetes  alive at 90  VI. Social History: - Alcohol: Occasional drinker  about two glasses of wine per week - Illicit Drugs: Denied - Physical Activity: Engages in light walks daily  VII. Review of systems: - Cardiovascular: Positive for severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and fainting spells - Respiratory: Negative for cough  wheezing  hemoptysis - Gastrointestinal: Negative for abdominal pain  nausea  vomiting  or bowel changes - Neurological: Negative for headache  numbness  tingling  or weakness in any part of the body - Musculoskeletal: Negative for joint pain  muscle pain  or swelling - Endocrine: Negative for weight loss  heat intolerance  cold intolerance - Dermatological: Negative for rashes  lesions or pruritus - Other symptoms: Negative  Based on this information  it seems that John’s history of hypertension  Marfan Syndrome  aortic aneurysm  and smoking could potentially attribute to aortic dissection. His age  genetic disorder (Marfan Syndrome)  and the fact that he is of the male gender also put him at a higher risk. The pain he is experiencing could be an indication of the tearing of the inner layer of the aorta wall causing the inner and middle layers to dissect. His health should be assessed immediately to prevent complications such as internal bleeding and organ damage.
11,6,26,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial26,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 68-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset severe chest pain that started two hours ago. The pain is tearing in nature  radiates to the back  increases in severity with time  and is associated with shortness of breath.  Relevant Past Medical History: The patient has a 20-year history of hypertension which is poorly controlled. He also reports a history of smoking about one pack per day for the past 35 years. He has high cholesterol levels and has been diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease three years earlier. His father died from aortic dissection at the age of 72.  Interpretation: The demographic data and history make him a high-risk patient for an aortic dissection. All of the risk factors including hypertension  family history  smoking  high cholesterol  and peripheral arterial disease contribute to the likelihood of this condition. The clinical presentation of sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the back  which increases with time and is associated with shortness of breath is highly suggestive for dissection of the aorta. Immediate evaluation and intervention is necessary to prevent life-threatening complications.
11,6,27,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial27,Problem Representation:  A 65-year-old African American male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension and a 50 pack-year smoking history presents to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset  severe back pain described as tearing and radiating to the front. Patient also reported a history of Marfan's syndrome  diagnosed in his early twenties  but has not seen a healthcare provider for a regular check-up in at least ten years and is not receiving any type of ongoing medical care or medication.   Physical examination revealed a difference in blood pressure between the right and left upper extremity  and a diastolic murmur heard best at the right second intercostal space. His body mass index (BMI) was 35  indicative of obesity  and lab studies indicated hyperlipidemia. He confirms non-compliance with prescribed anti-hypertensives due to forgetfulness and states that he has not checked his blood pressure in months.  In summary  the patient is a 65-year-old African American male  a heavy smoker  obese with an uncontrolled blood pressure who presents with symptoms suggestive of aortic dissection. He has a background of Marfan's syndrome  uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His social history includes minimal healthcare engagement and non-compliance with medications. He lives alone and his support system is unknown. His resource limitations could impact successful ongoing management of his cardiovascular conditions.   This case is complicated by a history of multiple major risk factors for aortic dissection including uncontrolled hypertension  obesity  a significant smoking history  hyperlipidemia  and having Marfan's syndrome. The recent onset of severe back pain radiating to the front  as well as the observed blood pressure differences between his limbs and diastolic murmur are classic symptoms of this potentially life-threatening event. An urgent evaluation and appropriate intervention will be needed.

11,6,32,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial32,"Patient Representation:  Client Data: Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old African American male  presents with severe chest and back pain.  Presenting Complaint: Patient reports that the pain occurred suddenly  is very sharp in nature  and seems to be radiating to his back  near the spine. Described as being the """"worst pain"""" he has ever experienced.  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension: Diagnosed 8 years ago 2. Smoking: 30 pack years 3. Type 2 Diabetes: Diagnosed 5 years ago  Family history: His father passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 68 and his elder brother has had a stroke.   Medications:  1. Lisinopril for hypertension  2. Metformin for diabetes  Allergies:  No known drug allergies.  Social History: The patient lives alone and is a retired mechanic. He smoked for about 30 years but quit 5 years ago. He reports drinking alcohol occasionally.  Review of Systems:  Patient reports feeling light-headed with the onset of the pain. Denies any associated shortness of breath  vomiting  fever  or cough. Reports generalized weakness over the past couple of weeks.  Physical Exam: On examination  the patient appears distressed due to pain. Blood pressure is found to be significantly different in both arms  and his pulse rate is rapid. Fine crackles heard on lung auscultation may suggest fluid leakage due to possible aortic disruption. Neurological examination reveals no focal deficits.  Lab Results: Pending  Impression: The patient's presentation is suspicious for an aortic dissection. The sudden onset tearing chest pain  history of long-term hypertension  and tobacco use are key factors that raise concern for this diagnosis. The reported light-headedness may be related to decreased blood flow to the brain due to the dissection. Immediate imaging  such as a CT scan  is required to confirm diagnosis. If confirmed  this is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate surgical intervention.  Plan: 1. Immediate CT angiography of chest and abdomen 2. Consult cardiothoracic surgery 3. Control blood pressure and heart rate with medications."

Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the last ten years  which is being managed with antihypertensive drugs. He also has a past medical history of smoking (1-pack a day for approximately 40 years) but quit five years ago. There is a family history of heart disease  specifically his father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 60.   Clinical Examination: On physical examination  the patient's blood pressure is markedly different in both arms  and he has a diastolic murmur heard best at the left parasternal area of his chest wall. His EKG showed no abnormalities.   In summary  the patient's advanced age  history of long-term hypertension  smoking history  and presenting symptoms strongly suggest aortic dissection. Further diagnostic tests  which may include a CT scan  are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and decide on treatment.   Other Considerations: Previous abdominal surgery or catheterization through the femoral artery might increase the risk of aortic dissection. The presence of other risk factors such as Marfan syndrome or other genetic disorders  atherosclerosis or cocaine use should also be taken into consideration. Any delay in the diagnosis and treatment of aortic dissection can lead to serious complications  including aortic rupture and death.

11,6,53,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial53,Problem Representation:  Demographics:   John  a 65-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency room with severe  acute chest pain. He works as an attorney and has stressful  long working hours. He lives with his wife  is a former smoker  and reports drinking socially. He has a BMI of 29  placing him in the overweight range.   Chief Complaint:  John complaints of a sudden onset of severe chest pain  describing it as ripping and tearing  radiating to his back. He states the pain started about three hours ago. The pain is unrelenting and is the most severe pain he has ever felt.  Past Medical History:  John has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for 15 years. He also has moderate atherosclerosis which was identified during a routine check-up around 5 years ago. He had a myocardial infarction two years back for which he received an angioplasty. Familiar history is positive for cardiovascular diseases. He has been inconsistent in taking his antihypertensive medications.  Functional History:  Until now  John has been able to continue his work and engage in mild physical activity  such as walking for half an hour daily. However  he does report increased fatigue over the past six months  which he attributed to his busy work schedule. He is independent in all of his daily activities.  Social History:  John quit smoking ten years ago. He reports drinking alcohol in moderate amounts during social gatherings. He has a high-stress job and his diet is significantly high in fat and sodium  partly due to frequent take-outs due to his busy schedule.  Medication History:  John is currently prescribed aspirin  a beta-blocker  a statin  and an ACE inhibitor  though he admits inconsistent adherence to these medications.  Problem Summary:  John's chief complaint  coupled with his history of poorly controlled hypertension  advanced age  history of atherosclerosis  and family history of cardiovascular diseases  raises a strong suspicion for aortic dissection  a potentially life-threatening condition. His history of a previous myocardial infarction suggests an underlying cardiovascular pathology that makes him at a high risk for an aortic dissection. His lifestyle factors  including a stressful job  poor diet  past smoking habit  also contribute to his risk. It is crucial to immediately address his symptom of severe chest pain. The negligence in taking his prescribed medications is another alarming concern that Jon has to address for better control of his conditions.

11,6,67,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial67,Patient Profile  Demographic Information: - Age: 65 years old - Sex: Male  - Race: Caucasian  - Occupation: Retired school teacher - Lifestyle: Sedentary  non-smoker  occasional drinker  mainly consumes a high sodium  high fat diet  Past Medical History: - Diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago and on antihypertensive medication  - Diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 10 years ago and on statin treatment - Had a mild stroke 5 years ago - Has a family history of cardiovascular diseases (father had a heart attack  brother has coronary artery disease) - Mild obesity (BMI 30) - Inconsistent compliance with prescribed medication and regular check-ups  Presenting Symptoms: - Acute severe tearing or ripping sharp pain in the upper back or chest area  particularly between the shoulder blades - Shortness of breath - Occasionally feels pulse abnormalities - Displays symptoms of shock (cold  sweaty skin; irregular heart rate; lightheadedness)  This problem representation characterizes a typical aortic dissection patient  with major risk factors present such as hypertension  hyperlipidemia  past history of stroke  family history of cardiovascular diseases  and inconsistency with medication that may lead to poorly controlled blood pressure. This patient's high sodium  high fat diet and sedentary lifestyle would also contribute to hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Although not all aortic dissection patients are male or elderly  men and those in their 60s and 70s are more at risk. Finally  the acute onset of severe chest pain is the most common symptom of aortic dissection.
11,6,68,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial68,Problem Representation:  Demographics:  A 65-year-old male with an ethnicity of African American has presented himself with symptoms consistent with aortic dissection.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension for which he has been taking medication (ACE inhibitors). The past medical records also indicate that he has been a heavy smoker for nearly 40 years  albeit he has quit smoking for a year now. Furthermore  there is also a familial history of aortic diseases  with the patient's father having suffered from an aortic dissection at the age of 70. For the past two years  the patient has also been diagnosed with high cholesterol levels and was prescribed statins  however  the patient has been noncompliant with the medication. The patient also suffers from obesity with a body mass index (BMI) over 30. Finally  the patient's record also shows a history of Marfan syndrome  a genetic disorder that often leads to aortic dissection.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient presents with severe  sudden chest pain radiating towards the back  shortness of breath  profuse sweating  clammy skin  and dizziness.  Thus  considering his ethnic background  age  sex  hypertension  smoking history  family history of aortic diseases  non-compliance with cholesterol-lowering treatment  obesity status  and Marfan syndrome  he is considered to be at a high risk for aortic dissection. His symptoms further supplement this suspicion. Immediate medical attention and exploration of the condition are thus warranted to confirm the diagnosis and initiate the most appropriate treatment with the urgency this condition demands.
11,6,69,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial69,Patient Profile:  Demographic Information: Patient is identified as a 68 year old  Caucasian male named John who works as a retired engineer and lives with his wife in Tampa  Florida. John is a non-smoker  does not consume alcohol  but has a history of high-fat diet consumption. He has Medicare insurance coverage.  Presenting Issue: John was brought to the emergency department with symptoms of severe chest pain described as ripping or tearing and moving to his back. He also has reported shortness of breath  asymmetrical pulse rate  sudden onset of intense  constant chest pain  sweating and nausea.  Past Medical History (PMH): John has a documented history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels from the past 20 years. His blood pressure has often been poorly controlled  with measurements above 140/90 mmHg on multiple occasions. In addition  he had a myocardial infarction approximately 8 years ago. He has been on medication for both conditions but not very regular in taking them. He also underwent a surgery for diverticulitis 4 years ago.   Family History: There is a family history of cardiovascular diseases  as John’s father suffered a stroke at the age of 60  and his mother died of a heart attack at the age of 70.  Current Medications: He is currently taking antihypertensive medications (Lisinopril  10mg/day)  and cholesterol management medications (Atorvastatin  20mg/day).  Recent Laboratory Results: His recent labs show elevated LDL cholesterol levels at 145mg/dL  HDL at 35mg/dL and total cholesterol at 225mg/dL.  Blood pressure reading taken in ER was 170/110 mmHg.   EKG: EKG revealed ST depressions and slight Q-waves  suggestive of ischemia or old damage  but no clear signs of an ongoing myocardial infarction.  User Tasks: 1. Further evaluate and manage John’s severe chest pain. 2. Conduct necessary diagnostic tests to confirm the aortic dissection and assess the extent of the condition. 3. Review and adjust John’s current medication management plan for his hypertension and cholesterol levels. 4. Implement lifestyle modifications to help control his cholesterol and blood pressure. 5. Provide counselling about the importance of medication adherence. 6. Assess risk factors and provide tailored intervention.
11,6,70,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial70,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a male  long-term heavy smoker  approximately 60 years old  is overweight with a BMI of 30  and has a history of poor control of hypertension. He also has a past medical history of high cholesterol levels and has been noncompliant with his antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medications.  Presenting Complaint and History of Present Illness: The patient presents with sudden  severe chest pain that began a few hours ago. The pain is described as tearing or ripping and is located in the anterior chest  radiating to the back. The intensity of pain is rapidly increasing. Accompanied by the pain  the patient has reported symptoms of shortness of breath and faintness.  Past Medical History: 1. Uncontrolled hypertension for the past 20 years 2. Hyperlipidemia  3. History of long-term tobacco use 4. Family history of vascular disorders (a brother diagnosed with an aneurysm at age 55). 5. Lack of regular physical activity 6. History of non-compliance with prescribed medication.  Social History: The Patient is a retired mechanic. He admits continuing heavy tobacco use  with a 40 pack-year smoking history. He lives with his wife and has a sedentary lifestyle. He admits to not usually visiting the doctor for routine check-ups and not taking regular medications.  Drug History: He was prescribed antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs but has been non adherent with these.   Given his age  long history of uncontrolled hypertension  smoking  and sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the back  aortic dissection is a prime differential diagnosis. The chest pain’s extreme severity  sometimes referred to as the worst pain a patient has experienced  is especially indicative of the possible aortic dissection in this case. Other possible causes might include myocardial infarction or a lung condition  given the patient's smoking history. However  these often present with different pain characteristics and accompanying symptoms.

11,6,76,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial76,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: A 69-year-old African American male.  Chief Complaint: The patient presents with sudden and severe chest pain.   History of Present Illness: The patient reports that the pain started suddenly while he was having dinner and has persisted for the last two hours. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping"""" in nature  with a severity of 8/10. The pain seemed to move down to his back and abdomen. He also complains of shortness of breath and mild nausea.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension for the last 15 years and mild atherosclerotic disease. He had been on oral antihypertensives but has been non-compliant with his medications over the past few months. The patient also has a history of smoking  consuming a half pack of cigarettes per day for around 40 years.  Family History: His father had an aortic aneurysm  which was surgically treated.  Social History: The patient is a retired engineer and lives with his wife. He consumes alcohol but in a moderate amount.  Review of System: No history of fever  cough  difficulty swallowing  hemoptysis  loss of consciousness  or weight loss.   Possible Diagnosis: The acute onset of severe chest pain with a history of long-standing hypertension raises suspicion for an aorta-related issue  specifically an aortic dissection. His symptoms  family history and risk factors like smoking and non-compliance with hypertension medications are consistent with this provisional diagnosis."
11,6,77,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial77,Problem Representation:  A 65-year-old African American male is presenting with sudden severe chest pain with a ripping/tearing quality  radiating to the back. He has a history of hypertension and a smoking habit of 20 years. He was non-compliant with his antihypertensive medication. He also has a family history of aortic dissection. His last visit to the office was two months ago where his blood pressure was 160/100 mmHg. He is tall with an above-average height and displays signs of Marfan syndrome  such as arachnodactyly  pectus excavatum  and features of hypermobility.  The patient display symptoms commonly associated with an aortic dissection - severe chest pain with a ripping/tearing quality  radiating to the back. Risk factors such as long history of hypertension  family history of aortic dissection  and a possible genetic disorder (Marfan syndrome)  which weakens aortic tissues  further increase his chances for aortic dissection. The smoking history compounds these risks as it can lead to further cardiovascular diseases. His non-compliance with antihypertensive therapy increases immediate risk for damage to blood vessels due to uncontrolled high blood pressure.  The primary suspicion is an aortic dissection  necessitating urgent diagnostic confirmation such as a CT angiogram or transesophageal echocardiography  and prompt surgical or medical management. The patient's presentation could be representative of a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate interventions to prevent potential lethal outcomes such as rupture  malperfusion syndromes  or cardiac tamponade. His long-term management would also need to focus on blood pressure control and smoking cessation.

11,6,79,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial79,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  A 60-year-old African-American male presented to the emergency department.  Chief Complaint:  Sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the back.  History of Present Illness: The patient described the pain as a sharp  tearing sensation  starting in the front and moving towards the back. The chest pain was accompanied by shortness of breath. He reported that the symptoms emerged suddenly while he was resting at home.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a known history of untreated hypertension for over 15 years  a smoking habit of 30 pack-years  a history of high cholesterol levels  prior myocardial infarction five years ago  and a family history of aortic dissection in his mother and a brother.  Social History:  The patient is a smoker  with a 30 pack-year history. He consumes alcohol occasionally but denies recreational drug use. He lives alone and is currently unemployed due to his deteriorating health.  Review of Systems:  Positive for chest pain  shortness of breath  and nausea. Negative for fever  cough  abdominal pain  vomiting  and changes in bowel or bladder habits.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  vital signs showed blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg in the right arm and 130/85 mmHg in the left arm  pulse 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. Heart sounds were normal. There was tenderness over the chest wall. Lung sounds were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Lab Investigations: Awaiting results.  Based on the above information  the most probable diagnosis is aortic dissection. The patient's untreated hypertension  the smoking habit  the family history of aortic dissection  and the sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back all points towards an aortic dissection.  Planned actions include stabilizing the patient  pain management  controlling hypertension  and preparing for surgical intervention as aortic dissection is a medical emergency. The definitive diagnosis will depend on imaging studies like CT angiography or Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA).

He has struggled with medication compliance due to side effect of fatigue and tight financial constraints following his retirement. His last recorded blood pressure  about three months ago  was 170/100 mmHg  higher than the recommended level  despite being on a thiazide diuretic and a beta-blocker.  Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) The patient was diagnosed with CAD ten years ago  following a partial blockage in one of the coronary arteries. He underwent angioplasty and was put on an aspirin. Since then  he has not experienced any angina complaints.  Hypercholesterolemia The patient has a long record of high cholesterol levels  not adequately controlled by diet and lifestyle modifications. He is on a statin treatment for this.  Tobacco and Alcohol Use The patient has a 40-year history of smoking about a pack of cigarettes per day but quit five years ago following his CAD diagnosis. He also reports moderate alcohol intake of approximately two drinks per day.  Family History The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father suffered from a myocardial infarction at 72  and his elder brother had a stroke at 65.  Recent Complaints The patient came in reporting sudden severe chest pain that started about an hour ago—describing it as a """"ripping"""" pain that started in his chest and radiated to his back. He also commented about accompanying shortness of breath  dizziness and a feeling of impending doom.  This complete patient representation inclusive of demographic and medical history is consistent with individuals at risk or presenting with aortic dissection. Special attention needs to be given due to the immediate life-threatening nature of the condition. Immediate diagnostic procedures should be carried out to confirm  and prompt medical surgical intervention may be needed."
11,6,82,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial82,Patient Profile:  Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 63 years old  Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired Engineer Smoking History: 40 pack-years  Description:  John  a retired engineer  is a 63-years-old white male who is suffering from severe chest pain that radiates to his back. The sudden and severe onset of the chest pain is similar to tearing or ripping  which intensified over time. He also reported a loss of consciousness and shortness of breath. He has a history of hypertension that has been uncontrolled for the past few years. The patient is a heavy smoker with approximately 40 pack-years of tobacco use. His father passed away from a heart attack at the age of 65  and his elder brother had an aortic aneurysm at the age of 60.   Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Patient has been dealing with high blood pressure for the past 20 years which has been relatively uncontrolled in the recent years despite being on antihypertensive medication.  2. Hypercholesterolemia: John has also been diagnosed with high cholesterol levels for which he is on statin therapy.  3. Smoking History: John has a heavy smoking history with about 40 pack-years.  4. Family History: Significant for cardiovascular disease  as his father had a fatal heart attack at 65 and his elder brother had an aortic aneurysm at 60.  5. No history of diabetes  but has been identified as being pre-diabetic.  6. No known drug allergies.  Given his clinical presentation and medical history  aortic dissection is being heavily considered and immediate diagnostic procedures are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and appropriate treatment given the life-threatening nature of the condition. Further  his uncontrolled hypertension and heavy smoking history are significant risk factors for his condition. The presence of the condition in his brother is another significant point to consider in the diagnosis. His hypercholesterolemia and increased age might have contributed to his vascular disease. The absence of a history of diabetes mellitus  however  is a positive aspect in his case but his pre-diabetic state needs to be managed efficiently to prevent further complications.
11,6,83,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial83,"Patient Profile: Name: John Doe Age: 65 Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired  Presenting Problem:  John Doe presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden severe chest pain that started an hour ago. Pain being described as """"tearing"""" travelling from the chest towards the back.   Past Medical History: - Hypertension diagnosed 7 years ago  on medication but has inconsistent compliance due to side effects. - 35 pack-year history of smoking  quit 2 years ago. - Treated for high cholesterol  currently controlled with statins. - No known drug allergies.  Family History: - Father died at 70 due to heart attack.  - Mother died at 82 due to stroke  had history of hypertension.  Social History: - Does not consume alcohol. - Former smoker (quit 2 years ago). - Lives with wife  who is his primary caregiver.  Physical Examination: - Vital signs unstable. Blood pressure unusually high and there is a notable difference between the readings from both arms.  - Sweating profusely and appears anxious.  Working Diagnosis:  Based on the presenting symptoms  past medical history  age  sex  and the results of the preliminary physical examination  the patient is suspected of having an aortic dissection. This will need to be confirmed with further diagnostic testing  including CT angiography.   The risk factors in this case are the patient's history of hypertension and smoking  as well as the family history of cardiovascular disease. Given the nature of aortic dissection and the high level of risk it poses  the patient needs to be managed in a setting with access to emergency cardiovascular surgery.   The high blood pressure reading suggests that despite being on medication for hypertension  his blood pressure has not been properly controlled  which might have contributed to the development of an aortic dissection. It's also notable that the patient's compliance with antihypertensive medication has been variable due to side effects  which suggests the need for a medication review and potentially the introduction of a different antihypertensive medication.   Being a former smoker does not erase all the risk for cardiovascular diseases immediately  which is likely contributing to his current condition.   Further diagnostic testing and management will be required for this patient.   Treatment Plan:  John will require immediate lowering of blood pressure to prevent further tearing. He will also need a referral to cardiovascular surgery if the dissection involves the ascending aorta."
11,6,84,diagnosis11-prompt6-trial84,"Patient Problem Representation:  Mr. Thompson is a 63-year-old Caucasian male presenting at the emergency department complaining of sudden severe chest pain that radiates to his back  difficulty breathing  and feeling weak all over. He describes the chest pain as """"tearing"""" and """"ripping"""" in nature.  He has a significant past medical history including poorly controlled hypertension  history of heavy smoking  and a diagnosis of Marfan Syndrome  a genetic disorder that weakens connective tissues including those in the heart. He further disclosed a family history of aortic dissection which led to his mother's sudden death when she was 59.  His heart rate is racing at 105 beats/min and his blood pressure measures 180/100 mmHg  higher than the range of normal values. When examining the heart  the doctor hears a heart murmur indicative of aortic insufficiency  one of the complications of aortic dissection.   In this case  his past medical history  clinical symptoms  family history  and physical examination findings strongly suggest Mr. Thompson is suffering from an aortic dissection — a serious  life-threatening condition where the inner layer of the aorta tears  causing the inner and middle layers to dissect or separate. His uncontrolled hypertension is likely a significant contributing factor  and his Marfan Syndrome increases his risk of aortic disease. Therefore  this condition needs prompt diagnosis and treatment."

Occupation: Office Worker  Clinical Presentation:  Primary Complaint: Sudden severe chest pain described as tearing  sharp  or stabbing in nature that has spread to the back.  Past Medical History:  1. Hypertension: Patient has been suffering from uncontrolled blood pressure despite being under medication. 2. Atherosclerosis: The patient was diagnosed 5 years ago with substantial arterial plaque build-up. 3. Marfan Syndrome: Genetic tests reveal that the patient carries this genetic disorder which is known to affect connective tissue  and often associated to aortic dissections. 4. Smoking: The patient has a 30-pack-year smoking history and only quit recently. 5. Previous Cardiac Surgery: Patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft operation about two years ago. 6. Familial History: Father died suddenly from aortic rupture at the age of 55 years old.  Social History:  1. Alcohol: Moderate Alcohol consumption. 2. Physical Activity: Sedentary lifestyle with no regular exercise. 3. Diet: High in saturated fats and cholesterol.  The above information represents a typical patient with a potential aortic dissection. His uncontrolled hypertension  atherosclerosis  Marfan Syndrome  smoking  lack of physical activity  a diet high in unhealthy elements and a family history of aortic problems could all contribute to his current acute health crisis. The sudden  severe chest pain radiating to his back could signify aortic dissection.

11,7,1,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial1,Title: Thoracic Aortic Dissection in an Elderly Female Patient: A Case Report  I. Patient Information The subject of this case report is a 79-year-old Asian woman  married  non-smoker  and with no history of alcohol or substance abuse. She is retired and lives in an urban residence with her husband of 55 years. She is a mother of four with a family history of hypertension.  II. Clinical Findings and Past Medical History The patient reported severe  sudden onset chest pain radiating to the back  typical of aortic dissection. A tearing sensation was described  which began while she was performing household chores. In the past  she was diagnosed with systemic hypertension for which she was on Metoprolol and Amlodipine. Her blood pressure was managed and recorded to be in a fair range in her regular hospital visits. She also has a history of post-menopausal osteoporosis  for which she received regular treatment. There was a record of periodic complaints of heart palpitations over the last 2 years.  III. Diagnostic Assessment A physical examination revealed a blood pressure disparity between the two arms with high heart rate. A chest radiograph showed mediastinal widening. Immediate computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed a Stanford Type A dissection starting at the ascending aorta through the length of the descending aorta. Echocardiography supported the findings and reported a mild aortic valve insufficiency. Laboratory investigations showed normal renal function  no signs of anemia  normal cholesterol and lipid profiles  and positive Cardiac Troponin-I (ctnI).  IV. Therapeutic Intervention Due to the emergent nature of the disorder and risk factors involved  the patient was immediately scheduled for surgery. An open surgical repair involving aortic root  ascending aorta  and hemiarch replacement along with aortic valve resuspension was conducted successfully. Post-operatively  the patient was maintained on inotropic support and ventilator. Prophylactic antibiotics were performed to avoid the risk of post-operative infection.  V. Follow-Up and Outcome The patient remained stable with a noticeable improvement in her general condition  and was discharged after two weeks with antihypertensive medications (Losartan and Metoprolol). She was advised to follow a low-salt diet  to avoid heavy exertion  and to continue her osteoporosis treatment. Her prognosis was favorable with plans for close medical supervision in light of her advanced age and the severity of the aortic dissection.  VI. Patient Perspective The patient reported experiencing significant fear during the initial onset of symptoms but expressed gratitude for the urgent and efficient medical response.  She committed to follow her prescribed treatment regimen and lifestyle changes necessary for her recovery.  VII. Informed Consent Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case study. The patient understood the purpose and requirement and voluntarily gave her permission.  This clinical case highlights the need for immediate diagnosis and treatment of aortic dissection  especially in patients with a history of hypertension. Clinicians should also consider the presence of underlying conditions like osteoporosis which may pose additional risks when planning for the treatment. 
11,7,2,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial2,"Patient Details:  Mr. X  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with sudden onset and severe chest pain radiating to back.  Presenting Complaints: The pain was described as """"tearing"""" in nature  rating a 10 out of 10 in severity. The patient also reported shortness of breath  and episodes of dizziness.  Past Medical History: The patient had a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the last 20 years. He was supposed to take metoprolol and lisinopril  but was non-compliant with the medication regimen. Mr. X is also a chronic smoker for the last 40 years and has a moderate alcohol intake but denied illicit drug use. The patient's father had passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 75.  Physical Exam: On arrival  Mr. X appeared visibly distressed and diaphoretic. Vital signs showed a blood pressure of 190/100 mmHg in the right arm and 170/95 mmHg in the left arm  pulse of 110 beats per minute  normal sinus rhythm  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rhythm with a harsh systolic murmur at aortic area. The remaining physical exam was unremarkable.  Investigations: A 12-lead ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy but no acute changes suggestive of myocardial infarction. Chest X-ray revealed mediastinal widening and aortic contour abnormality. Subsequently  a CT angiogram of the thoracic aorta was performed  confirming the diagnosis of Type A aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta and extending to the aortic arch.  Treatment and Outcome: Immediate surgical consultation was arranged. The patient underwent successful emergency ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement with a graft under hypothermic circulatory arrest. Post-operative course was complicated by temporary acute kidney injury which resolved over time. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 14 on lifelong antihypertensive agents with regular follow-ups scheduled with the cardiac surgery  cardiology  and primary care team.  The importance of medication compliance was lectured to the patient and his family by the discharge team. Mr. X gave up smoking and decreased his alcohol intake following the serious event.  Conclusion: This case report highlights the life-threatening nature of aortic dissection  an important differential diagnosis for acute chest pain. The risk factors predominantly include long-term uncontrolled hypertension and a history of smoking  as seen with Mr. X. This emphasizes the need for good blood pressure control and education regarding lifestyle modifications to patients."
11,7,3,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial3,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 54-Year-Old Caucasian Male: A Case Report  Abstract: This case report describes a 54-year-old Caucasian male who presented with a sudden onset of severe chest pain and was ultimately diagnosed with an acute aortic dissection. This case underscores the importance of a high index of suspicion in patients presenting with severe chest pain and highlights some of the significant potential complications that can arise if the diagnosis is delayed.  Introduction: Aortic dissection is a critical condition that requires immediate diagnosis and treatment. It is often overlooked due to varied and non-specific presenting symptoms  leading to high mortality and morbidity rates if not promptly diagnosed and managed.  Case Presentation:  Mr. M  a 54-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department complaining of a sudden  severe chest pain that radiated to his back. He described the pain as tearing. The patient had a history of hypertension  a significant smoking habit of 30 pack-years  and a family history of cardiovascular disease  with his father suffering his first myocardial infarction at the age of 52.  Upon examination  the patient was found to be pale and sweaty. His blood pressure was significantly low with a reading of 90/60 mmHg  and his pulse was 110 beats per minute. The physical examination was unremarkable except for a discrepancy in the blood pressure readings between his two arms. An electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes but was negative for signs of myocardial infarction.   Given his symptoms and physical findings  the emergency care team considered aortic dissection amongst their differential diagnoses. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was urgently performed and revealed a Stanford type A aortic dissection commencing from the ascending aorta extending into the descending aorta.  The patient was promptly transferred to a cardiothoracic center  where emergent surgical intervention  including ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement  was performed. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for post-operative care. Following a steady period of recovery and rehabilitation  Mr. M was discharged home with instructions for strict blood pressure control  smoking cessation  and genetic counseling.  Conclusion: Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate diagnosis and treatment.

11,7,4,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial4,Title: A Rare Case of Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection in a 60-Year-Old Male with a History of Hypertension  Abstract: This case report discusses a rare diagnostic case of Stanford Type A aortic dissection  emphasizing the necessity for a high index of clinical suspicion in patients with severe chest pain and predisposing factors. The patient has suffered from uncontrolled hypertension  which is a major risk factor for aortic dissection.  Case Presentation:  A 60-year-old Caucasian male  non-smoker  employed as an auditor  presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of sudden-onset  sharp  severe chest pain radiating to the back. Apart from uncontrolled hypertension for 15 years  his past medical history was unremarkable  with no known allergies  no family history of similar complaints or cardiovascular diseases  no previous surgeries  and no long-term medications except antihypertensive drugs.  Clinical Findings: On initial examination  the patient was anxious  pale  and diaphoretic. His blood pressure was noted to be markedly different in both arms - 190/95 mmHg in the right upper limb and 150/80 mmHg in the left. He had a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute and respirations at 22 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular examination revealed a murmur at the right upper sternal border. Auscultation of the lungs showed no abnormalities.  Diagnostic Assessment: An immediate electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left ventricular hypertrophy with strain pattern  but without signs of acute ischemia. Emergency bedside echocardiography showed dilated aortic root with an intimal flap  suggesting the possibility of an aortic dissection. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of the thorax confirmed the diagnosis of Stanford Type A aortic dissection extending from the aortic root to the arch with partial true and false lumen expansion. His laboratory workup revealed mildly elevated D-dimer and cardiac troponin levels.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers and nitroprusside to control his blood pressure and pulse rate  following which he underwent emergency ascending aortic replacement and aortic valve repair surgery.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: Post-operative recovery was uneventful  with improved blood pressure control. The patient was discharged on the 10th postoperative day with advice for strict blood pressure control and follow-up echocardiography after 1 month. At the follow-up visit  transthoracic echocardiography revealed no pericardial effusion  normal left ventricular function  and the prosthetic aortic graft was patent with no signs of leakage.  Conclusion:  This case reveals the essential need for maintaining a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients with uncontrolled hypertension presenting with severe chest pain. Rapid diagnosis with timely surgical intervention can significantly improve prognosis in such life-threatening scenarios.

He has a known history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and is a 20-pack-year tobacco user. The patient lives in an urban setting and is employed in a high-stress professional occupation. He has a family history of heart disease  with his father having had a myocardial infarction at the age of 62 and his older brother a stroke at 54.  Clinical Findings: The patient described the pain as ‘tearing’ in nature  rated it as 10/10 severity  which radiated to his back. He was pale  diaphoretic  experiencing shortness of breath  and had noticeable difficulty speaking between breaths. His blood pressure on presentation was 180/90 mmHg in the right arm  and 160/80 mmHg in the left arm. He was tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 bpm. His oxygen saturation was slightly compromised at 91%.  Diagnostic Assessment: Post initial examination  the patient was immediately sent for further diagnostic tests including electrocardiogram (ECG)  chest X-ray  serum troponin  and D-Dimer levels  all of which were inconclusive. However  due to the severity of the chest pain and the difference in blood pressure readings between the arms  he was referred for an urgent computed tomography angiogram (CTA) which confirmed the diagnosis of ascending aortic dissection (Stanford type A).  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was immediately administered intravenous beta-blockers and nitroprusside to lower blood pressure and blunt the cardiac impulse. He was subsequently transferred to cardiovascular surgery and underwent successful emergency aortic root and ascending aorta replacement surgery with a Dacron graft.   Follow Up and Outcome: Post-surgical recovery was uneventful. The patient was monitored in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for 3 days and later transferred to the step-down unit. He was discharged after 10 days with antihypertensive medication and instructions for strict blood pressure control  cessation of smoking  dietary modifications  and comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program.  Patient Perspective: Mr. AB expressed gratitude for the swift diagnosis and therapeutic decisions made by the medical team. He is committed to making the recommended lifestyle changes and intended to follow-up regularly with his cardiologist.

Past Medical History: Mr. A has been treated for hypertension for the past 15 years  poorly controlled. He is also a daily smoker with a 40-pack year smoking history. He does not have diabetes  and there is no known family history of heart disease.  Investigations:   Vitals at admission were heart rate 102 bpm  blood pressure 152/96 mmHg. Physical examination revealed diaphoresis and a systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border. An ECG was performed showing no signs of Myocardial Infarction (MI).  A CT angiogram confirmed a diagnosis of aortic dissection  beginning just above the level of the aortic valve and extending into the lower abdominal aorta. The true lumen was compressed and there was partial false lumen thrombosis observed.  Therapeutic Intervention:   Initially  the patient was managed with esmolol to control the ventricular response  and nitroprusside to control the blood pressure. Surgical consultation was taken immediately.  As he was relatively stable hemodynamically  he underwent Bentall operation (a surgery that involves the replacement of the aortic valve  aortic root  and ascending aorta with re-implantation of the coronary artery into the graft procedure) successfully. The postoperative course was uneventful.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  At the six-month follow-up appointment  the patient was found to be doing well. His blood pressure control improved significantly on medications with a current reading of 134/84 mmHg. A repeat CT angiogram was done which showed no evidence of dissection and a patent graft.  Patient Perspective:  Mr. A quit smoking and made lifestyle modifications including a balanced diet and regular exercise. He reported being grateful for surviving the surgical procedure and mentioned that the experience made him value his health and life more.  Conclusions:  Uncontrolled Hypertension  heavy physical activity  and smoking were the major contributors to the aortic dissection in this case. This case emphasizes the importance of preventative measures and early diagnosis to prevent the mortality associated with aortic dissections. It reinforces the significance of chest pain which should never be ignored and always be properly investigated. This early detection and immediate surgical intervention saved this patient's life.

11,7,15,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial15,"Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 68-year-old male: A Case Report  Introduction:  Aortic dissection represents one of the most severe cardiovascular emergencies which involves a tear in the inner layer of the aorta  allowing blood to surge through the tear  causing the inner and middle layers of the aorta to separate (dissect).  Patient Information:  The subject is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  current smoker  with an underlying history of uncontrolled hypertension  previously diagnosed with moderate atherosclerosis. There were no known allergies or drug intolerances. He was retired and lived with his wife. His family history revealed his father had died from an aortic aneurysm. He had no significant surgical history and he was not experiencing any other health issues prior to his admission at the hospital.  Clinical Findings:  The patient arrived at the hospital complaining of sudden onset severe chest and back pain  described as """"tearing"""" in nature. He also reported transient loss of consciousness  profuse perspiration and acute distress. His blood pressure was significantly different between both arms (right arm: 200/110 mmHg  left arm: 150/90 mmHg)  a clinical sign suggestive of aortic dissection. He was also found to have a faint diastolic murmur heard over the right second intercostal space.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An immediate electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed no acute ischemic changes. However  chest x-ray demonstrated mediastinal widening. Subsequently  the patient underwent a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) which revealed aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the iliac arteries  Stanford type A.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Due to the Stanford type A classification and the patient's deteriorating hemodynamic status  emergent surgical intervention was deemed necessary. Following a sternotomy  an artificial graft was placed  and the dissected section of the aorta was resected. His postoperative course was uneventful  and the patient was discharged after 14 days in stable condition on antihypertensive medication.  Follow-Up and Outcome:  The patient had follow-up appointments at one month  three months and six months. He showed satisfactory recovery with no post-operative complications. Repeated imaging revealed stable prosthetic grafts with no evidence of further dissection or leakage.  Discussion:  This case exemplifies that aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that demands prompt diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention. It highlights the importance of recognizing key clinical features suggestive of aortic dissection  particularly severe chest or abdominal pain with a sudden onset  varying blood pressure between the two arms  and enlarged mediastinum on a chest radiograph.  Informed Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.  Lessons Learned:  Given the high mortality rate associated with aortic dissection  early recognition and apt intervention are pivotal. Detailed medical history and quick  accurate assessment can accelerate life-saving interventions.

11,7,17,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial17,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 65-Year-Old Male with a History of Hypertension: A Case Report  Introduction: This case involved a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of sudden onset  severe chest pain radiating to the back. The patient lived in rural Utah  and was a retired engineer with a significant  long-standing history of uncontrolled hypertension. He was a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. There was no known family history of cardiovascular disease.   Case Presentation: The patient was alert and oriented upon arrival but exhibited signs of distress. Physical examination showed a blood pressure discrepancy between right and left upper limbs: 150/90 mmHg versus 135/80 mmHg  respectively. Heart rate was 110 beats per minute  respiration rate was 20 per minute  and he had a body temperature of 37.5-degree Celsius (~99.5 F).  He appeared to be in significant pain characterized as 'tearing' in nature  originating in the chest and radiating to the back. The ECG showed non-specific ST and T wave changes.  Medical History: The patient had a medical history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 15 years  treated with generic lisinopril 10 mg daily. Compliance with the medication was established albeit poor hypertension control. The patient had no known drug allergies.  Investigations and Diagnosis: In light of the presentation and history  the initial clinical suspicion was of aortic dissection. This was confirmed by a contrast-enhanced CT scan that demonstrated a Stanford type B aortic dissection starting just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending to the level of the renal arteries. There was no evidence of rupture  and other organs appeared uninvolved.  Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aggressive antihypertensive therapy with intravenous labetalol  aiming to reach a systolic blood pressure of <120 mmHg and a heart rate of <60 bpm to reduce shear stress on the aortic wall. On achieving hemodynamic stability  he was considered for thoracic endovascular aortic repair. A successful surgery took place 24 hours after the diagnosis.  Follow-up: The patient's recovery was uneventful. He was discharged after one week on oral antihypertensive therapy (amlodipine and metoprolol). He has been regularly monitored and no adverse events have been noted during his 6-month follow-up period. His hypertension control has significantly improved.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of timely diagnosis and management of aortic dissection  especially in patients with a history of hypertension. Regular monitoring and proper blood pressure control can significantly reduce the risk of this grave condition.

She has no reported allergies and does not have a history of substance abuse. There is no relevant family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Presenting Complaint:  Mrs. X presented to the emergency department in severe distress. She described experiencing a sudden onset of severe chest pain  radiating to her back  2 hours prior to her arrival. The pain was described as a 'ripping' or 'tearing' sensation.  Tests and Diagnostic Assessment:  On physical examination  her blood pressure showed significant variation between the right (180/100 mmHg) and the left arm (155/85 mmHg). A grade 3/6 diastolic murmur was noted. The initial ECG did not show any myocardial infarction.  Considering her symptoms  elevated blood pressure  and asymmetric pulses  a clinical suspicion of acute aortic dissection was made. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis  revealing a type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the abdominal aorta  just above the renal arteries.  Management and Follow-Up:  Mrs. X was immediately referred to cardiothoracic surgery. Emergency surgical intervention  consisting of replacing the ascending aorta and aortic root with a graft  was undertaken.  Postoperative recovery was complicated by transient acute kidney injury and postoperative atrial fibrillation. However  these issues were resolved with the appropriate medical therapy.  Over a five-day period in the ICU  her blood pressure and heart rate were controlled strictly with intravenous labetalol and nitroprusside. Eventually  oral beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were initiated. Mrs. X was shifted to the ward on postoperative day 8 and was discharged in a stable condition after 2 weeks.  Two-month and six-month follow-up visits were scheduled. At last follow-up  she was doing well without recurrence of chest or back pain. The follow-up CT angiogram showed no evidence of progression of dissection and her hypertension was well controlled.

Introduction  Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition where the inner layer of the aorta tears  causing blood to surge through the tear creating a new false lumen between the intimal and medial layers of the aorta. Although a rare condition  it is critical for prompt diagnosis and timely intervention.  II. Clinical Presentation   A 48-year-old Caucasian male presented to Emergency Department (ED) with a sudden severe chest pain that he described as """"tearing"""" in nature  radiating to his back. The pain awakened him from sleep. The patient had no prior history of similar type of chest pain. His past medical history was significant for untreated hypertension  a 30-pack year smoking history and a recent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His family history was significant for cardiovascular disease  with his father passing away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 55. He lived a sedentary lifestyle and was working as a software engineer. He had no history of illicit drug use. He was a social drinker and a current active smoker of 1 pack per day.  III. Examination and Investigation   Upon initial examination  his blood pressure was high (200/120 mmHg) with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute. His electrocardiogram (EKG) showed no signs of ischemia or infarction. Physical examination was notable for diminished peripheral pulses and mild diaphoresis  with equal bilateral breath sounds reported.  Further in our workup  a CT scan was ordered revealing an ascending aortic dissection extending from the root of the aorta proximally and progressing distally down its entire length. The diagnosis of Stanford Type A aortic dissection was subsequently established.  IV. Management and Outcome  The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta blockers and nitroprusside to control his blood pressure and heart rate. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and they decided to perform an emergency surgical repair. Post-operatively  the patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit (CCU) for recovery. Despite surgical complications including prolonged mechanical ventilation and renal failure requiring temporary hemodialysis  the patient made a slow but steady recovery  and was discharged to a rehab facility after a 3-week hospital stay.  V. Discussion   Aortic dissection is a critical disease that requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Early recognition supplemented by prompt CT imaging  tight blood pressure and heart rate control  and immediate surgical intervention improve patient outcomes. This case illustrates the importance of suspecting aortic dissection in patients  especially in those with risk factors such as uncontrolled hypertension  smoking and a family history of cardiovascular diseases.

Clinical Presentation: The patient presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset severe chest pain that radiated to the back  specifically between the shoulder blades. The patient described it as """"tearing"""" or """"ripping"""" in character. He had been experiencing hypertension for both systolic and diastolic readings for the past 10 years which was managed mainly with Lisinopril and lifestyle modifications. He also admitted to a 40-year history of smoking  though he quit ten years ago.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  the patient was found to be in acute distress  displaying diaphoresis and anxiety. Blood pressure readings were higher in the right arm compared to the left  a difference of 30mmHg. Heart rate was regular but tachycardic at 110 bpm. The patient’s pulmonary exam indicated clear lung fields with no abnormal heart sounds.  Investigations: Immediate bedside transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed an intimal flap in the ascending aorta  a finding indicative of aortic dissection. Further imaging by CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis with the visualization of a type A aortic dissection beginning just above the aortic valve and extending to the proximal sections of the aorta. Laboratory results revealed a slightly elevated D-Dimer  White blood cell count (WBC)  and Troponin.  Treatment: The patient was immediately started on intravenous Beta-blockers (Esmolol) for controlling heart rate and blood pressure. Emergent surgical consultation for aortic repair was called. After a successful surgical repair of type A aortic dissection with a Dacron graft  the patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring.  Outcome and Follow-Up: The patient's postoperative recovery was steady  with a notable alleviation of his initial symptoms. He was discharged on post-operative day 10 and recommended to follow-up at the outpatient clinic. He was counseled on the importance of adhering to his antihypertensive medications and encouraged to maintain lifestyle adjustments including a low-sodium diet  regular exercise  and no smoking.  Conclusion:  This case demonstrates that aortic dissection  although rare  should be considered as a differential diagnosis in hypertensive patients presenting with sudden severe chest or back pain. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention play key roles in the successful management and survival of the patient."

The patient described the pain as sudden and unlike anything experienced before. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia managed with lifestyle modification and medications but had been non-compliant with her medication regimen in the past several months. She is also a past smoker with approximately 20 pack-year smoking history  stopped 15 years ago. She has no known genetic disorders or family history of aortic diseases.   Clinical Findings: On examination  she was diaphoretic and appeared distressed. Her initial blood pressure was 190/85 mmHg in the right upper extremity and 180/80 mmHg in the left upper extremity. Heart rate was 100 beats/minute  and laboratory results showed slightly elevated cardiac markers. No signs of neurological deficits or pulses differences were noted. She had a normal cardiac auscultation without any diastolic murmur.   Diagnostic Assessment: The electrocardiogram (ECG) conducted showed no signs of acute ischemia but did reveal left ventricular hypertrophy which could be attributed to long-standing hypertension. Emergency contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed an aortic dissection starting just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending down to the iliac bifurcation  consistent with a Stanford Type B aortic dissection.   Therapeutic Intervention / Management: Due to the patient’s significant hypertension and the type of aortic dissection  she was treated medically. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and management of her blood pressure. Intravenous beta-blockers were initiated to achieve a target heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute  and vasodilators were utilized to maintain systolic blood pressure below 120 mmHg.   Follow-up and Outcomes: Her chest pain progressively improved  and repeat imaging on hospital day three showed no progression of the dissection. She tolerated the treatment well and was discharged on oral antihypertensive medication with strict advice on medication compliance and lifestyle modifications  in addition to close outpatient follow-ups. Her follow-ups and repeat imaging at one and six months showed stable aortic dissection.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed gratitude for the care she received and has been compliant with all follow-up appointments and medications. She has also made significant lifestyle changes to control her hypertension and overall health.  Take-Away: This case highlights the importance of immediate recognition and management of aortic dissection  particularly in older patients presenting with acute  severe  atypical chest or back pain.

Patient Information:  The patient is a heavy smoker with a 40 pack-year history. His background includes uncontrolled hypertension  high cholesterol levels  and a past history of intravenous drug use  mainly cocaine. He has no known allergies. Family history reveals three close relatives who have suffered from cardiovascular diseases  including his father who had an aortic dissection at 65. The patient works as a car mechanic and his physical activity levels are moderately low.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  there was a significant blood pressure difference between the patient's right and left arms (a difference of 20 mmHg)  and an early diastolic murmur was noted. The patient showed signs of impaired consciousness and mild confusional state suggesting possible cerebral hypoperfusion. An EKG was performed which did not show signs of myocardial infarction.  Timeline:  The onset of intense  tearing chest pain started two hours before his admission. In the emergency department  a computed tomography (CT) angiogram was organized  which confirmed the diagnosis of Stanford Type A aortic dissection with an involvement of ascending aorta and aortic arch  extending into the descending aorta.  Diagnostic Assessment:  The definitive diagnosis was made through a CT angiogram which revealed an intimal flap in the ascending aorta  the hallmark sign of aortic dissection. Some laboratory findings were indicative of renal insufficiency with a serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl (normal range: 0.6-1.2 mg/dl). Other blood tests including complete blood count  liver enzymes and electrolytes were within normal limits.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to lower his blood pressure and heart rate. Emergency surgical repair was planned  and the patient was transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery team. An emergency repair  including replacement of the ascending aorta and resuspension of the aortic valve  was done using cardiopulmonary bypass.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  Post-operatively  the patient showed significant improvement. His postoperative echocardiogram confirmed the successful repair of the aortic dissection and he was discharged 10 days later for home self-care and follow-up in the cardiology clinic. His vital signs at discharge were stable  and his pain was well managed on oral analgesics. The patient was also started on life-long antihypertensive therapy.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the role of a timely diagnosis in ensuring a good outcome in cases of aortic dissection. Detailed history and physical examination guided further intervention and led to the successful management of this condition.

11,7,37,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial37,Title: A Case Report on Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection in a 68-Year-Old Man  Case Description:  A 68-year-old Caucasian male  with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia  presented to our emergency department (ED) complaining of a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his back  along with mild difficulty in breathing.  Past medical history of the patient included 15 years of uncontrolled hypertension for which he was not taking prescribed medication regularly and 10 years of dyslipidemia controlled with medication. His father had a history of suffering from a stroke  but no similar vascular complications were reported in the extended family. The patient had a history of 30-pack-years of smoking but quit 10 years ago.   The patient was overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 29  indicating a history of poor dietary habits and a sedentary lifestyle. He reported no known allergies. On the day of the event  his blood pressure in the right arm was 160/110 mmHg  while blood pressure measurements could not be obtained from the left arm.   Upon examination  the patient appeared diaphoretic and in distress. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was immediately performed revealing non-specific ST-T wave changes but no definite evidence of an acute ischemic event. Due to the discrepancy in arm blood pressure measurements and the nature of the symptoms  an immediate computed tomography (CT) angiogram was acquired which confirmed the diagnosis of an acute Stanford Type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the abdominal aorta just above the aortic bifurcation.   The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to control his high blood pressure and to prevent further propagation of the dissection. The patient was rushed to the operating room for an urgent surgical intervention which included an ascending aortic replacement with a Dacron graft and aortic valve resuspension.   Post-operatively  the patient was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring. His postoperative course was complicated by transient renal insufficiency and ischemic hepatitis (shock liver) presumably secondary to a period of hypotension intraoperatively.   Over the subsequent days  his renal function and liver enzymes trended towards normalization and he was transferred from the ICU to the general floor on postoperative day 7. On postoperative day 10  the patient was discharged to home with referrals for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation and ongoing monitoring and follow-up with a cardiovascular surgeon.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of rapid diagnosis and intervention for aortic dissection in hypertensive individuals. It also highlights the role of vigilant and sustained management of risk factors like hypertension  dyslipidemia  obesity  and smoking cessation in preventing serious cardiovascular events.

There was no associated shortness of breath  cough  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  palpitation  syncope  or orthopnea.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a twenty-year history of hypertension and is on Amlodipine 10mg daily and Losartan 100mg daily. She is also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia for which she is on Atorvastatin 20mg at night. She has smoked a half pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years but quit five years ago. She has no history of surgery or allergies.  Physical Examination:  On examination  her temperature was 37C  heart rate 110 beats/min  blood pressure 150/90mmHg at the right arm  and 130/80mmHg in the left arm  respiratory rate 22 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed a grade II/VI early diastolic murmur heard best at the second right intercostal space. Pulmonary  abdominal  and neurologic exams were normal.   Investigation Findings:  Lab tests showed elevated D-dimer levels. Her ECG showed signs of left ventricular hypertrophy but no acute ischemic changes. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection. It started just after the aortic arch and extended to the level of the renal arteries.   Management:  She was emergently transferred to the Cardiothoracic department for surgical management where she underwent successful valve-sparing aortic root replacement surgery. She was also treated with intravenous beta-blockers to maintain the heart rate below 60/min and to keep systolic blood pressure between 100-120 mmHg.  Conclusion:  A high index of suspicion for aortic dissection should be considered in patients with a history of hypertension who present with acute severe chest pain  particularly if the pain is described as 'tearing' or 'ripping ’ and if blood pressure is unequal in both arms. Early diagnosis and management are crucial  and it involves strict blood pressure control and emergency surgical management.  Follow-up:  The patient displayed a good postoperative recovery. She was advised to regularly follow up with cardiology and primary care clinic with a pressure to closely monitor antihypertensive therapy and ensure optimal blood pressure control. Removal of other risk factors like smoking and high cholesterol was also emphasized. She was also referred to genetic counseling considering the development of aortic dissection at a relatively young age."

11,7,46,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial46,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a Middle-Aged Woman with Hypertension and Peripheral Vascular Disease  Case Report:  The patient is a 56-year-old female  a Caucasian business professional residing in New York City  presenting with a sudden onset of sharp  severe chest and back pain that began spontaneously while at rest.   Past medical history is significant for hypertension  peripheral vascular disease  and hypercholesterolemia. She has a 20-year history of smoking and was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago  which has been managed with Amlodipine 10mg daily. Her peripheral vascular disease was diagnosed 5 years ago and has been intermittently treated with Clopidogrel.   She presented to the Emergency Department (ED) where her blood pressure was found to be 190/110 mmHg and pulse rate was 90 bpm. On examination  she appeared in severe discomfort and the pain was described as 'tearing' in nature radiating to her back. Focused cardiovascular assessment revealed weak femoral pulses.   An immediate chest X-ray was performed  showing a widened mediastinum. Electrocardiogram was unremarkable with no signs of myocardial ischemia. The severe pain together with the raised blood pressure and diagnostic imaging pointed towards the suspicion of an aortic dissection. A CT angiogram verified a type A aortic dissection  implicating the progression of the disease from the ascending aorta towards the descending aorta.  Following her diagnosis  emergent cardiothoracic surgery was organized for the management of her thoracic aortic dissection. After a successful procedure  the patient was transferred to the ICU for recovery and placed on antihypertensive medications to manage her blood pressure.  Conclusion:  In conclusion  aortic dissection is a life-threatening emergency that remains high on the differential diagnosis in a patient with sudden onset chest pain. This case emphasizes the paramount importance of the detailed evaluation  early diagnosis  and prompt management in critically ill patients who are at greater risk of developing aortic dissection  such as those with hypertension and peripheral vascular disease.  The patient's demographics  past history of hypertension  peripheral vascular disease  and smoking along with the presenting symptoms helped narrow down the diagnosis. This case exemplifies the crucial role of comprehensive history taking and rapid  targeted investigations in treating life-threatening conditions like aortic dissection.

Patient Information:  An 80-year-old Caucasian man who is a retired engineer presented to the emergency department (ED) with a sudden onset of severe chest pain described as tearing in nature  radiating to the back  with maximal intensity at its onset. The patient reported a history of uncontrolled hypertension  a 40-year history of smoking  and no familial history of cardiovascular disease. There were no allergies reported. His daily medications included amlodipine  lisinopril  and aspirin. He reported adhering to his treatment regimen with occasional missed doses due to his inconsistent follow-up with his primary care physician.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic with a blood pressure of 180/120 mmHg and a heart rate of 100 bpm. His respiration rate was 24 per minute  and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed no murmurs  rubs or gallops. Abdominal and neurological examinations were within normal limits.  Timeline:  Initial assessment and examination occurred at T0. A chest X-ray was conducted at T1 (approximately 30 minutes from arrival)  which did not show any significant abnormalities. A CT scan was performed at T2 (2 hours from admission) due to persistent severe pain.  Diagnostic Assessment:  EKG showed a nonspecific ST change. Lab tests demonstrated a mild elevation in D-Dimer levels. Due to the sudden onset of a severe chest pain with a history of uncontrolled hypertension  the patient underwent emergency chest and abdominal contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT). The CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of Type 1 aortic dissection originating from the ascending aorta extending into the descending aorta.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to control his blood pressure. The cardiothoracic surgery team was consulted urgently  and the patient underwent emergency ascending aorta and hemi-arch replacement with a Dacron graft.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  The post-operative period was uneventful  and the patient was discharged after 15 days. At a follow-up outpatient appointment after three months  he was in good health with stable vital signs and satisfactory healing of the surgical site.   Patient Perspective:  The patient expressed relief over surviving aortic dissection  which he later found to be a life-threatening condition. He thanked the medical staff for their swift diagnosis and treatment. He has since been counselled on the importance of smoking cessation and blood pressure control.  Conclusion:  This case report emphasizes the importance of prompt recognition and urgent surgical management in the domain of acute type 1 aortic dissection  particularly in elderly patients with a long history of smoking and uncontrolled hypertension. Increased awareness of these risk factors among primary care practitioners and emergency department physicians can potentially improve early detection and overall outcomes in these high-risk patients.

He has a history of hypertension  type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  and is a current smoker with a 40-pack year history. He also has a significant familial history  his father died of a heart attack at age 62 and his oldest brother underwent aortic valve surgery at age 55.   Case Presentation:  The patient was brought in by his wife after noticing a sudden and severe pain radiating from his chest to his back. The pain was described as 'tearing' in nature  starting from his chest and radiating to his back  which started approximately 3 hours before arrival at the hospital. He also complained of shortness of breath  sweating and nausea. No fever  vomiting  syncope  or neurological deficiencies were reported. He had no prior history of similar events.  On physical examination  he appeared distressed due to pain. Vital signs revealed blood pressure of 185/100 mmHg in the right arm and 155/90 mmHg in the left arm  heart rate 100 bpm  respiratory rate 20 breaths/min  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed no murmurs or gallops. Initial ECG showed no signs of myocardial ischemia.  Investigations:  Considering his severe pain  disparity in blood pressure between arms and the risk factors  a suspicion for aortic dissection was considered. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan was performed  which revealed a Stanford type A aortic dissection starting from the aortic root extending into the ascending aorta  aortic arch  and descending aorta. Laboratory studies showed a slight increase in WBC (White Blood Cell) counts and slightly elevated D-dimer (indicative of possible blood clot).  Treatment:  Given the diagnosis of Stanford A aortic dissection  the patient was immediately stabilized with intravenous beta-blockers to control hypertension  and preparations were made for emergent surgery. The patient underwent successful aortic root and ascending aorta replacement (Bentall operation) with an artificial graft.  Outcome and Follow-Up:  Postoperatively  the patient was taken to the ICU and was extubated on the second day after surgery. He continued to receive beta-blocker therapy. His postoperative course was uncomplicated  and after 1 week  he was discharged from the hospital under regular medication and follow-up.  Teaching Points:  Aortic dissection is potentially life-threatening and needs immediate diagnosis and intervention. The common initial presentation is acute chest or back pain  often described as tearing or ripping  with possible differences in blood pressure between arms. CTA is the gold standard for diagnosis. Risks include hypertension  smoking  and genetic predisposition.

11,7,53,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial53,Case Report  Patient Information:  Mr. S  a 67-year-old African American male  presented to the emergency department of our hospital with sudden and severe chest pain. The pain was described as a tearing sensation that started in the anterior chest region and radiated to his back. Mr. S reported dizziness  and dyspnea. The patient also has a long-standing history of untreated classic hypertension which he has managed with diet throughout the years. The patient has a history of smoking for the past 40 years and is a long-time moderate alcohol consumer. No other family history of cardiovascular disease was noted in his discourse.  Clinical Presentation & Examination:  On examination  there was a difference in blood pressure of 20mmHg between his left and right arms. He had a pulse of 112 bpm  blood pressure of 186/104 mmHg  resp rate 16/min  and a temperature of 37.2°C. On auscultation  breath sounds were diminished on the right lower zone. The patient appeared pale and sweaty. He had a strong  rapid  and irregular heartbeat.  Diagnostic Assessment:  An immediate electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed where no evidence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was seen. Further tests including CBC  cardiac troponin  blood urea nitrogen (BUN)  and creatinine levels were all within normal limits. A D-Dimer test revealed high levels (1200 ng/ml). Following his D-dimer test result  a CT angiogram was ordered and it showed an aortic dissection starting just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending down the descending thoracic aorta.   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was diagnosed with Stanford Type B aortic dissection. He was managed with intravenous labetalol to control his hypertension. The patient was treated with percutaneous endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR).   Follow Up:  Post-procedure  the patient showed improvement in his symptoms. The patient was started on lifelong anti-hypertensive medication to control his blood pressure. He was instructed to quit smoking  limit alcohol  and maintain a low sodium diet to manage his chronic hypertension.   Conclusion:  Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition which often presents with the sudden onset of severe chest or back pain. In this case  the patient's untreated hypertension and smoking history increased his risk of developing aortic dissection. It's therefore very crucial to control blood pressure in hypertensive patients and counsel them on the risks of smoking and alcohol intake. This case underscores the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients with sudden severe chest or back pain  especially when they have risk factors like untreated hypertension.
11,7,54,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial54,Title: A Case Report of Type A Aortic Dissection in 57-year-old Female: An Intriguing Diagnostic Challenge.  Abstract: We present a case of a 57-year-old woman with severe constant pain in the anterior chest radiating to the back  indicative of acute type A aortic dissection. The case is further complicated by the patient's medical history  making diagnosis and treatment planning difficult.  Introduction: Aortic dissection refers to the life-threatening condition of the aorta  which may result in rupture  or reduced blood flow to other arteries. Type A involves the ascendant aorta  which may spread through the aorta  affecting the heart valves  coronary arteries  or other arterial branches.  Case Presentation: A 57-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe chest pain radiating to her back. On admission  her blood pressure was 170/90 mmHg  pulse rate was 105/min  the temperature was 37.8 C  and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. She reported having a history of hypertension  dyslipidemia  and type II diabetes mellitus under regular medication. She had a smoking history of 20 pack-years and consumed alcohol socially.  The patient reported an immediate onset of the pain  which was tearing in nature  constricting  non-radiating  and not associated with exertion. The pain score was 8/10. No relieving or aggravating factors were identified  except a mild alleviation from sublingual nitroglycerin given at the ED.  Clinical Findings: During cardiovascular examination  her heart sounds were faint with a soft diastolic murmur  further raising suspicion for aortic dissection. No other abnormal sounds or rhythms were noted. Pulses were palpable bilaterally  and no significant difference was recorded between the upper and lower limb pulses.  Diagnosis: The initial ECG revealed nonspecific ST changes without any evidence of ischemia or infarction. Aortic dissection was confirmed by computed tomography angiography (CTA)  which showed a dissection beginning in the ascending aorta and extending to the aortic arch. Laboratory examination revealed a high D-dimer level.  Treatment: The patient was emergently taken to the operating room for a Bentall procedure and received a mechanical aortic valve and graft to replace the ascending aorta. Post-procedure  the patient was transferred to the ICU for management  her blood pressure was kept controlled with medications  and her diabetes and LDL levels were kept managed.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of swift recognition and intervention in the management of aortic dissection. It also emphasizes the added difficulty in diagnostic evaluation stemming from an overlapping presentation with common complaints such as chest pain and impositions from pre-existing conditions like hypertension  dyslipidemia  and diabetes mellitus.
11,7,55,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial55,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a Middle-Aged Female: A Case Report  Introduction: Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition. Its incidence approximates 2.9 cases per 100 000 person per year  as per the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection. Here  we present an unusual case of a middle-aged female with acute aortic dissection.  Patient Information: A 58-year-old Caucasian female presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset severe chest pain  radiating to her back  associated with breathlessness. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension  which was well-controlled with angiotensin receptor blockers. She was a non-smoker and had low alcohol intake levels.  Clinical Findings: On examination  her blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg and her pulse rate was 110 beats per minute  with a discrepancy in the blood pressures measured in both arms. There was a Levine's II/VI diastolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border.  Diagnostic Assessment: Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy with strain pattern and non-specific ST-T changes  but no evidence of acute myocardial ischemia. An emergency transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed dilatation of the ascending aorta  and a suspected intimal flap  indicative of likely aortic dissection.   Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the aorta confirmed Stanford type A aortic dissection starting from the aortic root  extending to the renal arteries with involvement of the right coronary artery. Laboratory results revealed elevated D-Dimers and a minor elevation of cardiac enzymes  most likely associated with the right coronary artery involvement.  Therapeutic Intervention: Due to the presence of aortic root involvement  the patient underwent emergent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery with successful replacement of the ascending aorta  aortic root  and resuspension of the aortic valve. She was also started on aggressive antihypertensive medication therapy with beta-blockers  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  and calcium channel blockers.  Follow-up and Outcome: During her recovery period in the hospital setting  the patient's vital signs remained stable and she had no recurrence of symptoms. She was discharged home on day 15  and after three months of follow-up  she remains asymptomatic  with the aortic repair site intact as evidenced by repeat CTA.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of a high index of clinical suspicion for aortic dissection in patients presenting with severe chest pain. Successful surgical intervention and post-operative management are crucial in achieving optimal patient outcomes.

Presenting Concerns:  Mr. J presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain which started suddenly while he was working at his office. He reported that the pain was tearing in nature  radiating to his back  and continued to intensify over an hour. Mr. J also indicated feeling light-headed and having difficulty breathing. There were no signs of inflammation  no loss of consciousness  no weakness on one side of the body  or any other neurological symptoms.  Clinical Findings:  Upon arrival  the patient was anxious and pale  with visible sweating. Physical examination revealed an elevated blood pressure of 190/105 mmHg  pulse rate 105 beats per minute  and normal respiratory rate. There was no asymmetry in blood pressure readings between his two arms. Auscultation of the chest indicated no murmur.   Diagnostic Assessment:  The EKG revealed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of myocardial infarction. A chest X-ray revealed a widened mediastinum  and blood tests showed a slight elevation of cardiac enzymes. Due to the nature of symptoms and medical history  an immediate Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) was ordered where the presence of a Stanford type A aortic dissection from the ascending aorta to the iliac arteries was confirmed.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Given the critical situation  Mr. J was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to control his blood pressure and heart rate. He was promptly taken to the operating room for surgical intervention. Emergency surgery  involving replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve using a composite graft  was successfully carried out without complications.  Follow-up:  Post-surgery  Mr. J was put on lifelong beta-blockers and antiplatelet drugs to manage his high blood pressure. He was counseled about the risks of smoking  and cessation strategies were discussed with him. He was also referred to a hypertension specialist for aggressive blood pressure control. His progress will be monitored through follow-up visits scheduled every three months.  Conclusion:  This case demonstrates the importance of high clinical suspicion for aortic dissection in patients presenting with sudden severe chest pain  especially those with risk factors such as hypertension and smoking. Prompt recognition  immediate diagnostic measures  and timely surgical intervention can be lifesaving for patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection.

He also had a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for 40 years.  Clinical Findings  Upon arrival  the patient described the pain as """"tearing"""" and rated it 10 on a scale of 0 to 10. The pain was not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Vital signs showed blood pressure of 180/95 mmHg  pulse rate of 100 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed diaphoresis and anxiety but no focal neurological deficits or peripheral pulse discrepancies.  Diagnostic Assessment  An urgent 12-Lead EKG showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes but no evidence of acute myocardial ischemia. A chest X-ray showed a normal cardiac silhouette without pleural effusion or widened mediastinum. Due to the severity of the pain and the high-risk nature of his medical history  a Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) was done and revealed a Stanford type A aortic dissection extending from the aortic root to the iliac arteries.   Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was immediately referred to cardiovascular surgery for emergency ascending aortic graft repair with a Dacron graft. In addition  a beta-blocker  esmolol  was administered intravenously in the interim to lower the shear stress on the aortic wall. The surgery was successful  and the postoperative period was uneventful.  Follow-up and Outcomes  Postoperatively  the patient was moved to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close hemodynamic monitoring. He was later transitioned to the telemetry floor and eventually discharged home on postoperative day 14. The patient was prescribed lifelong beta-blockers and daily low-dose aspirin. He was also strongly advised to stop smoking and attend regular follow-ups in the cardiovascular clinic.  Patient Perspective  The patient acknowledged his severe condition and expressed gratitude for the successful diagnosis and surgery.

11,7,69,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial69,Case Report: Aortic Dissection in a 54-year-old Male  Patient Information  The patient  Mr. Johnson  is a 54-year-old African-American male who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of severe chest pain  which he described as 'tearing' in nature. The pain was localized in his upper back and radiated to his chest and abdomen area. He has also experienced fainting spells and shortness of breath.   Medical History   Mr. Johnson has a significant medical history  including moderately controlled hypertension (17 years)  hyperlipidemia (10 years)  and a two-pack-per-day smoking habit for the past 30 years. He denies any history of diabetes  heart diseases  or inheritable conditions. He has no known drug allergies and is currently on Amlodipine and Lipitor for his hypertension and hyperlipidemia respectively.   Clinical Findings  On physical examination  he had varied blood pressure readings; higher in the right arm (189/110 mmHg) than in the left (154/92 mmHg). Auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur  and he had a diminished pulse in his lower extremities. In terms of psychological appearance  he appeared to be extremely anxious and in distress.  Diagnostic Assessment  Based on the initial findings  a suspected diagnosis of aortic dissection was made. To confirm the diagnosis  a Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) was initially performed  which showed a dissection flap in the ascending aorta. Further confirmation and classification of the aortic dissection were done with aortic computed tomography angiogram (CTA)  which revealed a Stanford type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the level of the renal arteries. The coronary arteries know no abnormalities.  Therapeutic Intervention  Mr. Johnson was treated surgically due to the type of dissection  involving the ascending aorta. A joint decision was made with the cardiothoracic surgical team to perform an ascending aortic replacement. He was placed on medication including intravenous beta-blockers  specifically Labetalol  to help manage his blood pressure before and after the surgery.  Post-operative course  Postoperatively  Mr. Johnson's recovery was successful without complications. Hypertension was well controlled with medication  and he was strictly advised to quit smoking. He received education about lifestyle modifications and was counseled on the significance of medication adherence.  Follow-Up  Mr. Johnson was discharged home after 10 days in the hospital. Regular follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor his progress and to ensure that he is recovering well. He was also referred to a Smoking Cessation program to help him quit smoking permanently.   This case report signifies the importance of prompt diagnosis and management of aortic dissection  especially in patients with high-risk factors like hypertension and smoking. An early diagnosis leads to improved patient outcomes and reduced morbidity and mortality.

Medical History: The patient has a known history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 15 years and was a chronic smoker until five years prior. He had been diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus three years back and takes metformin 500mg bid. There is also a documented history of hyperlipidaemia controlled with statins.  Chief Complaint: Intense  unaccustomed chest pain radiating to the back  described as tearing in nature. The pain began while the patient was at rest  lasted for about two hours  with no report of accompanying symptoms like palpitations  breathlessness  or syncope.  Clinical Findings: On examination  the patient was in distress  with a blood pressure of 175/110 mmHg and a heart rate of 98 beats per minute. The breath sounds were equal bilaterally. The cardiovascular examination revealed regular rhythm but a faint diastolic murmur was present. The pulses were asymmetrical  with weaker femoral and popliteal pulses compared to radial pulses. Peripheral cyanosis or neurological deficits were absent.  Diagnostic Assessment: Given the history and presentation  a provisional diagnosis of acute aortic dissection was made. The patient was emergently sent for a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest  abdomen  and pelvis  which confirmed a type A aortic dissection commencing just above the aortic valve and extending into the right common iliac artery.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was immediately started on intravenous antihypertensive medications to achieve the targeted blood pressure and was referred for emergency surgical intervention. The surgery was performed successfully  involving total aortic root replacement with a composite valve-conduit and reimplantation of the coronary arteries.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: The postoperative period was uneventful with good control of blood pressure. He was discharged on postoperative day 10 with medications including beta-blockers and regular follow-ups were arranged in the cardiology clinic.

11,7,71,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial71,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a Patient with Longstanding Hypertension: A Case Report   Introduction: Aortic dissection (AD) is a cardiovascular condition characterized by a tear in the wall of the aorta  causing an often fatal medical emergency. This report concerns a 67-year-old Caucasian male with a history of chronic hypertension  who presented with symptoms suggestive of a Type B aortic dissection.   Case Presentation:   Patient Information: The patient is a 67-year old Caucasian male from Texas  USA. He is married with two children and works as an accountant. He was admitted to the hospital with severe intermittent chest and back pain of sudden onset that had persisted for about 7 hours.   Clinical Findings: On examination  he had a blood pressure of 200/110 mmHg  pulse rate of 100 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. He had an asymmetrical radial pulse and difference in blood pressure between the arms indicating a vascular issue. He exhibited no signs of trauma in his upper body.  Clinical history: The patient had a 20-year history of hypertension and was on medication (Losartan  Amlodipine). He had a 10-year history of type-2 diabetes mellitus and was on Metformin 1000mg twice daily. He was also a smoker with a 30 pack-year history but had no history of drug or alcohol abuse. His family history was significant  with his father passing away from an acute myocardial infarction at an age of 64.  Diagnostic Assessment: Initial ECG showed no signs of myocardial ischemia. A high-resolution computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan was conducted which identified a suspected intimal flap and false lumen  indicative of a Type B aortic dissection originating just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending beyond the abdominal aorta.  Therapeutic Intervention: Conservative medical therapy was initiated with intravenous labetalol to achieve a target blood pressure of <120 mmHg systolic and heart rate of <60 bpm. Pain relief was obtained with narcotic analgesia.   Follow-up and outcomes: The patient showed improvement with conservative therapy with a reduction in pain and stabilization of vital signs. He was discharged after a week in stable condition  with monthly follow-up appointments and instructed to continue on antihypertensive medication and pain relief.   Discussion: This case demonstrates the diagnostic challenges associated with aortic dissection  a condition that often mimics other conditions leading to delays in diagnosis. It also emphasizes the importance of controlling hypertension  which is a common risk factor for aortic dissection.

Demographics:   The patient lives in a suburban neighborhood in Austin  Texas with his wife and pet dog. Though he is a habitual smoker (20 cigarettes per day) for the last thirty-five years  he claimed to be a moderate alcohol consumer. There is no known family history of cardiovascular conditions  but the patient confirmed that his late mother was a diabetic before her passing.  Medical History:   The patient has a known long-standing history of hypertension which has been uncontrolled in recent years. His other significant medical history includes obesity (BMI 30.2)  type II diabetes mellitus diagnosed in 2011  and high cholesterol identified five years ago. His regular medications include metformin 500 mg b.i.d. for the diabetes  atorvastatin 40 mg once daily for the hypercholesterolemia  and losartan 50 mg b.i.d. for the hypertension. At the time of presentation  he denied any recent medication alterations or changes.  Clinical Findings:   On physical examination  his blood pressure was found to be wildly different in both arms (right - 180/88mmHg  left - 148/80mmHg). Pulse was noted as 110 per minute and regular. His lungs were clear  and the cardiac examination revealed no murmur or rub but a discrepancy in peripheral pulses. Neurological examination revealed no gross sensory-motor deficits.  Diagnosis:   Based on the clinical presentation and examination findings  an emergent computed tomography angiography (CTA) was urgently obtained which confirmed the dissection commencing at the ascending aorta and extending past the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta  ultimately diagnosing him with Stanford Type A aortic dissection.  Patient Outcome:   Upon diagnosis confirmation  the patient was emergently transferred to cardiothoracic surgery for a successful ascending aorta and hemi-arch replacement. His post-operative course was uneventful  and he was discharged on postoperative day 10 with rigorous blood pressure control measures.  Conclusion:  Though this patient had multiple atherosclerotic risk factors including long-standing uncontrolled hypertension  smoking  obesity  type II diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  an acute aortic dissection was an unexpected and rare presentation that warranted immediate surgical attention. This case underscores the importance of recognizing the discrepancy in blood pressure and pulses in the clinical examination  and timely interception in order to mitigate severe consequences. It also highlights the correlation between existing risk factors and the likelihood of this life-threatening condition.

11,7,77,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial77,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection in a 58-year-old Male with Hypertension: A Case Report  Introduction: An acute case of aortic dissection diagnosed in the emergency department at our medical center. Aortic dissection  a severe  potentially life-threatening medical condition that involves the inner layer of the aorta wall  often goes undiagnosed due to its rare occurrence and the variation in clinical presentations.  Case Description:  Patient Information: The patient was a 58-year-old Caucasian male who was previously diagnosed with hypertension and managed with antihypertensive medications. He had a 30 pack-year history of smoking but denied alcohol or illicit drug use. He had no family history of aortic dissection or autoimmune disorder  hence the minimal consideration for aortic disease.  Clinical findings: The patient presented with a sudden onset of excruciating chest pain that began approximately two hours before admission. The pain was characterized as tearing and radiating to the back. Upon examination  his blood pressure was elevated significantly (210/120 mmHg)  with pulse somewhat irregular. There were differences in blood pressure and pulse between his right and left arms. Preliminary EKG showed no signs of myocardial infarction.  Diagnostic assessment: Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was completed urgently. The evaluation revealed an aortic dissection starting from the ascending aorta and extending to the iliac arteries  a Stanford type A aortic dissection. Blood work showed slightly elevated D-dimer levels. No other significant biochemical abnormalities were identified.  Therapeutic intervention: The patient was immediately treated with intravenous beta-blockers to control hypertension and relieve the shearing forces on the aortic wall. Emergent cardiothoracic surgery was consulted  and the patient underwent successful surgical repair of the ascending aorta.  Follow-up and outcomes: The patient's post-operative course was uneventful. Antihypertensive medication (beta-blockers) was continued. The patient was counseled on smoking cessation and referred to a cardiac rehabilitation program. On the follow-up outpatient visit at 6 weeks post-discharge  the patient was doing well with improved hypertension control and no recurrent symptoms.   Discussion: Aortic dissection is a frequently fatal and often missed diagnosis due to its low prevalence and varied presentations. Hypertension  as in our patient  is a common risk factor. Successful management involves rapid diagnosis  immediate medical management to control hypertension  and urgent surgical intervention in proximal dissections.  Conclusion: The potential for aortic dissection should always be considered in patients presenting with severe chest pain  particularly in those with a history of hypertension. Quick diagnosis and treatment can significantly impact improving the outcomes and reducing mortality associated with this condition.
11,7,78,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial78,Title: Aortic Dissection in a Middle-Aged Asian Male with Hypertension: A Case Report  Background  Aortic dissection is a severe condition in which the inner layer of the aorta tears. As blood surges through the tear  it causes the inner and middle layers of the aorta to separate (dissect). The incidence of aortic dissection is estimated to be several per 100 000 people per year.  Case presentation  Our patient is a 55-year-old Asian male with a past medical history significant for hypertension  which had been inconsistently controlled with medication over the past ten years. He has no known allergies and no other notable personal or familial medical history. His only medication is Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg which he is taking irregularly. The patient is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol moderately. His BMI is 29 indicating overweightness indicative of a physical activity deficiency.  The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden severe chest pain  described as a tearing or ripping sensation  that radiated to his back. Additionally  he reported dizziness  profuse sweating  and nausea. On physical examination  the blood pressure varied significantly between the two arms. A discernable pulse deficit was noted  and a diastolic murmur could be heard in the left third intercostal space.  Investigations  Given the presentation and physical exam findings  an aortic dissection was highly suspected. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax confirmed a type A (Stanford classification) aortic dissection beginning just above the aortic valve and extending to the bifurcation of the aorta. His blood pressure in the emergency department was elevated at 184/110 mmHg.  Management and outcome  The patient was initially stabilized with intravenous beta-blockers to control his heart rate and blood pressure  which were reduced to safer levels before he was taken for emergent surgery. The surgery was successful with replacement of the ascending aorta using a graft. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful; he was discharged on the 14th postoperative day and prescribed antihypertensives and statins. On the follow-up visit 1 month later  the patient was doing well with good compliance to medication and lifestyle modification advice  including smoking cessation and dietary changes.  Discussion  This case emphasizes the critical nature of aortic dissections and the importance of prompt diagnosis and aggressive management. The patient's hypertension  a significant risk factor for aortic dissection  was unfortunately not well managed  making him more susceptible to this life-threatening condition. It also demonstrates the importance of regularly taking prescribed medications and improving lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise for mitigating such severe cardiovascular risks.

Medical History:   The patient has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 10 years and smokes 1 pack of cigarettes daily. Her family history is positive for cardiovascular disease  including her father who died of an aortic aneurysm at a similar age. She is not diabetic  but was diagnosed with high cholesterol 5 years ago for which she takes Simvastatin. No history of prior surgeries or known allergies. She does not engage in regular physical activities  and her diet is largely uncontrolled featuring high-fat and high-sodium foods.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient was brought to the Emergency Department complaining about a sudden  severe pain in the anterior chest  described as tearing  and radiating to the back. The patient is presenting symptoms of severe anxiety and fear of death.  Physical Examination:  Vital signs on admission were as follows: blood pressure was 190/110 mmHg  pulse rate was 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute and her temperature was 37.4°C. Cardiac examination was largely normal with no evident murmur and regular rhythm. Mild tenderness was noted in the epigastric area. Neurological examination was normal. No peripheral pulses were missing  but a pressure difference was appreciated in upper limbs (right arm systolic BP 20mmHg higher than left arm).  Imaging and Laboratory Findings:  Given the symptoms  investigations were directed towards ruling out acute aortic syndromes. An electrocardiogram showed no signs of a myocardial infarction. Troponins and D-Dimer were elevated. The chest X-ray was normal  however  computed tomography (CT) angiography showed an intimal flap from the root of aorta extending to the right common iliac artery suggestive of a Stanford Type A Aortic dissection.  Treatment:  The patient was immediately started on pain management and intravenous labetalol to control her blood pressure. After initial stabilization  the patient underwent an emergency ascending aortic replacement with a synthetic graft in line with the standard of care. Post-operative recovery was uneventful  and the patient was discharged two weeks after the surgery on an antihypertensive regimen and a statin. She was also referred to a dietitian and a cardiac rehabilitation program.  Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment of acute aortic dissection especially in high-risk patients. Clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion in hypertensive patients presenting with acute chest pain. Prompt imaging studies and surgical intervention can significantly reduce the associated morbidity and mortality.
11,7,81,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial81,Case Report: Aortic Dissection in a 65-year-old Male with Hypertension  Introduction: This case involves a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presented with sharp substernal chest pain that radiated to the back. The patient had a known history of poorly controlled hypertension and 30-year history of smoking. He was not on any regular medications and had no previous surgical history. His family history was significant for cardiovascular diseases  including his father who had suffered from a myocardial infarction at a similar age.  Clinical Findings: The patient was in clear distress upon arrival in the hospital  profusely sweating and complaining of severe 'ripping' chest pain. His blood pressure readings were significantly asymmetrical  with the right arm reading 170/100 mmHg and the left reading 150/95 mmHg. His heart rate was elevated at 120 bpm and he maintained an oxygen saturation level of 92% on room air. Physical examination revealed a slightly diminished pulse in the left lower limb. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no evidence of ischemia or infarction  but there were signs of left ventricular hypertrophy.  Diagnostic Assessment: Given the nature of his pain  the asymmetry of his blood pressure readings  and findings on physical examination  he was suspected of having an aortic dissection. A Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) scan of his chest was completed  confirming the diagnosis of Type A Aortic Dissection. The dissection extended from the ascending aorta to the level of the renal arteries.  Therapeutic Intervention: The gravity of the situation was explained to the patient who was then immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers and sodium nitroprusside to control blood pressure and heart rate. Consultation with a cardiovascular surgeon was made promptly and the patient was rushed to the operating theatre for emergency repair using a graft replacement of the ascending aorta  in order to prevent rupture.  Follow-up and Outcome: The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. An echocardiogram at a week after surgery showed normal aortic dimensions and function. He was discharged on metoprolol and lisinopril  along with smoking cessation counseling and advice to maintain a low sodium diet. Blood pressure control was reinforced and regular cardiology follow-ups were arranged.  Discussion: This case highlights the urgency of considering aortic dissection in any patient presenting with severe  tearing chest pain along with hypertensive history and asymmetric blood pressure readings. An early diagnosis  aggressive control of blood pressure  and prompt surgical intervention can effectively prevent catastrophic outcomes.  Patient's consent for publication had been obtained.

His pulse was irregular at 110 beats/min. Auscultation of his chest revealed a diastolic murmur. An immediate ECG showed signs of left ventricular hypertrophy but no signs of myocardial ischaemia or infarction. Lab tests revealed elevated D-dimer levels. Chest x-ray was non-specific; however  a subsequent computed tomography angiogram (CTA) showed a dissection flap in the ascending aorta  confirming the diagnosis of aortic dissection.  Treatment and Outcome: The patient was immediately managed with pain control and antihypertensive medications to control his blood pressure. An emergency cardiothoracic consult was obtained  and the patient underwent successful surgical repair of his dissecting aneurysm. Post-surgery  the patient was kept in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for close monitoring. His post-operative period was uneventful  and he was discharged after 10 days with advice to regularly monitor his BP and strict adherence to his antihypertensive medications.  Follow-Up: Although his early post-operative phase was uneventful  prolonged follow-up is required due to his high-risk state from hypertension and high cholesterol. Regular 6-monthly follow-up consultations and annual CT angiograms for surveillance of his aortic disease were recommended. Lifestyle modifications  including a regular exercise regimen and healthy dietary habits  were also advised  and the patient was directed to regular outpatient clinic for further management of his chronic diseases.     
11,7,83,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial83,Title: Aortic Dissection in a 65-Year-Old Male with a History of Hypertension: A Case Report  Abstract: This case report describes a 65-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. D  with a medical history of long-standing hypertension who presented to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms of acute chest pain and was diagnosed with aortic dissection.  Demographics: The patient  Mr. D  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired petroleum engineer  non-smoker  and drinks alcohol socially. He resides in Toledo  Ohio  USA and is a widower with two adult children.  Medical History: Mr. D has a ten-year history of hypertension managed with Lisinopril. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia controlled with Atorvastatin. However  the patient has a poor record of medication compliance. He had no family history of heart disease. He had no previous history of surgery or hospitalization. He denied any allergies to food or medications.   Presenting Issue: Mr. D presented to the ED with complaints of sudden-onset  tearing chest discomfort radiating to his back. On admission  his blood pressure was significantly asymmetric (160/90 mmHg in the right arm and 110/70 mmHg in the left arm)  and heart rate was 110 bpm.  Investigations: Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no signs of ischemia. Nonetheless  given the severe chest and back pain associated with differences in blood pressure in both arms  a computed tomography (CT) angiography scan was immediately ordered. The CT angiography scan confirmed the presence of a Stanford type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta through to the descending aorta and superior mesenteric artery. Laboratory investigations revealed mild leukocytosis  elevated D-dimer  and unremarkable cardiac enzyme levels.  Management and Outcome: The patient was immediately managed with intravenous labetalol to reduce the blood pressure and heart rate  and analgesia was provided for the pain. He was promptly taken for an emergency surgical intervention. His postoperative recovery was uneventful  and he was discharged home on postoperative day ten. A strict follow-up program  including a cardiac rehabilitation program and counseling for antihypertensive medication compliance  was set up for the patient.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients presenting with acute  severe chest pain  especially in individuals with a history of hypertension. Early recognition and immediate management can radically affect the outcome for these patients.
11,7,84,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial84,Title: A Case Report of Type B Aortic Dissection in a 58-year-old Male with Prior Hypertension   Case Presentation:   The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male  a resident of Nebraska  who presented to the emergency department with sudden onset  sharp  and tearing abdominal pain which gradually moved to his back. He is married  employed as an office worker  and is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. He has a past medical history of essential hypertension for the past 10 years  managed by atenolol and lisinopril  yet he is known for inconsistent medication compliance. There was no evidence of familial cardiovascular disorder or other genetic disorders.   Clinical Examination and Investigations:   Upon examination  his pulse rate was 92 BPM  BP was differing in both upper limbs  showing values of 160/100 mm Hg in the right and 140/90 mm Hg in the left  body mass index (BMI) was at 28 indicating overweight  while he had a regular rhythm with no murmurs on auscultation. Neurological examination revealed no pathological findings. Laboratory tests showed raised D-dimer levels but otherwise were within normal range.   Further radiographic evaluation was conducted with a computed tomography angiography (CTA)  which confirmed the diagnosis of Type B aortic dissection  showing a dissection beginning just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending to the descending aorta. The patient's left renal artery was seen arising from the false lumen  suggestive of malperfusion.   Management:   Due to the complicated nature of the dissection  the patient was managed immediately to control his blood pressure using intravenous beta-blockers  titrated to a goal heart rate of 60 bpm and systolic blood pressure less than 120 mmHg. He was started on nitroprusside for additional blood pressure control. The patient was referred for endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) to address the malperfusion of the left kidney.   The surgery was successful with no immediate complications. Post-operative management involved strict control of blood pressure and heart rate  and high-intensity follow-up to monitor any progression or complications. He was further advised on the importance of adherence to his antihypertensive medications and modification in lifestyle including dietary advice  weight loss tactics  and motivation for regular physical activity.  Conclusion:   The present case demonstrates that early recognition and prompt intervention are crucial in managing aortic dissection. This condition should be suspected in any patient with a history of hypertension presenting with uncharacteristic pain. Despite the patient's inconsistent compliance with antihypertensive medication and being overweight  the successful management and outcome indicate that with an appropriate multidisciplinary approach  aortic dissection can be effectively managed.

His lungs were clear on auscultation  and no neurological deficits were noted.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  Due to the severity and nature of his symptoms  an immediate CT angiogram was ordered. The CT scan revealed an aortic dissection originating just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending into the descending thoracic aorta. Lab results showed elevated D-dimer levels but were otherwise within normal limits.  Therapeutic Focus and Assessment:  Due to the type of aortic dissection (Type B)  a non-surgical approach was chosen. Initial treatment involved control of blood pressure to prevent further worsening of aortic dissection. Intravenous beta-blockers were administered  followed by nitroprusside to further reduce blood pressure and shearing forces. Serial imaging showed no progression of the dissection.   Follow-up and Outcomes:  During hospital stay the patient's pain resolved and his blood pressure normalized. He was discharged on beta-blockers  ACE inhibitors and statins  with urgent referral to outpatient hypertension and lipid clinic. He was advised to refrain from heavy lifting and was given advice on smoking cessation. Regular follow-ups were scheduled to monitor his condition.  Patient Perspective:   The patient expressed relief that his condition did not need surgical intervention. He expressed commitment to follow the recommended lifestyle changes and medication regimen to control his hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He also committed to participating in a smoking cessation program.   Informed Consent:  Informed consent was taken from the patient for writing and submitting this case report. He was ensured that his identity would remain anonymous and healthcare information would remain confidential.   Take-Away:  This case highlights the importance of urgent diagnostic evaluation and management in patients presenting with severe chest pain and variable blood pressures in different arms. It also emphasizes the detrimental effect of uncontrolled hypertension  tobacco consumption  and hyperlipidemia in contributing to life-threatening conditions like aortic dissections.
11,7,97,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial97,Case Report:  Presenting Patient Information: Mr. B  a 69-year-old African-American male with a history of hypertension and nicotine addiction  presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of severe sharp chest and upper-back pain that started suddenly several hours before arrival.  Past Medical History: Mr. B has a documented history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 20 years. He has also been a consistent smoker  consuming about a pack of cigarettes daily for nearly 50 years. In addition  he has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with both his father and older brother having succumbed to myocardial infarctions. He has no history of diabetes  dyslipidemia  or known heart disease. Despite repeated admonitions from health-care providers  Mr. B has shown poor compliance with his antihypertensive medications and has not received regular health check-ups.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  the patient appeared distressed and diaphoretic. His systolic blood pressure (BP) reading was 205 mm Hg  and his diastolic BP was 110 mm Hg. There was a noticeable difference in the BP between the right arm (205/110 mmHg) and the left arm (160/90 mmHg). Auscultation revealed a faint diastolic murmur best heard over the right second intercostal space. Pulses in the lower extremities were palpable and symmetric. The remainder of the cardiovascular exam was unremarkable. Neurologic examination did not reveal any focal deficits.  Diagnostic Assessment: Promptly  an electrocardiogram was obtained  which did not show any obvious signs of myocardial infarction. A CT angiography was ordered due to the suspicion of aortic dissection. The scan confirmed the diagnosis  revealing a type A aortic dissection starting just after the aortic valve and extending into the descending aorta.  Treatment and Outcomes: The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to control his hypertension and heart rate. He was then urgently sent to the operating room for surgical intervention  where a successful ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement was conducted. Postoperatively  he was transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. After a closely monitored recovery period of two weeks  Mr. B was discharged with strict advice to discontinue smoking and properly manage his hypertension.  Conclusion: This case underlines the importance of early recognition of aortic dissection symptoms  especially in patients with significant risk factors like uncontrolled hypertension and consistent smoking. Regular follow-ups and proper medication adherence are pivotal in preventing such life-threatening complications.  Learning Points: This case of Mr. B serves as a reminder to clinicians of the classic presentation of aortic dissection and its association with long-standing uncontrolled hypertension  nicotine addiction  and other cardiovascular risk factors.
11,7,98,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial98,"Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Information:  Mr. A.J.  a 67-year-old African American male  presented himself at the emergency department with sudden severe chest pain. He is a retired lawyer  married with two adult children  and a resident of Connecticut. The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension  which has been managed with lifestyle modifications and medications (lisinopril). He is a non-smoker but admits to moderate alcohol use. He has no known allergies. A paternal family history of heart disease was noted.  History of Present Illness:  Mr. A.J. described his chest pain as """"tearing"""" and """"radiating"""" to his back. Pain onset was acute  starting within an hour of presentation  without any warning signs. He reported feeling short of breath and dizzy coupled with a cold sweat.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  he appeared to be in severe distress. Vital signs revealed blood pressure of 180/105 mmHg  heart rate 105 beats per minute  respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation 96% at room air. Auscultation revealed no significant heart or lung sounds. The electrocardiogram demonstrated nonspecific repolarization abnormalities but no evidence of a myocardial infarction.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Given the patient's presenting symptoms and history of hypertension  there was a high suspicion of aortic dissection. A CT angiogram was promptly performed which confirmed Stanford type B aortic dissection starting from the origin of the left subclavian artery and extending to the iliac arteries. No malperfusion syndromes were present and the patient was hemodynamically stable.  Therapeutic Intervention:  He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and medical management. His blood pressure was aggressively controlled with intravenous esmolol to achieve a systolic blood pressure of less than 120mmHg and a heart rate less than 60 bpm. Analgesics were provided to manage the severe pain.   Follow-up and Outcome:  His pain was reasonably controlled and blood pressure maintained within the desired range over the next 48 hours. After being stabilized  he underwent endovascular repair surgery. His recovery was uneventful and was discharged with recommendations for regular outpatient follow-up with cardiothoracic surgery  cardiology  and internal medicine teams. He was also prescribed beta-blockers and statins to manage his blood pressure and cholesterol  and advised lifestyle modifications including a low-sodium diet  regular exercise  and alcohol moderation.  Patient Perspective:  Mr. A.J was distressed about his sudden health condition but expressed his relief over the results after surgery. His adherence to follow-up appointments and medication regimen has been excellent.  Informed Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report and any accompanying images.  This case demonstrates the importance of having a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection when patients with risk factors present with acute onset severe chest or back pain. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management can significantly improve patient's prognosis."
11,7,99,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial99,Title: Morphological Presentation and Therapeutic Management of Aortic Dissection: A Case Report  Patient Information:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  a resident of Portland  Oregon  and is retired from his job in construction. His past medical history involves smoking tobacco for about 30 years and moderate alcohol consumption. His family history is significant for coronary heart disease on his mother's side. He has a documented history of hypertension for the past ten years and was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 3 years ago. Compliance to antihypertensives (Amlodipine and Lisinopril) and a statin (Atorvastatin) was regular. However  follow-up visits have been infrequent and inconsistent with the last recorded blood pressure at the clinic indicating poorly controlled hypertension at 160/95 mm Hg.  Clinical Findings:  The patient arrived at the emergency department complaining of sudden onset and continuous  intense chest pain radiating to the back and shortness of breath on mild exertion that started two hours before presentation. He also complained of weakness in his left leg  denying any sensory loss. On physical examination  there was a noted discrepancy in the blood pressure measurements between his two arms  and a weak pulse was reported in his left lower extremity. His heart rate was 118  and he was sweating profusely. Neither bruit nor murmur was heard in auscultation. Chest x-ray hinted at mediastinal widening.  Diagnostic Assessment: Electrocardiography was performed  which showed signs suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy with strain pattern but no signs indicative of myocardial ischemia. CT angiography of the chest confirmed the diagnosis revealing an aortic dissection starting just after the origin of the left subclavian artery down to the level of the renal arteries. Lab findings revealed a slightly increased white blood cell count and slightly elevated troponin.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient's blood pressure and heart rate were immediately managed using IV labetalol to a target systolic blood pressure of 110-120 mmHg. The decision was made to carry out emergency surgery for this type 1 aortic dissection. The patient underwent successful surgical repair involving replacement of the ascending aorta and hemi-arch with a synthetic graft.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for a post-operative stay. Over time  the patient made a steady recovery and was discharged after two weeks with advice to continue antihypertensive medication and to regularly attend follow-up appointments. The patient has been compliant with medications and has maintained a blood pressure of around 130/80 mmHg in outpatient clinic follow-up visits.  Patient Perspective:  The patient expressed relief after the successful surgery. He was willing to comply with the medical advice given and showed a keen interest in lifestyle modification to prevent future cardiovascular events.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of regular follow-up visits and proper control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients to prevent serious conditions such as aortic dissection. The discrepancy in pulse strength and blood pressure measurements in upper limbs could be potential clues for aortic dissection diagnosis in acute settings. Early surgical interventions are crucial and can be life-saving for patients with an ascending aortic dissection.
11,7,100,diagnosis11-prompt7-trial100,"Case Report: Aortic Dissection in a 62-Year-Old Male  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male. He has a history of smoking and was diagnosed with hypertension five years ago. He is currently unemployed but used to work as a construction worker. The patient is single  lives alone  and has no children. His weight is recorded as 240 lbs with a height of 5'10"""".  Past Medical History  The patient's relevant medical history includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  all managed with medication. He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking but quit five years ago upon experiencing a mild stroke  which led to no permanent disability. Additionally  the patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease with his father having died from a myocardial infarction at age 64. There is no prior history of surgeries or other significant medical conditions.  Presenting Complaint  The patient presented to the emergency department at night complaining of severe chest and back pain. The pain was acute in onset  tearing in quality  and was of sudden onset. The pain radiated to the back and did not relieve with rest. There was also associated shortness of breath.  Physical Examination  Upon physical examination  the patient was noted to be in severe distress. Vital signs showed a heart rate of 110 bpm  blood pressure was 190/95 mm Hg in the right arm and 175/90 mm Hg in the left arm. Respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. His cardiovascular exam showed a 2/6 early diastolic murmur along the left sternal border.  Investigations  Immediate electrocardiogram (EKG) did not show any signs of myocardial ischemia. Lab results showed slightly elevated troponin I levels but were negative for other cardiac enzymes. Chest X-Ray showed widened mediastinum. Based on clinical suspicion and presentation  a CT angiogram was performed which confirmed an aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the proximal segments of the right and left renal arteries.  Management  The patient was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers and was taken to surgical theatre for an emergent surgical repair of the dissection.  Postoperative Course  The surgery was successful and the patient was shifted to the ICU for monitoring with stable vital signs. Postoperative recovery was slow but uneventful. Patient was discharged on postoperative day 10 on oral antihypertensives and statins. He was advised a follow-up in the surgical outpatient department after 2 weeks.  Discussion  This case illustrates the need for immediate medical intervention when a patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an aortic dissection. Delay in diagnosis or treatment can lead to life-threatening complications. A high index of suspicion is necessary in high-risk individuals including those with hypertension  smokers  and those with a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  "

11,9,1,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial1,Patient Information: The patient is Mr. Harry Styles  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  residing in New England.  Presenting Condition: Mr. Styles presented with severe chest pain radiating to his back. His blood pressure was significantly different in each arm  and he appeared extremely anxious.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for 10 years. He is also a former smoker with a 40-pack-year history  quit smoking five years ago. He is known to have high cholesterol levels but is largely uncompliant with his medications.   Family History: The patient's father had an aortic aneurysm and his mother had hypertension. One of his siblings died at the age of 58 due to heart attack  and the other has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2.  Clinical Examination and Diagnostic Findings: On examination  his pulse was irregular and a systolic murmur was noted. An immediate CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta (Stanford Type A). Laboratory tests showed slightly elevated cardiac enzymes  indicative of myocardial distress caused by the dissection.  Plan of Care: The patient was immediately started on IV beta-blockers to control his blood pressure and heart rate  anxiously awaiting a cardiovascular surgery consultation for a probable surgical repair.  Throughout his hospital stay  the patient's blood pressure  heart rate  and pain level will be closely monitored. He will also be gauged for signs of complications  such as organ failure or stroke. Following this acute phase  the patient is expected to need long-term medication to control his blood pressure and prevent future aortic dissections.   Considering his smoking history  noncompliance with hypertensive medications  and familial history of cardiovascular disease  long-term management will need to focus on lifestyle modification  close cardiovascular follow-up  and strict compliance with medication. Psychological support might also be considered given the patient's anxiety levels.  Understanding the gravity of his condition  we have informed Mr. Styles about the importance of medication adherence and lifestyle modifications (like regular exercise  healthy diet  and quitting smoking) to prevent further cardiovascular issues. His family is also kept in the loop and they have been receptive to the proposed plan of care. 
11,9,2,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial2,Patient Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: The patient in the case is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. George Smith. The patient is retired and lives with his wife. There's no record of alcohol or tobacco use. He has two adult children  both in good health.   Medical History: Mr. Smith has a medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for the past 10 years. His hypertension is managed by Enalapril and Amlodipine  with sub-optimal blood pressure control. The hypercholesterolemia is managed by statins. He is not known to have diabetes mellitus or other comorbid conditions. He is not allergic to any drugs. Mr. Smith was previously seen by Orthopedics concerning chronic low back pain  managed with occasional over-the-counter NSAIDs.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith presented to the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain  described as sharp and tearing. The pain started approximately two hours prior to his arrival and radiates to his back. There was an associated onset of diaphoresis.  Family History: There is no family history of cardiovascular disease  although both of his parents passed away due to age-related diseases.   Findings: On physical examination  the patient was pale and sweating. His blood pressure was found to be 200/100 mmHg  and pulse was 120 bpm  regular rhythm. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal first and second heart sounds with no added sounds or murmurs. Chest auscultation revealed normal breath sounds on both sides.   Investigations and Diagnosis: An immediate ECG was done which ruled out a myocardial infarction. A chest X-ray was taken  revealing mediastinal widening  which raised suspicion of an aortic dissection. A contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed the diagnosis  revealing a type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the aortic arch.   Plan: The patient was immediately started on IV beta-blockers to control the hypertension and heart rate. Upon diagnosis confirmation  cardiovascular surgery was consulted  and the patient was taken to OR for an emergent surgical repair of the dissecting aorta.  Discussion: Aortic dissection is a catastrophic medical emergency often related to poorly controlled hypertension and other predisposing factors. Presenting symptoms can mimic other conditions like myocardial infarction  which can sometimes delay diagnosis. Management is often surgical  especially for type A dissections  as in the present case. Prognosis depends upon the promptly and accuracy of diagnosis  and surgical intervention.
11,9,3,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial3,"Patient Presentation  Introduction:  The patient is a 60-year-old male who presented in the emergency department with severe and sudden-onset chest pain radiating to his back. He works as an executive manager and leads a sedentary lifestyle with a long history of cigarette smoking (approximately 30 years and less than 20 cigarettes a day) and occasional alcohol use.   Demographics:   He's a Caucasian male  6'2"""" tall  weighing 190 lbs and lives with his wife and his two adult children in their suburban home.  Past Medical History:  The patient has an established history of high blood pressure  which generally stands uncontrolled due to intermittent compliance with his medication - a combination of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide. He also has a positive diagnosis of atherosclerosis  an unfavorable lipid profile  and early stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He denies having diabetes  neuromuscular disease  or cancer.  Family History:  His father had his first myocardial infarction (MI) at 55 years old m  the second one at 63 and passed away at 70 due to congestive heart failure. His mother is alive and well at 82 but has a history of stroke. His only sibling  an elder brother  has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease.  Clinical Presentation:  Upon checking his vitals  the blood pressure reading was notably different between his two arms - 190/95 in the right and 150/90 in the left  signaling a strong suspicion of aortic dissection. His heart rate was 100 beats per minute. His Su02 was on the lower side at 93%. Physical examination revealed a muffled heart sound without any murmur or fourth heart sound audible.  Diagnostic Evaluation:  Following the initial suspicion  an immediate CT aortography was ordered which confirmed the diagnosis of a Stanford type A aortic dissection  starting from the ascending aorta and extending towards the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.  Treatment Plan:  Immediate surgical consultation was sought. While waiting for the operation  he was started on intravenous beta blockers (Esmolol) for stringent blood pressure control.  The prognosis is guarded considering the high-risk nature of the condition and the surgery. His lifestyle modifications will be critical for his long-term survival and post-surgery recovery. The patient and his family were counselled about his condition and the need for immediate surgery.   Conclusion:  This case reemphasizes the importance of immediate recognition and management of aortic dissection  a life-threatening condition  typically presenting with severe chest pain radiating to the back. The patient's past and family history of cardiovascular disease  together with his lifestyle  likely contributed to the development of aortic dissection."
11,9,4,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial4,Patient Case Presentation - Aortic Dissection   Introduction:   Mr. X  a 65-year-old male  was admitted to the emergency department suffering from severe chest pain that was radiating through his back. His wife reported that her husband's symptoms came on suddenly while he was doing routine yard work. He described this pain as the worst he's ever experienced.  Medical History:   Mr. X has a past medical history significant for hypertension and high cholesterol  for which he is under medication. He has been on Atorvastatin and Lisinopril for approximately 15 years with decent control of both conditions. He has no history of diabetes  kidney diseases  heart diseases  nor history of surgeries. He has been a habitual smoker for the past 20 years  and he usually drinks alcohol socially. There is no record of any drug allergies.  Family History:   There is a strong family history of cardio-vascular diseases as his father had coronary artery disease and his mother had hypertension. His elder brother underwent surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 68.  Presentation and Diagnosis:   Upon examination  the patient displayed signs of distress and was profusively sweating. His BP was found to be 175/110 mmHg  heart rate 98/min and respirations 26/min. An immediate EKG was performed which did not show any signs of myocardial infarction. However  a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest revealed a dissection of the descending thoracic aorta  which extended from the left subclavian artery to the level of the renal arteries. This confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection.  Management and Prognosis:  Mr. X was promptly administered beta-blockers and nitroprusside to reduce blood pressure and relieve the pain. Given the extent of the dissection  he was evaluated for emergent surgery  but the team preferred medical management because the dissection was descending and not involving the ascending aorta. He responded well to the treatment and is currently under close monitoring. Education is ongoing regarding the need to maintain strict blood pressure control and cessation of smoking for better prognosis and reduced risk of recurrence. Given his strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  genetic testing has been suggested.  In conclusion  high suspicion  prompt diagnosis and management are essential in aortic dissection to avoid life-threatening complications. Every effort should be made to identify and modify risk factors to prevent further complications.
11,9,5,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial5,Presenter:   Subject: Mr. Robert Sawyer  a 68-year-old African American male presented with severe chest pain radiating to the back.  Chief Complaint:  Sudden severe chest pain  described as tearing or ripping  and radiating to the back.   HPI:  Mr. Sawyer’s pain began while he was mowing his lawn  it was sudden and severe  causing him to stop what he was doing and sit down. no such previous episodes reported. He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for over 30 years.  Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension for the past 10 years  maintained with Lisinopril. 2. Recurrent pneumonias over the past several years. 3. No known drug allergies.  Family History: 1. Maternal grandfather died of cerebral stroke at age 62. 2. Father died from an aortic aneurysm at age 70.  Social History: Mr. Sawyer is retired and lives with his wife. He worked as a truck driver for 30 years. He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for over 30 years. He occasionally drinks alcohol but denies any illicit drug use.  Clinical Findings: On arrival  his blood pressure was 170/110 mm Hg  pulse 110 bpm  and respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. Physical examination revealed diaphoresis and pallor. Pulses in right arm were diminished compared to the left. Heart sounds were normal with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops.  Investigations: ECG showed no signs of myocardial infarction. A Chest X-ray demonstrated mediastinal widening. Labs including troponins were within normal limits. A CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of descending aortic dissection.  Management: Mr. Sawyer was started on intravenous beta-blockers to lower his blood pressure  as well as pain management medications.   Discussion: The case demonstrates a classic presentation of aortic dissection  a serious life-threatening condition that occurs when the inner layer of the aorta tears. Hypertension is a major risk factor  as seen in Mr. Sawyer's case. Early detection and management are critical to prevent lethal complications. Mr. Sawyer’s smoking history and family history of aortic aneurysm may have further predisposed him to this event.  This case highlights that in a patient presenting with severe chest pain  differential diagnoses beyond myocardial infarction should be considered  especially in light of pertinent medical history and risk factors. 
11,9,6,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial6,Patient Presentation  The patient is Mr. X  a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presents with sudden  severe chest pain radiating to the back. The pain  which began while he was gardening  is described as the worst he has ever experienced.   Past Medical History  Mr. X has had controlled hypertension for a period of 20 years  managed with a regimen of Ramipril and Amlodipine. He has a ten-year history of type II diabetes  managed with Metformin. He is a smoker of 40 years  with a history of 20 pack-years. He also has hyperlipidemia and takes Simvastatin  but has no history of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction.   Family History  Mr. X's father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 58. His mother has a history of hypertension and continues to live well at the age of 82. He had an elder sister who was diagnosed with hypertension and a brother who died in an accident at age 40.  Social History   He is a retired banker  married with two healthy grown-up children. He used to drink alcohol socially but quit ten years ago.  Review of Systems  The patient has no other complaints apart from the chest pain. He reports difficulties in swallowing occasionally. He denies fever  cough  or other symptoms. His bowel movements are regular  and he has no issues with urination. He was previously active but recently has been feeling fatigued.  Physical Examination  Upon arrival at the ER  Mr. X appears pale but not in severe distress. His blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg in the left arm and 145/85 mmHg in the right arm. His heart rate is 110 beats per minute. Lung auscultation reveals normal respiratory sounds. His heart beats are regular with no audible murmurs.  Diagnostic Testing  The ECG did not show signs of myocardial infarction. Blood tests  including Troponin levels  are normal. Chest X-ray shows mediastinal widening. A CT scan of the chest confirms the diagnosis of type B aortic dissection.  Management  Mr. X is admitted to the Cardiovascular Care Unit. He is started on IV beta-blockers to control his blood pressure and heart rate and given analgesics for his pain. A multidisciplinary discussion involving cardiology  cardiothoracic surgery  and vascular surgery is planned to decide if he will require surgical management.  Patient's Condition  Mr. X's pain is well controlled  and he is stable hemodynamically. He is kept under close observation to monitor for changes in his clinical condition.   Informed Consent  The patient was advised of the seriousness of his condition and the potential requirement for surgery. He expressed understanding and offered informed consent for any medical procedure deemed necessary. His family is also involved in treatment discussions. 
11,9,7,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial7,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. K is a 69-year-old Caucasian male presenting with sudden severe chest and upper back pain that radiates to his neck. He describes the pain as """"tearing"""" and reports it began suddenly. His vitals include a blood pressure of 155/90 and pulse rate of 94 bpm  his oxygen saturation is at 97% on room air. The medical history of the patient is significant for hypertension and smoking. He has otherwise been healthy  with no previous surgeries or hospitalizations. The patient's family history is notable for cardiovascular disease: his father passed away in his early 60s from a myocardial infarction.  Evaluation:  On general examination  the patient appears distressed due to pain. Initial cardiac workup including an electrocardiogram and chest x-ray are performed. The electrocardiogram shows no sign of ischemia  and the chest x-ray is reported as potentially suggestive of a widened mediastinum  which indicates the possibility of an aortic dissection. Other lab work such as CBC  renal function tests  and coagulation profiles are ordered  and all fall within normal limits.  The patient is rushed to the Radiology for a CT aortogram that confirms the diagnosis of a Stanford Type A aortic dissection that starts just above the aortic valve and extends up to the left common carotid artery. Given elevated blood pressure and confirmed diagnosis  Mr. K is immediately started on IV esmolol to control his blood pressure and heart rate.  Treatment and Prognosis:  The patient is urgently referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon for emergent surgical repair as medical therapy alone is insufficient due to the involvement of the ascending aorta  which has a high risk of rupture. Following successful surgery and a period of recovery  the patient will need close follow-up with cardiology as well as aggressive blood pressure and heart rate control to minimize the risk of future dissections. He will also be counseled on lifestyle modifications and smoking cessation.  This case highlights the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of aortic dissection  the urgency of which is often likened to that of a """"surgical emergency"""". Despite Mr. K's otherwise good health  his risk factors of advanced age  hypertension  smoking  and family history of cardiovascular disease  unfortunately  put him at a heightened risk for this life-threatening condition."
11,9,8,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial8,Patient Profile:  The subject of our case study is Mr. Harrison  a 60-year-old Caucasian man who is a resident of St. Louis  Missouri where he lives with his wife. He is a retired mechanical engineer and a non-smoker but confesses to moderate alcohol consumption. He is six feet tall  weighs 215 lbs  and leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Harrison was presented to the emergency department following immediate sharp  severe chest pain in the early hours of the morning  radiating towards back along with shortness of breath and profuse sweating. His wife noted that he appeared pale  anxious and had complained of feeling unwell the entire day before.  Medical History:  Mr. Harrison has a known history of hypertension  high cholesterol level and diabetes type II for which he was prescribed Metformin and was on a diet control plan. His last recorded blood pressure during a clinic visit two months ago was high at 155/95 mm of Hg  and the cholesterol level was also borderline high.  Family History:  His father suffered from an acute myocardial infarction and died at the age of 56. His mother is alive and well at 85  with no significant illness  but his younger brother  now 57 years of age  has hypertension and high cholesterol.  Clinical Examination and Diagnosis:  On examination  his blood pressure was raised; there was a difference in the bilateral upper limb blood pressure. ECG showed no acute ischemic changes. The patient was immediately subjected to Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) and it highlighted an intimal flap and a false lumen  leading to the diagnosis of aortic dissection. The Stanford classification on viewing the images categorized the dissection as Type A  affecting both the ascending and descending aorta.  Following diagnosis  the patient was referred to specialized medical staff to further his treatment process. He was initiated on antihypertensive medication and surgical consultation was sought regarding an aortic repair surgery. Succeeding treatment was planned with strict control of hypertension to prevent extension of the dissection. The patient's family was informed  counseled about the seriousness of the condition and provided with adequate reassurance.  This case reiterates the importance of maintaining control of chronic conditions such as hypertension and high cholesterol to prevent life-threatening complications like aortic dissection. Given the family history of early cardiac events and the fact that the patient himself has several risk factors  genetic counseling and testing might also be worth considering.  Endnote: This case emphasizes the importance of prompt recognition  diagnosis  and management of aortic dissection which is a critical and life-threatening cardiovascular emergency.
11,9,9,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial9,"Patient’s Profile: Mr. S  a 63-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the emergency department due to complaints of severe chest pain.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. S reported experiencing intense  """"tearing"""" chest pain which had started approximately four hours prior to his visit. He clarified that the pain began unexpectedly at rest  rating it as 9/10 at its peak.  Past Medical History: The patient has been hypertensive for 10 years and has been on medication  albeit irregularly. He also has a 20-year history of smoking  although he quit five years ago. There is no known history of diabetes  renal disease  or pulmonary disease.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  Mr. S was found to have elevated blood pressure (170/100 mmHg). He was in visible discomfort  sweating profusely  and had unequal pulses in his upper extremities. His abdomen was mildly distended  and he reported tenderness in the abdominal area. Lung sounds were clear on auscultation.   Investigations: An immediate CT angiography was performed  which confirmed an aortic dissection originating from a few centimeters above the aortic valve extending to the level of the renal arteries. His laboratory results showed elevated D-dimer levels  an essential biomarker indicating aortic dissection.   Family History: The patient reports that his father died of a stroke at the age of 65  and his mother had a myocardial infarction at 70. He has a one older brother who is healthy.  Social and Personal History: Mr. S is a retired engineer who lives with his wife. He reports that he has been leading a sedentary lifestyle since retirement.

11,9,10,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial10,Patient Presentation:  Our patient  Mr. Samuel Rodgers  is a 65-year-old African-American male presenting with severe chest and back pain  which he characterizes as tearing and radiating from the chest to the back. The pain came about abruptly while he was at home watching television. He additionally reports experiencing shortness of breath  sweating  and palpitations. Mr. Rodgers has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. He is moderately overweight  with a BMI of 28. He reports using antihypertensive drugs and metformin inconsistently due to forgetfulness.  His father passed at the age of 61 due to a stroke while his mother  aged 86  is living with heart disease. One of his elder brothers  aged 70  had an aortic aneurysm a few years ago.  Physical Examination Findings:  On assessment  his blood pressure was found to be significantly higher (190/110 mmHg)  and he has a fast heart rate (115 beats per minute). An abdominal examination revealed no abnormalities  but an elevated jugular venous pressure was observed. His urine tested positive for microalbuminuria. His neurological examination was normal.   Clinical Course:  Based upon the presenting symptomatology  an ECG and a chest X-ray were performed initially  which showed no abnormalities. However  the enduring high suspicion led to performing a computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan  which confirmed the diagnosis of Stanford type A aortic dissection  revealing an intimal flap with a false lumen in the ascending aorta.  Following the diagnosis  Mr. Rodgers was promptly referred to the cardiovascular surgery team for an emergency surgery. Beta blockers were administered to control blood pressure and heart rate. Following successful surgery  the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.   Conclusion and Plan:  In the future  Mr. Rodgers needs more judicious management of his hypertension and diabetes. A fruitful discussion with him about the importance of compliance with medications was conducted. Regular outpatient follow-up appointments and monitoring are arranged. Lifestyle modifications  including a balanced diet  regular exercise  and cessation of alcohol  are advised for Mr. Rodgers to manage his weight and overall health status.
11,9,11,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial11,Patient Presentation:  Name: John Doe Age: 65 Sex: Male Occupation: Retired Mechanical Engineer  Chief Complaint: Severe chest pain radiating to back  Past Medical History: John is a known hypertensive for the past 15 years. He also has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus.   Family History: His father died in his early 70s due to myocardial infarction.  Present Illness: John presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of severe chest pain  which radiated to his back. The pain started while he was gardening and was described as sharp and tearing. It was not relieved by rest.  Physical Examination: Upon assessment in the ED  he was found to be in distress  with a blood pressure reading of 170/110 mm Hg and a heart rate of 105 beats per minute. There was a discrepancy in blood pressure measurements between the right and left arm  with the left arm displaying lower readings. Cardiac auscultation revealed an early diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border  indicating aortic regurgitation.  Lab Tests: His initial lab results showed increased levels of D-dimer. The ECG was normal.  Diagnostic Tests: A transesophageal echocardiography was conducted revealing a dissection beginning in the ascending aorta and extending to the iliac arteries. The diagnosis of Type A aortic dissection was made.  Treatment Plan: The Emergency management was initiated with blood pressure control using intravenous beta-blockers and vasodilators. He was then directly transported to the cardiothoracic surgery for emergent surgical repair of the aorta.  Discussion: John's longstanding uncontrolled hypertension is a risk factor for aortic dissection. The early diastolic murmur suggests aortic regurgitation  which is a complication of ascending aortic dissections due to impairment of the aortic valve function. The discrepancy in blood pressure between the two arms can be a clue for aortic dissection. D-dimer can be elevated in patients with aortic dissection  though it is not specific. An ECG is often normal in aortic dissection  as this condition does not typically cause myocardial ischemia. The definitive diagnosis of aortic dissection is made by imaging  with transesophageal echocardiography being highly sensitive.
11,9,12,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial12,Patient Information: Mr. J is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who has been previously healthy and active within his community. He works at a local hardware store and lives with his wife of 40 years. They have three adult children. Mr. J has a family history of heart disease  with both his father and older brother suffering from cardiac-related incidents in their 60s  although no one in his immediate family has been diagnosed with aortic dislocation before.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. J presented to the emergency department with a sudden severe pain in the center of his chest  which he stated has been radiating to his back between the shoulder blades. He described the pain as like “being stabbed ” which worsened when he tried to move or breathe deeply. Additionally  he reported feeling light-headed and experiencing extreme episodes of sweating.  Past Medical History: Mr. J has a past history of untreated hypertension. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially. He has no known allergies and is on no regular medications  not even for hypertension. No history of recreational drug use was noted.  Physical Examination: On observation  Mr. J appeared distressed and was perspiring profusely. His blood pressure was found to be elevated (170/110 mmHg). He had a regular pulse of 90 bpm. His lungs were clear  and his abdomen examination was normal.  Investigations: An ECG showed no acute changes. The chest X-ray findings suggested a widened mediastinum and an abnormal aortic contour. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis of a descending aortic dissection. Blood tests  including full blood count  renal function  and cardiac enzymes  were also performed.  Discussion: Aortic dissection occurs when the wall of the aorta ruptures  allowing blood to flow into the wall  splitting the layers apart. Risk factors include hypertension  genetic conditions leading to a weakened or enlarged aorta  and atherosclerosis. Mr. J's untreated hypertension and family history of heart disease have contributed to this health event.  Treatment Plan: The management of aortic dissection could be either medical or surgical depending on the type of the dissection. In Mr. J's case  as he has a type B dissection (starts after the aortic arch)  the approach will typically be initially medical (medications to lower heart rate and blood pressure) unless there are complications such as rupture or malperfusion. His pain control is also important to manage.   Patient and Family Education: Patient and family education is crucial. Mr. J needs to understand the importance of managing his blood pressure to prevent further complications. He will need to understand the mooted path of treatment along with its aims  and the possible side effects and complications. The family can support Mr. J in understanding this information as well as contribute to the success of lifestyle changes  such as a low sodium diet and regular doctor’s appointments.
11,9,13,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial13,"Patient Introduction Our patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. X  who was admitted to the emergency department following a complaint of severe chest pains which he described as """"tearing"""" in nature  radiating to the back  and sudden onset.  Past Medical History The patient has a ten-year history of uncontrolled hypertension. Records indicate an average blood pressure reading of 160/95 mmHg during the annual check-up for the last five years despite being on amlodipine. He is an active smoker with a 30-pack-per-year history. His body mass index is 29  classified as overweight. He also has an intermittent history of high cholesterol. He does not have any history of diabetes  cancer or any surgeries.  Family History Mr. X's father passed away after a stroke at the age of 60  but also dealt with untreated hypertension. His mother is alive and healthy at 80 years old  with no history of cardiovascular diseases; however  she was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.   Presenting Complaint + Investigations Mr. X's pain improved minimally with nitroglycerin  prompting further investigation. An EKG was carried out  which showed no evidence of ischemic changes. Lab results revealed normal troponin levels  blood sugar  and other serum biochemical parameters. His chest X-ray showed a widened mediastinum  which raised suspicion for thoracic aortic aneurysm. Further investigation with a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest confirmed an acute Stanford type A aortic dissection starting just above the sinus of Valsalva and extending up to the left common carotid artery.  Discussion The critical findings in this patient represent a Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm that eventually resulted in Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection  highly likely resulting from his underlying untreated hypertension and tobacco use. The case outlines the importance of hypertension management and lifestyle modifications to prevent catastrophic conditions such as aortic dissection.  Management Following the diagnosis  Mr. X was immediately referred to cardio-thoracic surgery for emergency surgical repair of the dissecting aortic aneurysm  along with management of his hypertension.   In conclusion  this case clearly demonstrates the importance of controlling classic modifiable risk factors such as hypertension  applying life-style modifications such as weight management  cessation of smoking  and regular monitoring cholesterol levels in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases."
11,9,14,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial14,Patient Presentation:   Mr. L  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  has been admitted to the emergency department  complaining of sudden severe chest pain which he describes as “tearing” in nature. The patient reports a history of hypertension  for which he has been prescribed beta-blockers but remains inconsistent in taking the medication. He was a smoker for 40 years and quit 3 years ago. Apart from this  he denies any other significant history of cardiovascular disease.   Complete Demographics:   He hails from a suburban environment and is a retired public servant. He has regular alcohol consumption  typically two beers per day. He's married with two adult children  living with his wife.   Past Medical History:   Patient's major medical diagnosis so far emphasizes largely on hypertension. Despite advice to maintain a healthier lifestyle  he lives rather a sedentary lifestyle and admits to consuming high sodium diet and irregular medication. He does not have any history of diabetes or other endocrine disorders. Previously  he underwent surgery for appendicitis in his 20s.   Family History:  His father passed away at the age of 75 due to myocardial infarction and mother passed away at the age of 80 due to a stroke  which suggests a genetic predisposition to cardiovascular diseases. He has one older brother who is alive and diagnosed with high cholesterol and hypertension.  Physical Examination:   On physical examination  his blood pressure was found to be significantly different in two arms. His Heart rate is elevated. There were no remarkable changes in the rest of the physical examination. A quick CT angiogram then confirms the diagnosis of aortic dissection.   Conclusion:  Considering his past medical history of poorly controlled hypertension  older age  and the significant family history of cardiovascular diseases  the patient was at high risk for aortic dissection. The necessity to educate the patient about the importance of managing his hypertension and adhering to a healthier lifestyle could not be overstated. Currently  he has been scheduled for emergency surgery for the aortic dissection  and his family has been informed. After successful surgery  a permanent lifestyle change with focus on salt restricted diet  exercise  and consistent antihypertensive medication usage was recommended.
11,9,15,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial15,Patient Introduction:   Mr. John Meyer  a 56-year-old African American male  presented to the Emergency Department with sudden severe chest pain that radiated to his back. Mr. Meyer  who works as a school principal  has recently been under a lot of stress. He is a non-smoker  and he does not consume alcohol. He was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago  for which he has been taking medication regularly.   Medical History:   Mr. Meyer’s medical history indicates that besides hypertension  he is also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus. His hypertension has been relatively well controlled over the years with the use of ACE inhibitors. His blood glucose levels have stabilized with the aid of Metformin. He doesn't report any history of surgeries  and he has never had any allergies that were known.  Family History:   His father died in his early 50s due to a myocardial infarction  and his mother passed away in her late 40s due to a stroke. His family history also has instances of diabetes  hypertension  and cardiac issues.  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Meyer complained of a sharp  sudden onset chest pain that started about two hours before presenting at the Emergency Department. The pain was described as 'tearing' in nature and radiated to his back. He also complained of shortness of breath  weakness  and dizziness.  Physical Examination and Investigations:  Upon examination  his BP was found to be 180/110 in the right arm with a heart rate of 100 bpm. He had a bit of a disparity in blood pressure readings between his arms. Heart sounds were normal with no visible signs of heart failure. He underwent an immediate CT angiography which confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection.   Plan/Intervention:  As per standard management guidelines  Mr. Meyer was given intravenous beta-blockers to reduce his heart rate and blood pressure. He was further managed with pain control to reduce analgesic requirements and manage his discomfort. He has been referred for emergency surgery consultation for a possible aortic replacement or stenting. He will also need to undergo lifestyle and medication adjustment consultations to manage his hypertension  cholesterol  and diabetes to reduce future cardiac risk.  In this case  the patient's age  race  stress levels  and history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes significantly contributed to his risk factor for developing an aortic dissection. His family history of early deaths due to cardiovascular diseases also placed him at a higher risk. The sudden 'tearing' chest pain radiating to the back was a classic symptom of aortic dissection. The management was targeted at stabilizing his vitals before heading for a more definitive treatment with surgery. The important lesson in this case was to never ignore these classic symptoms and to act promptly and efficiently.   Considering Mr. Meyer's medical history and the current diagnosis  it's highly recommended that he periodically checks in with his GP or a cardiologist to ensure optimal maintenance of his health status. He will also need nutritional and lifestyle management counseling.

Patient History:  Past medical history of the patient includes hypertension for 20 years  controlled with anti-hypertensives (Losartan/Hydrochlorothiazide)  hyperlipidemia for which he takes statins  and a history of smoking about a pack a day for the past 30 years. Additionally  the patient underwent an appendectomy at age 16  but denies any other surgeries or hospitalizations. He denies any allergies. His medications include Losartan/Hydrochlorothiazide  statins  and a low-dose aspirin.  Family History:  Family history reveals that the patient's father died of a myocardial infarction at age 71 and his mother had a history of stroke. He has two brothers both have hypertension. One younger sister with no known prior medical conditions. No family history of aortic diseases.  Social History:  The patient is married  retired from a desk job  and lives with his wife. He has smoked a pack a day for last 30 years and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has never used recreational drugs.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  pulse was 110 beats per minute. Blood pressure in the right arm was noted to be significantly higher than in the left arm. Physical examination was notable for diaphoresis and distress due to pain.  Investigations:  Electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST changes. A CT Angiogram was ordered  which reveled a dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending downward.  Diagnosis:  Based [on his symptoms  medical history  family history  clinical examination and diagnostic results] he was diagnosed with a type A aortic dissection.  Management and Follow up:  The patient was immediately started on beta-blockers to control hypertension and heart rate  after which he was transferred for emergency surgery. The surgery was successful  and patient was discharged a week later with follow up and rehabilitation planned.   (Clarity regarding the patient and the severity of the condition have enabled early detection and treatment intervention. This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough history and physical in assessing patients with chest pain.)
11,9,17,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial17,"Patient Information:  A 67-year-old African-American male  retired engineer.  Chief Complaint:  Sudden onset of severe chest pain  radiating to his back.  Present History: The patient reports the pain began while he was gardening. It started suddenly and was severe enough to make him stop gardening and lay down. He states that it felt like a """"tearing sensation"""" that spread toward his back. His wife immediately called 911 and the patient was transported to the hospital. The patient also reports symptoms of light-headedness and nausea.  Past Medical History: Hypertension for seven years  managed with Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide. History of smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years; quit 10 years ago.  Family History: Father passed away at age 72 from heart failure; mother now 88 years old is living with type II diabetes and hypertension. The patient has one younger brother at 59 diagnosed with hypertension.  Examination: Bilateral blood pressure readings were notable for a 20 mmHg difference. On auscultation  a faint diastolic murmur was heard. Coldness was noted on the lower extremities. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Testing: CT Scan of the chest with contrast showed aortic dissection starting from the ascending aorta and extending to the abdominal aorta.  Hospital Course: The patient was urgently transferred for cardiothoracic surgery consultation. The surgery to repair the aortic dissection was successful. Postoperatively  he was managed in the cardiovascular ICU  stepped down to the ward and subsequently discharged home in stable condition on postoperative day 9.   Conclusion: This patient's sudden severe chest pain coupled with his personal history of hypertension and family history of cardiovascular disease made aortic dissection a top differential diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) was able to confirm the presence of an aortic dissection and guide management  which involved emergent referral to cardiothoracic surgery. The patient’s hospital course was significant for successful surgical management  with the patient successfully discharged in stable condition.  Future Considerations: The patient would certainly benefit from aggressive blood pressure control. Adaptations in lifestyle such as regular exercise  dietary modifications  regular follow-ups  and adherence to medication form part of the management plan to minimize future cardiovascular incidents. Genetic counselling  if feasible  can be sought considering the family history of cardiovascular ailments.    "
11,9,18,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial18,Case Presentation   Patient Profile: Mr. Johnson is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who has presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain. He has a well-documented past medical history  which includes uncontrolled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  a smoking history of 20 pack-years  and a family history of cardiovascular diseases including his father who passed away at an early age due to an aortic dissection.  History of Present Illness: Mr. Johnson presented complaining of a sudden tearing sensation in the middle of his chest that started several hours ago without any provocation. The pain extended back towards his interscapular area. He describes the pain as severe and unlike anything he has experienced before. He has noticed feeling lightheaded  but denied any nausea or vomiting.  Emergency Department Course and Management: Upon initial physical examination  Mr. Johnson was noted to appear extremely anxious and in significant distress. His initial blood pressure was noted to be elevated at 200/110 mmHg. The cardiovascular examination revealed a faint diastolic murmur and discrepancy in blood pressure between the upper limbs. Due to high suspicion  a computed tomography (CT) scan was requested and revealed an ascending aortic dissection.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation and the CT scan results  a diagnosis of a Type A aortic dissection was made.  Management & Treatment: Given the emergent nature and the high mortality rate with Type A aortal dissection  Mr. Johnson was promptly started on intravenous blood pressure-lowering medication and was scheduled for emergent surgical intervention. The course of treatment consisted of an ascending aortic and hemiarch replacement with placement of a composite mechanical aortic valve graft.  Post Surgery follow-up: Following surgery  Mr. Johnson was closely monitored for any postsurgical complications in a high dependency setting for several days. He tolerated the procedure well and was progressively weaned off pain management and blood pressure-lowering medication.  Outpatient follow-up plan: A follow-up plan was established for Mr. Johnson whereby he was advised on lifestyle modifications  smoking cessation  and strict blood pressure control. His state will be closely monitored by the cardiovascular team and necessary adjustments to his medication will be made as required. Patient was counselled about taking lifelong anticoagulation therapy due to placement of the mechanical valve and regular follow-ups were planned for anticoagulation monitoring.  This case underscores the importance of early recognition and prompt management of Type A aortic dissection considering its high mortality rate. Specific attention towards effective hypertensive control management  lifestyle changes  and establishing a robust follow-up care system are crucial in safeguarding the long-term health of the patient.
11,9,19,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial19,Patient Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection  Patient Information:  Mr. James  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented himself to the emergency department in profound distress. He works as a real estate agent and lives with his wife. He is a former smoker  having quit ten years ago  and consumes alcohol moderately. The patient has a medical history of controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He reports having a sedentary lifestyle due to the nature of his work. His father died of an aneurysm at age 75 and his mother of breast cancer at age 78. Mr. James has two sisters  both of whom are healthy.  Presenting Issues: The patient arrived complaining of severe  sudden-onset chest pain that seemed to be radiating to his back. He described it as a sharp  tearing sensation. Along with severe pain  he reported lightheadedness and shortness of breath. His blood pressure upon admission was 170/110 mmHg  with a pulse of 110 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.  Diagnostic Findings: An urgent CT angiogram was performed  which revealed a type B aortic dissection stretching from the descending aorta to the iliac arteries. His blood workup was unremarkable  aside from a slightly elevated D-dimer level. EKG showed no signs of ischemia or infarction.  Treatment: Upon confirmation of his diagnosis  Mr. James was immediately started on antihypertensive therapy with intravenous labetalol to control his blood pressure and HR with a targeted systolic pressure of 100-120 mmHg. Pain was managed with intravenous morphine. Cardiothoracic surgical consultation was urgently sourced  who advised that in this non-emergent case  conservative medical management focusing on strict blood pressure control was most appropriate. Hence  Mr. James received appropriate antihypertensive therapy and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring.  Prognosis: His prognosis is guarded  as the 30-day mortality rate from initial detection ranges widely  from 10% for medically managed cases to 30% following surgical intervention. Ensuring Mr. James adheres to a strict regimen of blood pressure control medication will be critical to preventing future complications.   Follow-up: Mr. James was discharged with a recommendation of close surveillance through imaging at 1  3  6  and 12 months post-discharge. He was advised to maintain a healthy diet  start an exercise regimen  and regularly monitor his blood pressure. In case of any recurrence of pain  breathlessness  or other new symptoms  he was instructed to contact the hospital immediately. Regular cardiology and primary care appointments were made for ongoing hypertension and hyperlipidemia management.   This case serves as a reminder that aortic dissection can be a fatal condition if not diagnosed early and managed promptly. It underscores the importance of monitoring blood pressure continually in hypertensive patients and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients presenting with acute chest pain. 
11,9,20,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial20,Patient Presentation:   Ms. J.S is a 65-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for hypertension. She also has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. She presents to the emergency department with sudden  severe chest pain radiating to her back  associated with shortness of breath and fatigue.  Medical History:  Ms. J.S has been non-compliant with her hypertensive medications for the past few months and has not been monitoring her blood glucose levels regularly. She had her last lipid profile taken one year ago  which showed elevated cholesterol and LDL levels. She has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a 15-year history of hypertension. She is known to be a smoker for the past 25 years with an average of one pack a day.  Family History:  She has a family history of cardiovascular diseases; her father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 55  and her elder brother had a stroke two years ago.  Physical Exam:  On physical examination  She had a blood pressure reading of 160/90 mmHg in her right arm and 145/88 mmHg in her left arm. Her heart rate was irregular at 110 beats per minute. She appeared pale and looked acutely sick.   Working Diagnosis:  Given the sudden onset of severe chest pain  blood pressure difference between arms  and her medical history  a provisional diagnosis of aortic dissection was made.   Investigations and Hospital Course:  An immediate chest radiograph revealed a widened mediastinum and a CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of a Type B aortic dissection extending from the left subclavian artery to the renal arteries. She was admitted to ICU for close observation and blood pressure control.  Management Plan:  Due to her unstable condition and acute chest pain  she was started on pain control medication and antihypertensive therapy. Since her dissection involved the thoracic aorta  she was treated medically with beta-blockers to slow her heart rate and lower her blood pressure.   Outpatient Follow-up:  She will need close outpatient following up after her discharge. She will need immediate lifestyle modifications  including a low-fat diet  cessation of smoking  and control of her diabetes and hypertension  which are major risk factors for aortic dissection.   This case emphasizes the importance of managing chronic conditions such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia  particularly in the setting of a strong family history of cardiovascular diseases  and draws attention to the dangers of non-compliance with medications.
11,9,21,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial21,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 72-year-old Caucasian male  who presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain which he described as """"tearing"""" in nature. The pain was mainly in the anterior chest  radiating to the back. He also had shortness of breath and reported feeling faint  although he had no history of any symptoms related to heart disease in the past.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of long-standing hypertension for which he is being treated with a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Although his blood pressure was well-controlled  the last recorded reading was significantly elevated (165/100 mmHg). He also had Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  with an HbA1c of 7.8  which was being managed with oral hypoglycemic drugs.   Demographics:  The patient is a retired mechanic who lives with his wife. He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 50 years. He consumes moderate alcohol in social gatherings. He has a body-mass index of 28 indicating that he is overweight.  Family History:  His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 65. His mother lived until she was 80 and died of complications related to diabetes. The patient has a brother who has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease. There's no history of aortic disease in the family.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  his pulse was 110 bpm and irregular  and blood pressure was 170/105 mmHg. The physical examination revealed a slight difference in blood pressure between his right and left arms. No obvious pulse delay was noted. Breath sounds were clear bilaterally  and heart sounds were normal without any appreciable murmur.   Investigations and Diagnosis:  Given his symptoms and the history  aortic dissection was suspected. The subsequent CT angiogram confirmed an ascending aortic dissection which extended from the root to the iliac arteries.   Discussion:  This is a classic presentation of aortic dissection  which is a life-threatening condition that needs immediate attention. The patient's longstanding  poorly controlled hypertension makes him at high risk for this condition  and his history of smoking also puts him at risk for arterial damage. With his ascending aortic involvement  he is in Stanford type A category  which implies that he needs urgent surgical intervention. Although aortic dissection can be genetic  this seems unlikely in the absence of any family history of aortic disease.  This case emphasizes the expansiveness of the differential diagnosis for chest pain  and the role of a detailed history and high index of suspicion for the diagnosis of potentially life-threatening conditions."
11,9,22,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial22,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the Emergency Department with sudden severe chest pain radiating to the back. He indicated that the pain was sharp and tearing in nature  and initially  it was concentrated on the front of the chest but gradually moved to the back.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension for the past 15 years  regularly controlled with beta-blockers. He has also been detected with moderate atherosclerosis 5 years back. He is a non-diabetic and a reformed smoker  having quit smoking 10 years ago. He undergoes routine physical examinations and tests annually  all of which have been fairly normal so far.  Family History:  His father passed away at the age of 70 due to a myocardial infarction  and his mother died at 75 due to stroke. His younger brother has hypertension and diabetes. He has two sons who are healthy.  Presenting Complaints:  On examination  he had a blood pressure reading of 180/100 mmHg and pulse rate of 110 beats per minute. The cardiovascular system examination revealed diastolic murmur. ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy. Other systems were within normal limits.  Investigations:  Imaging studies done using a CT angiogram confirmed the presence of aortic dissection involving the ascending and descending aorta (Type A dissection). Laboratory findings showed elevated D-dimer levels.  Management:  Mr. Doe was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to decrease his blood pressure and heart rate and was prepared for emergency surgery.   Postoperative Period:  Postoperatively  Mr. Doe showed a significant improvement in symptoms. He will be followed up in the outpatient department for regular monitoring and management of his hypertension and atherosclerosis. He has been advised lifestyle modifications including a low salt diet  regular aerobic exercises  and stress management techniques.   This case emphasizes the typical presentation of aortic dissection and the importance of early diagnosis and management  especially in patients with hypertension and atherosclerosis.   This case has also highlighted the importance of individual risk factor assessment  early and aggressive antihypertensive therapy  and close follow-up in preventing severe and potentially fatal complications in patients with aortic dissection.

Social History: He is a retired engineer  widowed  with two adult children living out of state. He does not drink alcohol  but admits to occasional cigar smoking during social events.   Clinical Presentation: On physical examination  he appeared distressed and diaphoretic. His blood pressure upon arrival was 190/110 mmHg  pulse rate 100/min  and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Heart sounds were normal without murmur  rub or gallop. There was no evidence of Marfan Syndrome externally. The rest of his examination was unremarkable.  Investigations: The EKG showed left ventricle hypertrophy but no ischemic changes. Labs showed slightly elevated troponins  and kidney function tests suggesting reduced renal function. D-dimer was also elevated. Chest X-ray indicated widened mediastinum.  The diagnosis was confirmed by performing a CT angiogram of the chest  which showed an intimal flap in the ascending aorta consistent with Stanford type A aortic dissection.  Treatment: The patient was immediately started on IV beta-blockers to lower his heart rate and blood pressure. Vascular surgeons were consulted and  considering his medical history and the type of dissection  emergency surgical repair was planned  which was successful.  This case highlights the need for a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients presenting with severe chest pain and a history of hypertension. It also emphasizes the importance of aggressive blood pressure control in patients with known history of hypertension.
11,9,24,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial24,Patient Presentation: Mr. J  a 65-year-old  male  African-American patient with a diagnosis of aortic dissection was admitted to our health facility. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes which have been under control with the help of an ACE inhibitor and Metformin consecutively. In his family medical history  both his father and older brother had cardiovascular diseases that occurred at a relatively early age.   Mr. J presents with sudden  severe chest pain radiating to his back. He describes the pain as a tearing or ripping sensation. Upon evaluation  his vital signs include a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg  pulse rate of 90 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 92% while breathing ambient air. A systolic ejection murmur was noted upon cardiac examination. His body mass index (BMI) is within the overweight category and does not exercise regularly. The patient does not smoke  but he does consume alcohol occasionally.   Based on his presenting symptoms  past medical history of hypertension and diabetes  family history of cardiovascular disease  the primary diagnosis is Stanford Type A aortic dissection.   A CT angiogram was immediately scheduled which revealed an intimal flap in the ascending aorta  confirming the diagnosis of aortic dissection. His blood tests were also remarkable for high serum glucose  indicating suboptimal control of diabetes.  The management plan includes immediate medical stabilization with for instance  IV beta blockers to reduce blood pressure and heart rate  and to prepare the patient for possible surgical intervention. Given the risk of complications  the patient's family has been engaged in discussions about the care plan and prognosis.   This case underscores the urgency in identifying and promptly managing aortic dissection  especially in patients with risk factors like uncontrolled hypertension  diabetes  and a positive family history of cardiovascular diseases. Regular follow ups  lifestyle modifications  and stringent control of blood pressure and blood sugars are vital in managing such patients.
11,9,25,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial25,Patient Case Presentation:   Patient Information: Mr. B is a 68-year-old man  weighing around 90kgs  living in Nevada. He is of Caucasian descent and retired as an accountant about 5 years ago. Mr. B is married with two sons. Due to his work nature  he has led a sedentary lifestyle and has a history of unhealthy eating habits. He does not smoke or consume alcohol regularly.   Presenting Symptoms: Mr. B was brought to the Emergency department with sudden  severe back pain that started about three hours ago. The pain was described as tearing and radiating to his chest. He also reported episodic sweating  mild nausea  and shortness of breath.   Past Medical History: Mr. B was previously diagnosed with hypertension twenty years ago  which has been consistently managed with anti-hypertensives. Other medical history involves controlled Type II diabetes and a minor stroke five years ago. He has no known drug allergies.  Family History: His father passed away at 60 due to a heart attack  and his mother lived until 85 and died of old age. One of his brothers  now 71  had a heart bypass surgery at 55.   Clinical Findings: On physical examination  his blood pressure reading was noted to be 200/120 mmHg on the right arm and 180/100 mmHg on the left. The patient had an irregular pulse of 110 beats per minute. Auscultation of the chest revealed a harsh systolic murmur along the right sternal border. Chest X-ray revealed mediastinal widening  and the initial EKG showed evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.  Diagnosis: Considering the presenting symptoms  clinical findings  and medical history  the patient was diagnosed with an acute aortic dissection.  Management Plan: Mr. B was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers to regulate his heart rate and blood pressure. The thoracic surgeon was notified  and emergent surgical intervention was planned. Prophylactic antibiotics initiated.  Discussion: Aortic dissection is a high mortality condition  often misdiagnosed due to its varied presentations. Mr. B's hypertension could be the significant contributing factor to his condition. The disparity in blood pressure between both arms and chest pain hint towards the diagnosis. Aggressive blood pressure management is vital along with surgical intervention for type A dissections.  It is crucial to involve family members in the decision-making process and guide them about necessary lifestyle changes to minimize future health risks due to chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes. Regular follow-up and monitoring can go a long way in early intervention in such life-threatening conditions.
11,9,26,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial26,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male  named J.B.  who presented with severe chest pain radiating to the back  palpitations  shortness of breath  and diaphoresis. His appearance is consistent with his stated age  and he was visibly in distress. His vitals were stable  but his blood pressure readings were significantly discrepant between the right and left upper extremities.   Past Medical History: J.B. has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  with lackluster compliance towards medication. He also has been a heavy smoker for about 30 years. J.B. previously had an event of myocardial infarction  approximately five years ago. He also has a history of chronic renal disease. No known allergies from medications were recorded.  Family History: Family history is significant  with his father succumbing to a stroke at the age of 70 and his mother having suffered from chronic hypertension and diabetes. His younger brother had a recent diagnosis of aortic aneurysm.   Current Presentation: J.B's pain onset was sudden  and he states it as the worst pain he has ever felt. Furthering concerns  an electrocardiogram displayed nonspecific ST changes  and chest X-ray indicated mediastinal widening. A CT angiogram confirmed observation suspicions and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made.  Management: He was immediately started on beta-blockers to maintain heart rate and blood pressure. Due to the acuteness and likely progression of the dissection  surgical intervention was recommended.   The importance of regular follow-up and compliance with medication was thoroughly explained to the patient. Smoking cessation was also emphasized  given J.B’s considerable smoking history and role it could have played in developing his condition.   In this case  the diagnosis of aortic dissection was suspected based on the patient's presentation  characteristic symptoms  and significant risk factors - hypertension  smoking  and family history of aortic aneurysm. Prompt diagnosis is critical given the high mortality rate associated with untreated aortic dissection. This patient's case shows the importance of maintaining a broad differential in patients with chest pain and the significance of immediate intervention in cases of aortic dissection.
11,9,27,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial27,Patient Presentation  Mr. T  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  was presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe chest pain. The pain was described as sharp  radiating to his back  and 10/10 in severity. The patient has a past medical history of untreated hypertension  smoking (30 pack years)  and occasional alcohol use. He denies a family history of cardiovascular diseases  though his father passed away from lung cancer at the age of 67.  Mr. T first noticed the pain after carrying a heavy bag of groceries upstairs. Bon his arrival  his vitals read as follows: blood pressure 200/110 mmHg  pulse rate 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute  temperature 98.6 F  Oxygen saturation 92% on room air.  Physical examination found his left carotid pulse to be weaker than the right. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. His heart had an irregular rhythm  no murmur or gallops. The patient was alert and oriented but in obvious distress.  Diagnostic Assessment  ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy. An immediate chest x-ray was obtained that showed the mediastinum was widened. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the presence of a dissecting aorta  beginning just above the aortic valve and extending to the renal arteries  which is consistent with Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection.  Therapeutic Intervention  Given the type and location of dissection  the patient required urgent surgical intervention. Meanwhile  he was started on IV esmolol to lower his heart rate and blood pressure. He was then transferred to a tertiary care center for emergency surgery.  Discussion  Mr. T represents a classic case of aortic dissection  with several high-risk factors including hypertension and smoking. His severe  sharp chest pain suggested significant cardiovascular complications  with radiography and CTA findings confirming aortic dissection.  Due to the acute nature of his condition  a swift diagnosis was critical. Initial management aimed to stabilize the patient  and the involvement of a surgical team to discuss the feasibility of immediate surgical intervention.  The case illustrates the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients presenting with severe chest pain  particularly in those with known predisposing conditions like hypertension. Prompt identification and intervention can significantly decrease morbidity and mortality associated with this life-threatening condition.
11,9,28,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial28,"Patient Presentation  Patient's Identification Mr. Gray is a 57-year-old African-American male  living in Springfield with his wife. He works as a financial analyst and is a current smoker  with a 20 pack-year history. Mr. Gray is not a known alcoholic but drinks occasionally.   Present Illness Mr. Gray came to the ER with a complaint of sudden  severe chest pain radiating from the front of his chest to his back  described as a 'tearing' sensation. He stated the pain started suddenly around 2 hours ago  while he was out gardening. His vital signs revealed uncontrolled hypertension with a systolic blood pressure of 185 mmHg.  Past Medical History Mr. Gray has a history of hypertension diagnosed at age 46  which is poorly controlled despite being on anti-hypertensive medication. He has no history of diabetes  heart disease  or chronic respiratory illness. His last health checkup was six months ago.  Family History His father had a history of aortic dissection at the age of 60 and died due to complications. His mother is alive and has a history of hypertension and diabetes. Mr. Gray has one sibling  an older brother who is healthy.  Clinical Examination On examination  there is a discrepancy in the blood pressure between both upper limbs with diminished left radial pulse. Neurological examination revealed mild weakness in left upper and lower limb suggestive of possible neurological deficits due to malperfusion. No significant findings on the abdominal and chest examination except for the pain on palpation in the chest region.  Investigations EKG showed non-specific ST-T wave changes and chest X-ray was suggestive of mediastinal widening. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a dilated aortic root with an intimal flap indicative of aortic dissection.  Consults/Referrals Cardiothoracic surgery was alerted promptly due to the suspected diagnosis of aortic dissection.   Management In the ER  Mr. Gray was managed with intravenous beta-blockers to control his blood pressure and decrease the """"shear stress"""" on the aortic wall. He was then shifted to ICU for close monitoring and he underwent successful surgical repair of the dissected aorta. He is currently stable and under post-operative care.  Follow-up and Prognosis Mr. Gray will need regular monitoring and strict blood pressure control. He was advised smoking cessation  regular exercise  and maintaining a healthy diet. As aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition and can reoccur  his prognosis will highly depend on his adherence to the therapy and lifestyle changes. His high-risk features included uncontrolled hypertension  smoking history  and familial predisposition. However  successful surgery and controlled blood pressure can substantially decrease his risk for future aortic complications.   MR. Gray requires a long-term personalized care approach including early detection and management of risk factors  genetic counseling  and regular surveillance to improve his life quality and expectancy.

11,9,29,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial29,"Patient Profile:  Mr. J is a 58-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He's a known smoker  with a 20 pack-year history. His family history includes his father dying from an aortic dissection at the age of 62.  Chief Complaint: The patient presented to the emergency room with severe chest pain that he described as a """"tearing"""" sensation  radiating to his back. It was sudden in onset and has been persistent for the last three hours.  Clinical Presentation: Mr. J looked anxious and in distress. His vital signs revealed blood pressure of 200/120 mmHg  with a disproportional reading between his right and left arm. His pulse was 110 bpm  and he was afebrile. On physical examination  a diastolic murmur was heard which raised the suspicion of aortic regurgitation.  Relevant Investigations: Laboratory investigations showed a raised D-dimer level. Due to high suspicion for aortic dissection  a CT angiogram of the chest was ordered. It revealed a Stanford type B aortic dissection starting from the descending thoracic aorta and extending down to the level of the renal arteries. The true lumen appears compressed and the dissection flap is visible.  Management: The patient was admitted to the ICU for monitoring and blood pressure control. He was commenced on labetalol IV infusion  with a tight control of his blood pressure  aiming for SBP of around 120 mmHg. Due to the distal location of the dissection and absence of complications such as malperfusion or rupture  the case was managed medically rather than surgically per guidelines. Consultations with cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology teams were done simultaneously.  Follow Up and Prognosis: The patient will need dedicated follow-up with Cardiology and Vascular Surgery in the outpatient clinic for regular monitoring of his aortic diameter  as well as aggressive management of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Lifestyle modification  including smoking cessation  diet control  and exercise was encouraged.  This case is illustrative of a scenario where hypertensive emergencies could potentially be lethal  stressing the importance of cardiovascular preventive care."
11,9,30,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial30,Patient Presentation  Mr. Johnson is a 59-year-old Caucasian male presenting with chief complaints of sudden and severe chest pain radiating to his back  coupled with shortness of breath  sweating  and palpitations. The patient describes the pain as 'tearing' and states it began after he had dinner.  Past Medical History  Mr. Johnson had been diabetic for the past 10 years and developed hypertension 5 years ago. Both conditions are managed with medication. He is a former smoker  quit 10 years ago  but had a 30 pack-year history. He also reports a history of high cholesterol level running in the family.  Family History  His father passed away at 65 from a heart attack and his mother succumbed to a stroke at 70. He has a younger brother who was diagnosed with angina at age 45.  Physical Examination / Vitals  Mr. Johnson seemed relatively alert but anxious on examination. His blood pressure was significantly different in both arms - 200/120 mmHg in the right and 160/90 mmHg in the left. Heart rate was 98 bpm  respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute  and temperature was 98.7 F. Initial physical examination revealed a diastolic murmur best heard at the right sternal border along with mild abdominal and pedal edema.  Investigations  A chest X-ray demonstrated a widened mediastinum and d-dimer showed the elevation indicating the probability of an aortic dissection. Subsequent diagnosis was made via CT angiography which demonstrated a Stanford Type A aortic dissection from the ascending aorta to the aortic arch with a slight involvement of the descending aorta.  Management  Mr. Johnson was immediately started on Intravenous beta-blockers to decrease the ventricular contraction force and velocity  thereby reducing shear stress on the aortic wall. Surgery consultation was done offers his subtle signs of malperfusion  and the surgeon agreed with the management plan  deciding to perform an emergent surgical repair of the ascending aorta.  Discussion  This case underscores the importance of a high degree of suspicion and eliciting a detailed history in cases presenting with severe  acute chest pain. Despite having multiple risk factors such as male gender  hypertension  diabetes  age above 55  smoking history  and familial history  aortic dissection remained a less considered differential. The different blood pressures in both arms and radiological findings helped in early diagnosis and management  potentially preventing catastrophic consequences.

11,9,32,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial32,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. Nathan  is a 68-year-old African American male born and raised in Texas  USA. He presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe  sharp chest and back pain. The pain is typically relieved once sitting up  but worsens on lying down and during physical activity. He rated the pain as 10/10.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Nathan reported having been previously diagnosed with Marfan syndrome  a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue. He received arthroscopic knee surgery a year ago due to joint problems associated with the syndrome. He was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago  and his control has been poor due to nonadherence to antihypertensive drugs  mainly angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). He also has a 10-year history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is a former smoker with a 20 pack-year history.  Family History:  There is a positive family history of Marfan syndrome in his maternal line. His mother died due to aortic dissection at the age of 75. As well  his elder sister has been diagnosed with this syndrome.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  he appeared anxious with pale skin. His blood pressure was high at 160/110 mm Hg  and he had a rapid heart rate of 110 beats per minute. There was a noted difference in blood pressure between his arms  and a diastolic murmur was discernible upon cardiac auscultation.      Diagnostic Testing:  A computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest was performed  confirming an aortic dissection involving the ascending and descending aorta. Further  a Complete Blood Count (CBC)  Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)  and Troponin I tests were performed  which showed mild anemia and elevated liver enzymes and cardiac markers.   Case Analysis:  Mr. Nathan’s presentation of severe chest pain  his genetic predisposal to aortic diseases and his uncontrolled hypertension illuminated the possibility of an aortic dissection. Early recognition of this deadly pathology is vital to ensure urgent surgical repair and to improve patient outcomes. His case presents the challenge of managing this emergency condition in a patient with a significant burden of coexisting conditions like COPD  Marfan Syndrome  and poor hypertension control. Additionally  this case emphasizes the importance of drug adherence for managing hypertensive individuals  given its role in preventing complications  such as aortic dissection.

11,9,35,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial35,Patient Case Presentation: Aortic Dissection  Patient Information: Mr. Robert Smith  a 58-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain that had begun six hours prior. The pain was sharp  severe  with a tearing/ripping sensation radiating to the back. The patient is a known smoker with a 30 pack-year history and consumes a moderate amount of alcohol on occasion. He is unmarried  lives alone  works as a bank clerk  and has a sedentary lifestyle.  Past Medical History: He has a history of untreated hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and obesity. He has never had any surgeries.  Familial History: His father suffered a fatal myocardial infarction at the age of 65  while his mother died of stroke in her late 70s. There are no known genetic or inheritable conditions in the family.  Presenting Illness: The patient first described his pain while he was at work. He initially thought it to be heartburn  but the persisting and worsening pain made him realize that it might be more severe. Accompanying symptoms were profuse sweat and mild dizziness  but there were no symptoms like numbness  loss of consciousness or changes in vision. There was no relief or aggravation with movement or breath.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  his weight was 235lbs (BMI 34.4)  with a blood pressure of 180/95 mmHg  pulse 106/min  and respirations of 22 per minute. His physical exam was predominantly normal  except for mild pallor.  Diagnostic Evaluation: Upon initial diagnostic workup to rule out acute myocardial infarction  we performed an ECG  chest X-ray and cardiac markers  all of which were normal. We proceeded to a computed tomography angiography (CTA) due to high suspicion of aortic dissection given his symptoms  medical history and family history. The CTA revealed an acute aortic dissection involving the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.  Treatment: The nature and severity of the aortic dissection categorized under type A indicated an urgent need for surgical intervention. Consequently  Mr. Smith was promptly referred to cardiothoracic surgery for an urgent surgical repair. We have also begun medical management with beta-blockers to lower blood pressure and heart rate  aiming to decrease the sheer stress on the aorta.  The patient was notified of the seriousness of his condition and was given consent for the surgery. We discussed the necessity to manage his risk factors in the aftermath of his surgery  particularly hypertension  obesity  and smoking cessation. A long-term follow-up and rehabilitation plan will be developed post-surgery with the involvement of nutritionists  physiotherapists and counsellors.

11,9,39,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial39,Patient Summary:  Presenting is a 65-year-old African American male named Mr. Johnson. He lives in a semi-urban setting with his wife and retired from a clerical job about five years ago. He is a non-smoker and a non-drinker but has been moderately active throughout his life. He has a known history of hypertension for 15 years  for which he takes Capoten 25mg twice daily. He is also diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and is consistently on Metformin. He has no known allergies.  Problem:  Mr. Johnson showed up at the ER with complaints of intense  sharp  tearing chest pain radiating to his back. The pain started two hours before his presentation and was sudden in onset. He is conscious  oriented but appears to be in distress due to pain. He rates it 10/10 on the pain scale. He reports no similar episodes in the past  no allergies  fevers  breathlessness  or dizziness.  Family History:  His father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. His mother  aged 85  is healthy and has no significant health concerns. He has two siblings  both of whom are healthy  but his elder brother has a history of high blood pressure.  Clinical Findings:  When he first presented  his blood pressure was 180/110mmHg  heart rate was 68 beats per minute  respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation level was 98%. On examination  his cardiovascular and respiratory systems were normal  as per auscultation and percussion. Aortic dissection was suspected due to the nature and severity of his pain combined with his elevated blood pressure.  Investigation:  A CT scan was immediately ordered  which confirmed the aortic dissection  involving the ascending aorta and extending to the aortic arch. Labs came back with high white blood cells and D-Dimer along with mildly elevated blood glucose levels confirming the suspicion of aortic dissection.  Hospital Course:  He was immediately started on intravenous beta-blockers and nitroprusside to lower his blood pressure and alleviate his pain. He was admitted to the ICU where he was closely monitored.  Diagnosis:  Acute Type A Aortic Dissection secondary to hypertension.  Treatment Plan:  The cardiothoracic team recommended immediate surgical repair of the dissection  considering that it is a Type A dissection.  Conclusion:  Given his high risk of rupture and considering the location of the dissection  the team has decided to move towards surgery. After successful surgery and recovery  Mr. Johnson will be placed on a lifestyle modification plan and augmented hypertensive regimen to control his blood pressure and prevent further occurrences. - Outpatient follow-up will be organized with cardiology and endocrinology to manage his hypertension  diabetes  and post-operative course.  This case of Mr. Johnson helps us understand that acute aortic dissection can present with severe  sharp chest pain  and individuals with high blood pressure run an increased risk of the condition. Immediate medical attention is necessary when such symptoms occur to prevent fatality.

He had no family history of Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  Workup:  Given Mr. X's symptoms and family history  a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was ordered. It showed an aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending into the descending aorta.  Management:  Mr. X was emergently started on intravenous beta-blockers to control blood pressure. He immediately underwent successful aortic repair with graft placement.  Key Points:  This case underscores the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis of aortic dissection to prevent fatal complications. Risk factors include hypertension  smoking  and a family history of aortic disease. Clinicians must maintain high suspicion for the illness when patients present with abrupt-onset chest pain  particularly in the presence of hypertension.  Prompt control of blood pressure and definitive surgical or interventional strategies are key to survival and recovery. Prevention strategies should include aggressive control of blood pressure and lifestyle changes  such as smoking cessation given patient's history. Regular follow-ups for monitoring of graft placement and cardiovascular health were scheduled."
11,9,42,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial42,Patient Identification: Male  68 years old  Caucasian  6’3; weight: 225 lbs  non-smoker  non-drinker.  Chief Complaint: The patient presented to the Emergency Department complaining of sudden onset severe chest pain that radiated to the back.  Past Medical History: He has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and has been diagnosed with Marfan's Syndrome at age 25. He has undergone aortic valve replacement surgery 8 years ago.  Family History: Both parents passed away from heart-related issues in their late 70s. The patient has one brother who also has Marfan's Syndrome and has had aortic surgery. His son  now 38  was recently diagnosed with Marfan's Syndrome but has not shown any cardiac symptoms yet.  Physical Examination: On observation  the patient appeared anxious  profusely sweating with decreased breath sounds on the left side of the chest. Heart sounds were muffled but no abnormalities were noticed. The blood pressure was 178/98 mmHg  pulse 110 bpm  respiratory rate 24/min  temperature 97.8 F. Pupils were slightly dilated but reactive to light.  Investigation: ECG was performed immediately which showed no signs of myocardial infarction  but Chest X-ray indicated widening of the mediastinum. Blood investigations were normal except the high D-dimer levels. Confirmation of aortic dissection was made by a CT angiogram  showing an intimal flap in the ascending thoracic aorta  classifying it as a Stanford Type A dissection.   Discussion: The patient's longstanding history of Marfan Syndrome  aortic valve replacement and family history of Marfan Syndrome significantly increases his predisposition to develop an aortic dissection. Pertinent symptoms such as sudden and severe chest pain radiating to the back  alongside physiological and imaging findings  support the diagnosis of aortic dissection.  Treatment: He was immediately started on beta-blockers to control blood pressure and heart rate  in addition to pain control. Given the location of the dissection  the patient must undergo emergency surgical intervention.    The patient's relatives were informed and the seriousness of the patient's condition was explained  along with the potential risks and benefits of the operation. They have agreed to proceed with the surgery.   The goal of this case presentation is to underline the importance of acknowledging the risk of severe and potentially fatal complications in patients with Marfan's Syndrome  and the need for vigilant monitoring and management of these patients.    Next steps are immediate surgical intervention  long-term management of hypertension  continued surveillance for further aortic dilation  and genetic counseling for relatives.

11,9,43,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial43,"Case Presentation:  Patient Profile: Mr. J  a 65-year-old male of African American descent was brought in to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to his back. He has a long history of hypertension and 10-year history of diabetes. Does not smoke or drink alcohol. Both his father and uncle had heart diseases  and died under the age of 70.  Clinical Presentation: Upon arrival  Mr. J was in acute distress  clutching his chest and describing the pain as a """"tearing"""" or """"ripping"""" sensation. The Health care team note his blood pressure was 210/110 mmHg  pulse rate 98 per minute  and respiratory rate 20 per minute  all signs of hypertension crisis. There was a difference in blood pressures between his two arms  with the left measuring higher than the right. Other physical exam findings included a diastolic murmur and faint pulse in the lower extremities.  Past Medical History: It is essential to note that Mr. J had been treated for uncontrolled hypertension and has had type 2 diabetes for the past 10 years. His hypertension medication compliance has been spotty  leading to extended periods of uncontrolled high blood pressure.  Diagnostic Investingations: An urgent CT scan was performed and confirmed a type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the iliac arteries.  Treatment Options: In terms of treatment  surgical repair was considered the best option because of the location of the dissection (type A) to reduce the risk of rupture  despite the patient's age.  Discussion:  The major risk factors that lead to aortic dissection in this patient were uncontrolled hypertension and a positive family history of heart diseases  both of which contributed to the wear and tear of his aortic wall leading to the dissection. Dyslipidemia  tobacco usage  and age are other common risk factors. This case emphasizes the importance of adequate control of hypertension  which could potentially have prevented the development of this life-threatening condition.  This presentation may serve as an essential educational tool highlighting the need for an immediate diagnostic approach  immediate control of the blood pressure  and the rapid transition to surgical intervention when necessary in managing aortic dissection.   Considerations for this patient going forward include strict blood pressure control  managing diabetes appropriately  lifestyle changes  and ongoing monitor for complications related to aortic dissection."
11,9,44,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial44,Patient Presentation  Patient Information: A 65-year-old Caucasian male from a suburban setting.  Chief Complaint: The patient presented in the emergency department complaining of sudden onset  sharp  tearing chest pain radiating to his back.  History of Present Illness: The patient revealed that the pain started abruptly  is severe and has not subsided. The pain was initially located in the anterior chest and has subsequently shifted towards the back. He reports overwhelming anxiety and a sense of impending doom.  Past Medical History: The patient has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for which he is on oral hypoglycemic drugs. He also has a history of hypertension. Reports that he had been on a regime of Losartan until about ten months previously when he stopped the medication due to financial issues.  Family History: Both parents are deceased. The father died from a stroke at age 69 and the mother from breast cancer at age 72.  Social History: The patient is married and has two adult children. He is a retired electrician. His alcohol consumption is moderate and he has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years.  Physical Examination: The patient was diaphoretic and appeared in acute distress. Physical exam indicated differing blood pressures in both arms  a diastolic murmur best heard at the right sternal border  and weak pedal pulses.  Diagnostic Results: A chest X-ray revealed mediastinal widening. The EKG showed non-specific ST-T changes. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was subsequently performed and confirmed the diagnosis of type A aortic dissection: there is an intimal flap separating the true and false lumen  which involves the ascending and descending thoracic aorta  including the arch.  Impression/Plan: The patient was diagnosed with a life-threatening proximal aortic dissection likely due to longstanding untreated hypertension. He was immediately transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery team for consideration of emergent intervention.  Case Notes: This case emphasizes the importance of considering aortic dissection in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute chest pain  especially those with a history of hypertension and other risk factors.  Attendance to red flag signs such as unequal blood pressures  a new diastolic murmur  and neurological signs  along with appropriate diagnostic tests  including CTA Chest  can swiftly direct clinicians toward making this critical diagnosis. It also highlights the importance of regular follow-ups and medication compliance in chronic diseases like hypertension to prevent severe complications like aortic dissection.

11,9,45,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial45,Patient Introduction:   The patient is a 60-year-old African American male currently living in Washington D.C. He is retired from the US Army and lives alone. The patient does not smoke and rarely drinks alcohol.   Presenting Problem:  He presented to the Emergency Department complaining of a sudden onset  severe chest pain that radiated to his back  which began about two hours prior to arrival at the hospital. The pain was described as tearing and was not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.  Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension six years ago and takes Losartan 50mg daily. However  he admits to poor adherence to his antihypertensive medication for the past 2-3 months due to financial constraints. He denies history of diabetes  asthma  and any malignancies. He had an appendectomy at age 25  and there is no known drug allergy.  Family History:  His father died of myocardial infarction at age 58 and his mother died from a stroke at age 78. He has two older brothers  one diagnosed with hypertension and the other with type II diabetes.  Examination:  On physical examination  his blood pressure was found to be 180/120 mmHg and pulse was 88 bpm. He had a noticeable asymmetry in pulse and blood pressure between his right and left arms. His cardiac exam revealed a harsh grade 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border. His lungs were clear on auscultation. There were no renal bruits.  Diagnostic information:  The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no clear signs of myocardial infarction  and his initial cardiac enzymes were normal. However  a Computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest revealed an aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta  descending thoracic aorta  and abdominal aorta.  Clinical Course:  The patient was transferred to the surgical ICU for urgent surgical repair of the dissection as his involvement of ascending aorta classified him as Stanford type A - which is a surgical emergency. He was also initiated on intravenous antihypertensive agents to strictly control his blood pressure and heart rate. His recovery was uneventful and was discharged on post-op day 10 with close follow-ups directed. He was also referred to a social worker to help him apply for public assistance to afford his antihypertensive medications.  Learning point:  This case highlights the importance of strictly controlling blood pressure in patients with hypertension to prevent fatal outcomes  such as aortic dissection. It also puts emphasis on the unique clinical presentation of aortic dissection and how emergent recognition can save lives. It also showcases the impact of social determinants of health and the consequence of unaffordability of medications.
11,9,46,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial46,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 65-year-old African American male who presented to the emergency department with severe and sudden onset chest pain radiating to his back  a classic presenting symptom of an aortic dissection.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension  controlled with medication  and smoking. He denies any prior history of cardiovascular disease  diabetes mellitus  or other chronic diseases. He also reports no history of rheumatic fever or surgeries.  Current Medication:  The patient is currently on lisinopril 10mg once daily for hypertension and a daily aspirin. He reports good medication adherence.  Family History:   The patient's father died at 50 from a myocardial infarction  and his mother suffers from hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He has one brother who is currently healthy.  Social History:  The patient smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily for thirty years. He consumes alcohol occasionally but denies illicit drug use. He is a retired engineer and his level of stress is described as minimal.  Clinical Examination and Investigations:  On examination  his pulse was 85 bpm with disparity between right and left arm  and his blood pressure was 180/110 mmHg. A Grade III early-diastolic murmur was noted. The rest of his examination was unremarkable.   Critical investigations showed a raised D-dimer and a CT scan revealed a dissection beginning in the ascending aorta and extending past the aortic arch  indicating a Stanford Type A dissection.  Current problem:   The patient fractured his aorta  which is an emergency and life-threatening condition that needs immediate management.  Plan of Management:  The primary intervention recommended in the case of a Stanford Type A aortic dissection is surgery. The patient is being referred to cardiovascular surgery as an emergency. In the interim  blood pressure control is being managed through the use of IV labetalol to maintain systolic blood pressure between 100-120mmHg. This will serve to reduce the shearing forces acting upon the aorta to prevent further extension of the dissection.  Discussion:  Aortic dissection is a severe condition with a high rate of mortality without surgical management. This patient’s risk factors included a family history of cardiovascular disease  smoking  and poorly controlled hypertension. Hospital mortality and long-term survival are greatly improved by early diagnosis and appropriate surgical intervention. Hence the need for emergency surgery.
11,9,47,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial47,"Patient Presentation:  A 68-year-old Caucasian male  named Mr. J  presented to the emergency department with acute  severe chest pain. The pain was described as """"tearing"""" and radiating to his back. He had a past medical history significant for hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 20-year history of smoking. His father died from a myocardial infarction at the age of 65  and his mother had a stroke at the age of 70. He has two siblings  both of whom are presently healthy.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  his blood pressure was found to be elevated at 160/95 mm Hg  and his heart rate was noted to be irregular at 100 beats per minute. Pulse deficit was noted with weaker pulses in the lower extremities compared to upper extremities. There was a discrepancy between blood pressure measurements on both arms. His breath sounds were equal bilaterally  but a diastolic murmur was noted. The patient was alert and oriented but appeared in acute distress due to pain.  Investigations:  Initial investigations  including a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel  were within normal limits. The electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy but no acute ischemic changes. Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis of a Stanford type A aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta down to the abdominal aorta.  Treatment:  The patient was given intravenous beta-blockers to lower his heart rate and blood pressure  and a nitroprusside infusion was initiated to further decrease the aortic shear stress. Given the Stanford type A dissection  the patient was soon taken to the operating room where he underwent emergent surgical repair of his aortic dissection. His postoperative course was uneventful.  Discussion:  The above case illustrates an aortic dissection  a life-threatening condition frequently associated with hypertension  genetic disorders  and smoking. Acute chest pain  especially with a ripping or tearing quality  should always raise suspicion for this condition. Besides  pulse deficits or different blood pressures in the arms were important clinical clues that the chest pain may be due to aortic dissection. Early diagnosis and management are critical in aortic dissection  as delays in treatment can result in serious complications  such as organ damage  stroke  and death. Besides  the familial history of cardiovascular diseases in this case also highlights the importance of taking a thorough family history  as it might suggest an inherited connective tissue disorder  which is considered a risk factor for aortic dissection."

11,9,49,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial49,Title: Aortic Dissection - A Case Study  Patient Presentation:  Mr. G  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  presents with severe  continuous  and tearing chest pain that started suddenly in the middle of his chest and radiates to his back. Accompanying symptoms are shortness of breath  sweating  and fainting. Mr. G’s blood pressure is uneven with the right arm showing a higher reading than the left.  Past Medical History:   Mr. G has a significant medical history of uncontrolled hypertension for 20 years. He has a history of smoking for 30 years and quit five years back. Mr. G was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and he has been taking Statins for the same. He has no known drug allergies.  Family History:   The patient’s maternal uncle reportedly had an incident of aortic dissection in his late fifties. Mr. G’s elder brother has coronary artery disease  and his father had a stroke in his sixties.  Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  he appeared diaphoretic and in significant distress. He had asymmetric blood pressure of 145/95 mmHg in his right arm and 130/86 mmHg in his left arm. Pulse on left radial artery was weak compared to the right. Heart sounds were normal and no murmur was heard.  Investigations:  Promptly  Mr. G was sent for a transthoracic echocardiogram and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan. The tests confirmed the presence of an intimal flap in the ascending aorta and descending aorta  indicative of a Type A aortic dissection.  Management:  Mr. G was emergently started on labetalol (an alpha/beta blocker) to control his blood pressure. He was eventually taken for emergency open-heart surgery for aortic replacement.  Discussion:  Aortic dissection is a potentially fatal condition that commonly occurs due to a tear in the inner layer of the aorta  mainly in hypertensive patients. Risk factors for Mr. G included longstanding hypertension  history of smoking  and family predisposition. Therefore  early diagnosis and management are crucial.  Prognosis:  Mr. G's prognosis will largely be determined by his response to the emergency surgical intervention and the post-operative period  including blood pressure control and surveillance for potential complications like aortic rupture  or organ malfunction.   Conclusively  this case underscores the significance of prompt identification and management of aortic dissection in the context of severe  unusual chest pain  especially in patients with risk factors such as hypertension.
11,9,50,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial50,Case Presentation:  Patient Details: We are evaluating Mr. Johnson  a 67-year-old Caucasian male  currently residing in Austin  Texas. He works as an accountant and lives with his wife. He has a history of smoking about a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years but quit 5 years ago. He's an occasional drinker and denies any illicit drug usage.   Chief Complaint: Mr. Johnson reported to the emergency room with symptoms of intense  sharp chest pain that radiated to his back - particularly between his shoulder blades. He also described experiencing severe anxiety and a sensation of impending doom.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a known history of controlled hypertension for the past 10 years and was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus 5 years ago which is managed with oral medication. He does not have any surgical history. He has had annual physical checkups with no significant findings. He was on antihypertensive drugs (Lisinopril and Amlodipine) and Metformin for his diabetes.  Family History: His mother died of a stroke at the age of 75 and his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. His older brother was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm at age 71.  Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. Johnson exhibited cold and clammy skin. Upon further investigation  there was a significant disparity found between the blood pressures of his right and left extremities - the right being considerably higher.  Diagnostic Evaluation: An emergent CT scan was performed which confirmed an aortic dissection starting just after the aortic valve and extending into the descending thoracic aorta. The dissection was classified as Stanford type A. The ECG found no signs of a heart attack. Elevated d-dimer levels also signified potential dissection.   Management: Keeping in mind the severity and current state of symptoms  Mr. Johnson was promptly referred for emergency surgery. In addition to surgical repair  he was stabilised preoperatively with beta blockers and other antihypertensive medications with meticulous blood pressure management.  Discussion: Mr. Johnson's risk factors  compounded by his family history and hypertension  made him susceptible to an aortic dissection. His sudden onset of severe chest pain necessitated appropriate diagnostic testing like a CT scan  which confirmed the diagnosis. His case illustrates the importance of rapid diagnosis and treatment of aortic dissection  highlighting the importance of immediate surgical intervention in reducing associated morbidity and mortality.
11,9,51,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial51,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe is a 65-year old Caucasian male with a significant past medical history of untreated hypertension and coronary artery disease. He was diagnosed through CT angiography with an ascending thoracic aortic dissection which has begun extending from the aortic root to the brachiocephalic artery.   Mr. Doe initially presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden severe chest pain radiating to the back and difficulty in breathing. His BP measured in the ER was 195/115 mmHg  which was consistent with his history of untreated hypertension. The vitals showed tachycardia  and examination was significant for a difference in blood pressures between the two upper limbs.   The past medical history revealed that he had a myocardial infarction five years ago but had not consistently followed up with his cardiologist due to his firm belief in natural therapies. His lifestyle factors include high consumption of salt  limited physical activity  and a 20-pack year history of smoking.  Family history includes a father who died of an acute myocardial infarction at 70 and a mother who died from stroke at the age of 75. His 62-year old brother recently had a stent placed due to coronary artery disease. There is no known family history of connective tissue diseases or sudden cardiac death.  Due to his age  medical history of hypertension and coronary artery disease  and current presentation with a significantly higher blood pressure reading  he was at a high risk for aortic dissection. Further workup including CT angiography was completed and the diagnosis was confirmed.  Discussion:  Aortic dissection occurs when a tear develops in the inner layer of the aorta causing blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall  forcing the layers apart. It is a serious condition needing urgent treatment. Mr. Doe’s history of hypertension along with coronary artery disease placed him on a high risk for this condition. The type of dissection he was diagnosed with  has immediate potential life-threatening consequences if left untreated. It is important that Mr. Doe be educated on the seriousness of his condition  the need for urgent surgical intervention  in addition to comprehensive management of his hypertension post-treatment. Cessation of smoking  diet modifications and regular physical activity would also be beneficial for his overall cardiovascular health.   Future encounters with the healthcare system using a multidisciplinary team approach for managing co-existing health issues will improve the quality of life and prevent further possible complications.
11,9,52,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial52,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 68-year-old Caucasian male who presented with sudden onset and severe anterior chest pain radiating to his back. His past medical history includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and smoking. He has no known allergies and takes Lisinopril for hypertension and Pravastatin for his high cholesterol levels. There's no reported family history of cardiovascular disease  though his father was diagnosed with lung cancer due to heavy smoking. He is a retired electrician  is married  and has two children.  Clinical Findings:  He was pale and complained of severe generalized weakness. His blood pressure was noted to be 180/110 mmHg in the right arm and 160/100 mmHg in the left. His pulse was 100 beats per minute  respiration rate was 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was noted to be 95% on room air. Results from the 12-lead EKG did not show any signs of acute myocardial infarction  but showed early signs of left ventricular hypertrophy.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Suspecting aortic dissection on the basis of clinical findings and history  a CT scan of the chest was ordered. The report confirmed the presence of a Stanford Type A aortic dissection  extending from the ascending aorta to the bilateral iliac arteries.  Therapeutic Intervention:  He was immediately started on approved medications to lower his blood pressure and heart rate. In consultation with a cardiovascular surgeon  it was decided the patient was eligible for emergency surgery given his overall good health and the severity of the dissection.  Discussion:  Mr. J's long history of uncontrolled hypertension seems to have played a significant role in the development of his aortic dissection  as it is one of the most common risk factors. His smoking  albeit in the past  might also have contributed to the disease.  Follow-up:  Post-surgery  the patient was transferred to the ICU where he was on inotropes to maintain adequate blood pressure. His immediate post-operative period was uneventful. He was discharged on the 10th post-operative day with instructions to regularly follow-up with the cardiology outpatient department.  A more heart-healthy lifestyle has been strongly advised to Mr. J  including diet changes  regular exercise  the cessation of smoking  and maintaining control over cholesterol and blood pressure levels. The patient was given appropriate appointments for follow-ups  and any required changes in medication were duly noted. Immediate attention in case of similar pain was advised. His family has also been informed about the nature of the disease and the lifestyle changes required.
11,9,53,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial53,"Patient Profile: The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male with a diagnosis of aortic dissection. He is around 5'11"""" and weighs 220 pounds. He lives in New York  is recently retired from his job as an engineer  and lives with his wife. He has two grown-up children and is a social drinker but does not smoke.  Past Medical History: The patient does not have a personal history of hypertension or diabetes but suffers from obesity and mild dyslipidemia.

He doesn't take any regular medication but has a history of sporadic use of over-the-counter NSAIDs for joint pain.  Current Medical Situation: The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain radiating towards his back  describing it as a 'tearing' pain. The pain started while he was rest at home. He also reported feeling dizzy but denied other symptoms like palpitations  shortness of breath  nausea  and sweating.   Family History: His father passed away at the age of 59 due to myocardial infarction  and his grandfather suffered from a stroke. There's no family history of aortic diseases or connective tissue disorders.  Clinical Examination: Upon examination  his blood pressure was found to be significantly different between both the arms  and his heart rate was slightly above normal. The cardiovascular exam revealed a diastolic murmur  and neurological examination was unremarkable.   Investigation and Diagnosis: His ECG was unspecific  showing nonspecific ST and T wave abnormalities. However  a CT scan of the chest showed a Stanford Type A aortic dissection starting just above the aortic valve and extending up to the brachiocephalic artery. His blood tests revealed slightly elevated D-dimer and Troponin I levels  suggesting cardiac strain.  Management: The patient was immediately started on IV beta-blockers to lower the sheer stress on the aorta. He was immediately referred for emergent surgical intervention to prevent complications like aortic rupture  myocardial infarction  or stroke.  In summary  this patient's untreated dyslipidemia  sporadic use of NSAIDs  family history of cardiac disease  and his recent symptoms of chest pain could have potentially contributed to the development of an aortic dissection. This case emphasizes the importance of routine cardiovascular risk assessment and management  especially in individuals with a family history of heart disease."

11,9,59,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial59,Patient Information:  Mr. John Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presenting with severe (10/10) retrosternal chest pain that radiates to his back. He describes the pain as sudden  sharp  and tearing. He has a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia and a 10-year history of smoking. He is non-compliant with his antihypertensive medication. He also reports shortness of breath and nausea.   Family History:  Mr. Smith's father died at the age of 70 due to a stroke and his mother died from breast cancer at the age of 78. His younger brother  aged 63  is currently living with a confirmed diagnosis of hypertension and diabetes.  Clinical Findings: Upon examination  his blood pressure in the right arm was 180/110 mmHg and in the left arm was 165/95 mmHg. His pulse rate was 110 beats per minute  and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute. An initial examination revealed diaphoresis and pallor. There were no other significant physical findings. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left ventricular hypertrophy with strain pattern  but it did not reveal any signs of myocardial ischemia or infarction.    Diagnostic Assessment: A high suspicion for aortic dissection prompted an urgent computerized tomography (CT) scan  which confirmed the diagnosis of a Type A ascending aortic dissection starting just above the sinotubular junction and extending into the ascending aorta. Blood tests showed elevated D-dimer levels.   Therapeutic Intervention: Mr. Smith was admitted into intensive care for immediate surgical intervention. Intravenous beta-blockers were administered as first-line treatment to control blood pressure before surgery. A successful emergency ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement surgery was performed using a prosthetic graft.  Outcome and Follow-Up: Post-operation  his condition has stabilized  and his blood pressure is now under control. He was advised to quit smoking and was educated on the importance of adhering to antihypertensive medication. He will remain on blood pressure control medications and will have regular follow-ups every three months to monitor healing and blood pressure levels. He was also referred for genetic counseling to assess if there is a hereditary component to his aortic dissection  which may impact his children.
11,9,60,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial60,Patient Presentation  Mr. James Stevens is a 58-year-old Caucasian male  currently residing in Austin  Texas. He is married  a former smoker  and leads a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity due to his occupational demands as a Financial Analyst.  Past Medical History  Mr. Stevens has a known history of hypertension for the past ten years  on pharmacological treatment; yet  his blood pressure control has been suboptimal. He is also diabetic  diagnosed five years ago  for which he is being managed with oral hypoglycemic drugs. His records also show mild atheromatous changes in carotid vessels diagnosed two years ago. He has no history of surgeries. He is not known to have any allergies.  Family History  His father passed away at 67 due to myocardial infarction  and his mother passed away at 75 due to stroke. He has one brother who is also hypertensive.  Presenting Complaints  Mr. Stevens presented at the emergency department with sudden severe pain in his chest extending to his back. He describes the pain as 'tearing' in nature  starting while he was at work  and it has persisted.   Examination   On physical examination  he appeared in distress  BP was 180/110 mm Hg  pulse-60/min  and respiratory rate-20 per minute. Examination of cardiovascular system revealed disparity in blood pressure between two arms  faint diastolic murmur over aortic area  and weak peripheral pulses.   Investigations and Diagnosis:  Given his history and signs  a presumptive diagnosis of aortic dissection was made  and he was immediately rushed for further investigations. His lab investigations were within normal limits except for mildly raised blood glucose levels. His chest X-ray revealed a widened mediastinal shadow. An ECG showed no signs of myocardial ischemia. A CT aortogram confirmed an intimal flap in the descending thoracic aorta consistent with type B aortic dissection.  Treatment and Prognosis:  Given the diagnosis of a type B aortic dissection and his current clinical stability  he was initiated on aggressive medical management with beta-blockers and nitroprusside to control his blood pressure and heart rate. He responded well to the medications  and his pain dramatically subsided.  The patient was educated about the importance of lifestyle modifications  strict blood pressure control  and regular follow-ups. He was scheduled for close outpatient monitoring with repeat imaging in one month to assess the stability of the aortic dissection. His prognosis  considering his age  co-morbidities  and timely intervention  is cautiously optimistic  but he is at risk for potential complications like aortic rupture  organ damage  and stroke.
11,9,61,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial61,Patient Presentation:  Patient X is a 60-year-old Caucasian male  a retired mechanic  referred from his primary care provider due to sudden  severe chest pain described as sharp and radiating to his back. He reported no history of similar discomfort. The patient lives alone and doesn't smoke or drink alcohol. He has no known drug allergies.   Past Medical History:   He suffers from controlled hypertension for the past 20 years  for which he takes Lisinopril 10mg daily. He was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus eight years ago  controlled by diet alone. He had no history of surgery or hospitalizations. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia.   Family History:  There is a notable history of a brother who died suddenly in his 50s. The cause of death was uncertain as the family didn’t have an autopsy done. The patient's father had a heart attack at age 75  and his mother had a stroke in her late 70s. Both of his parents suffered from hypertension and passed away due to cardiovascular complications.  Physical Examination:  On examination  he was anxious  in obvious distress  and diaphoretic. His blood pressure was 180/100 mm Hg  heart rate 110 bpm  respirations 22 per minute  and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. A heart murmur was evident upon auscultation with decreased breath sounds at the left base. No abdominal or flank pain was reported. Neurological and sensory function were normal.  Investigations:  An electrocardiogram was taken; there were no specific ST-T changes. Bedside ultrasound showed possible pericardial effusion. Lab investigations showed slightly elevated d-Dimer  kidney function tests were within normal ranges  and blood sugar was slightly elevated. Given the severity of the chest pain and clinical features  a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was immediately performed which confirmed an ascending aortic dissection. Further heart investigations with coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis in coronary arteries.  Conclusion:  Patient X was diagnosed with an acute type A aortic dissection  secondarily complicated with pericardial effusion. However  due to his history of controlled hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  along with a family history of cardiovascular complications  he was at risk of aortic dissection.  Management:  This is a surgical emergency. Vascular surgery was consulted immediately  and he was promptly taken to the operating room for an emergency repair of the ascending aorta.

Because of his age  we discussed his cholesterol level  which had been borderline in the past. He has been advised for a healthier diet by his GP but he has not been on any statins to date.   The patient has no known allergies and has not been hospitalized for any surgical intervention previously.   Family History: Regarding his family history  his father died suddenly at age 60 but the specific cause was not known. The patient could not recall any significant heart-related problems in his close family members.  Clinical Examination and Diagnosis: Clinical examination revealed a BP discrepancy in both arms  with higher BP on the right side  and a diastolic murmur was noticed. An immediate CT aortic angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of an aortic dissection classified as Stanford Type A.  Current Situation: The patient has been stabilized with medication (including intravenous beta blockers to lower his heart rate and ultimately his blood pressure)  and a discussion about the risks and benefits of surgery is underway. The complexity of the patient's situation has been discussed with the multidisciplinary team including cardiologists  cardiovascular surgeons  nursing staff  and a social worker.   This case highlights the importance of considering aortic dissection as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain  especially in the presence of hypertension and other vascular diseases.

Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a 15-year history of uncontrolled hypertension and a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  primarily managed by oral antidiabetic drugs. He also has a 10-year history of hyperlipidemia. He has a previous history of smoking and alcohol use. There is no known history of any chronic pulmonological or gastroenterological disease.  Social History:  Mr. Smith is currently divorced and lives alone. He has two grown-up children who live out of state. He has been occasional tobacco smoker for the last 25 years and claims to drink socially.  Family History:  His father suffered from ischemic heart disease and died at the age of 60 due to myocardial infarction. His mother is alive and has a history of hypertension and breast cancer. There are no other significant illnesses or conditions in his immediate family history.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  his blood pressure was 190/110 mmHg in the right arm and 160/90 mmHg in the left arm. He had an increased heart rate of 100 beats per minute and was afebrile. The cardiovascular system examination revealed an early diastolic murmur. No abnormalities were found in other system examinations.  Investigations:  Lab tests showed mildly increased white blood cells and raised D-dimer levels. An Electrocardiogram suggested left ventricular hypertrophy  but no evident ischemic changes. An emergency computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the thorax confirmed an ascending aortic dissection beginning just above the sinotubular junction extending to the right common carotid artery.  Treatment:  Mr. Smith was admitted to the hospital and started on immediate medical management with blood pressure and heart rate control. He underwent successful emergency surgical repair (ascending aortic replacement with a synthetic graft) and is currently stable post-operatively on the surgical intensive care unit.  Plan:  His progress will be reviewed  and antihypertensive  antidiabetic  and statin therapy will be continued. He is to be counseled stop smoking  limit alcohol consumption  and adopt a healthy lifestyle for improving overall health. Regular follow-ups and imaging tests will be scheduled to monitor his recovery and detect potential complications early.  Challenges:  The challenges in this case include management of uncontrolled hypertension  the considerable surgical risk associated with repair of aortic dissection  and the patient’s solitary social situation which may affect adherence to medication and lifestyle change.  Summary:  Mr. Smith  a 56-year-old man with a medical history of poorly controlled hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia  underwent successful surgical repair for aortic dissection.

Mr. JB is a long-term smoker with a 45-pack-year history. He suffers from hypertension  which he manages with a regimen of antihypertensive medication  though his compliance is inconsistent. His past medical history includes peptic ulcer disease and hyperlipidemia  managed with statin treatment. He has no known drug allergies.  Social history reveals Mr. JB is a retired manual laborer who lives with his wife. He has two adult children and consumes alcohol socially. His father suffered from an aortic aneurysm and passed away at the age of 65.  Clinical Presentation:  Mr. JB reports a sudden  severe “tearing” chest pain  radiating towards the back in-between the shoulder blades. The intensity of the pain did not subside with rest. His vitals on arrival are: BP is 165/100 mmHg  pulse 110 BPM  temperature is 98.7°F  respiratory rate is 22 per minute  and SPO2 is 96% on room air. On physical examination  there are no peripheral signs of connective tissue disease  no murmurs  and good peripheral pulses are present.  Differential Diagnosis:  At this point  the primary differential diagnosis included aortic dissection  myocardial infarction  pulmonary embolism  and esophageal rupture given the severity  nature of the pain and his past medical and family histories.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  An electrocardiogram showed no evidence of acute ischemia or infarction. Full blood count  renal function  and troponin I tests were all normal. However  a chest X-ray showed mediastinal widening  which raised suspicion of aortic dissection. The diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography angiogram (CTA)  which revealed a type B aortic dissection beginning just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending to the renal arteries without involvement of side branches.  Management:  Given the diagnosis and the hemodynamic stability of Mr. JB  medical management with aggressive blood pressure control was initiated immediately with a goal to reduce shear forces on the aortic wall. He was admitted to the ICU and IV labetalol was started to lower blood pressure and heart rate.  After stabilization  Mr. JB was transferred to a higher-level facility for consideration of endovascular therapy. The patient was also counselled on lifestyle modifications including strict blood pressure control  smoking cessation  a low sodium diet  and regular follow-ups with a cardiovascular surgeon and cardiologist.  This case highlights the importance of having a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in a patient who presents with severe and abrupt onset chest pain  particularly when the patient has risk factors such as hypertension and a family history of aortic disease.

Family History:  Detailed family history reveals her mother had a stroke at the age of 75 and her father suffered from heart disease and passed away from a myocardial infarction in his early 60s. No siblings or children with any cardiovascular disease.  Physical Examination: Upon assessment  the patient has unstable vitals: BP 190/110mm Hg  Pulse 105 bpm  and respiratory rate 22 per minute. Upon examination  the patient was sweating  in visible distress  but was fully oriented.  Diagnostic Tests:  An ECG was performed to rule out any acute ischemic changes. CT scan with contrast of the chest showed an aortic dissection from the ascending to the descending thoracic aorta  confirming the diagnosis of a type A aortic dissection. Laboratory tests including CBC  CMP  cardiac enzymes  and coagulation studies were all within normal limits.  Management Plan: Due to the nature of the condition being potentially life-threatening  emergency cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery consultations were immediately requested. J.K. was promptly started on IV labetalol to keep her heart rate below 60 and her systolic blood pressure below 120.  Based on her chest CT findings  J.K. is a concrete candidate for emergent surgical repair due to a type A aortic dissection. Counsel about the risks and benefits of the procedure and attain informed consent for transfer to operating room.   Plan for postoperative recovery includes ICU admission and strict monitoring of her vitals  target heart rate  and blood pressure. Will also need intense physical therapy and a rigorous follow-up schedule with primary care and cardiovascular specialty care. Long-term prognosis with this intervention can be positive  but will require significant lifestyle modifications and strict adherence to medicinal regimen.   Conclusion:  Diagnosing aortic dissection is difficult due to its low incidence and variety of presentation. A strong clinical suspicion and history taking play an essential role in making a timely diagnosis  which is key to increasing the survival rate of patients with aortic dissection.

His mother died of breast cancer at age 76. One of his two brothers suffers from type 2 diabetes.  Examination:  Upon physical examination  the patient was conscious and oriented  but in obvious distress. Vital signs revealed blood pressure of 170/120 mmHg  heart rate of 80 beats/min  and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min. His Cardiovascular examination was significant for a systolic murmur over the right second intercostal space. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally screening for Marfan syndrome was negative  no skeletal deformities or abnormal hypermobility were identified.   Workup:   His EKG showed no signs of Myocardial ischemia. Chest X-Ray showed widened mediastinum. A CT scan was performed that revealed an intimal flap in the ascending aorta  confirming the diagnosis of an aortic dissection.  Plan:   The diagnosis was discussed with cardiothoracic surgery. Given the type A dissection noted on the CT scan  the patient was consented for emergency surgical intervention.   This case underlines the importance of considering aortic dissection as a differential diagnosis in patients with severe chest pain. Risk factors in this patient included longstanding uncontrolled hypertension and a history of smoking  both of which can contribute to the weakening of the arterial wall and eventually to an aortic dissection. The patient underwent successful surgery and was discharged on post-operative day 10 with close follow-up recommended in the vascular surgery clinic. His blood pressure medications were adjusted to ensure tighter control of his hypertension.  The patient was also strongly advised to quit smoking and was provided with resources to assist with smoking cessation."

The onset of pain was sudden while he was engaged in strenuous physical activity. The patient rated the pain as 10 on a scale of 1 to 10  describing it as """"ripping"""" or """"tearing.""""   Medical History: Mr. X has a medical history of untreated hypertension for the last 10 years. He has been non-compliant with his antihypertensive treatment plan due to a fear of side effects from medication. He has no known allergies but has a 20-year history of smoking and moderate alcohol use. His BMI is 29 indicating he is overweight. He also had a myocardial infarction at the age of 50 from which he fully recovered.  Family History: Both his parents died relatively young – his father from a heart attack at 55 and his mother from stroke at 58. His older brother  who is currently 69  has been recently diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease. No congenital diseases are reported in his family.  Current Presentation: On examination  his blood pressure was found to be significantly varied between the left and right arm  and he had a rapid pulse of 110 beats per minute. He showed symptoms of anxiety and profuse sweating. Cardiovascular examination revealed soft early diastolic murmur. Neurologically he was intact  with no focal signs. Blood tests showed elevated D-dimer and the EKG showed nonspecific ST-segment changes. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest was performed  which confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection.   The patient was immediately put on intravenous antihypertensive therapy to control blood pressure and prepare for emergency surgery. Despite the high risks associated with surgery in patients with aortic dissection  the mortality associated with untreated aortic dissection is even higher. Given the patient’s clinical condition  it was determined that the benefits of emergency surgery outweighed the risks. The family was informed about the condition and provided consent to move forward with the surgery.   The patient was stabilized through surgery  and has since been encouraged to make significant lifestyle changes such as quitting tobacco and alcohol  keeping a balanced diet  and controlling hypertension.  Impression: This case illustrates the importance of immediate recognition and treatment of aortic dissection  as it is a life-threatening medical emergency. Treating chronic conditions like persistent hypertension is essential in preventing such acute events. This case also emphasizes the significance of lifestyle changes to prevent recurrence."

He's a retired IT specialist  married  non-smoker  drinks a glass or two of wine occasionally and does regular physical exercises though moderately intense.  Past medical history:   Mr. Alan has a history of hypertension for the last 15 years  which is usually controlled with Lisinopril  occasionally exacerbated by stress. He also has hyperlipidemia and is on statin medication. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes five years ago which is controlled with metformin. Additionally  he has mild osteoarthritis in his knees. No known allergies are reported.  Family History:  He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases — his father passed away at the age of 52 due to a heart attack and his elder brother had a triple bypass surgery at an early age of 55.  Current Hospital Course:  On presentation  he was tachycardic with a pulse rate of 120 bpm  his blood pressure was 180/110 mm Hg which was unequal in both arms. An EKG was performed which showed no signs of an acute myocardial infarction. However  chest X-ray showed a widened mediastinum. Subsequent CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis of an aortic dissection.  Management:  Given the presentation and scans  Mr. Alan was diagnosed with Stanford Type A aortic dissection  which is an emergency situation. He was immediately started on beta-blockers to reduce the pulse pressure on the walls of the aorta and sodium nitroprusside to control the elevated blood pressure. He underwent an emergency surgery – replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve which was successful.  After his surgery  he was sent to the ICU for post-operative monitoring. He has shown good recovery and has been transferred to a regular ward as of now.  Plan:  Mr. Alan will need to remain on strict blood pressure control and follow up care to monitor his condition. He will require a strong emphasis on lifestyle modifications to control his risk factors and avoid complications in the future. Patient education regarding the critical nature of medication compliance  signs of potential complications such as recurrent chest pain  and the importance of regular follow-up care will also be essential.   Considering his family history of heart disease and his own history of chronic hypertension  his family members should also be advised on regular screenings and lifestyle modifications to reduce cardiovascular risks.

Peripheral pulses were equal and similar in all 4 limbs.   Investigations:  Owing to the severity of pain  high BP  and typical nature of the chest pain  a suspicion of aortic dissection was quickly raised. An urgent CT-Angiogram was ordered which revealed an acute aortic dissection  Stanford type B  starting just after the artery's exit from the heart and extending into the descending thoracic aorta.  Management:  The patient was quickly stabilized and medical therapy was initiated to control blood pressure and heart rate. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and it was decided  given the type of dissection  to pursue conservative management first. The patient was admitted to the ICU for vigilant monitoring.   Family history: Father died at the age of 65 due to lung cancer ; Mother at 78 due to old age; One sibling with no known health conditions. The patient has 2 children  both of whom are healthy.  In conclusion  Mr. Doe's case presents a classic example of aortic dissection  instantly recognizable by severe  tearing chest pain. Quick diagnosis and proper management are vital in these cases. Despite the high-risk nature of this condition  with the patient's good overall health and blood pressure control  prognosis can be quite favorable. Regular follow-ups would be required to monitor the size of the dissection and blood pressure control.
11,9,83,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial83,"Patient Identifier: Mr. A Gender: Male Age: 65 years old Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired office worker  PRESENTING COMPLAINT: Mr. A presented to the emergency department with sudden  severe chest pain that began approximately four hours prior to arrival. He described the pain as """"tearing"""" in nature  which radiates from his chest to his back.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Mr. A has a known history of high blood pressure  controlled with Lisinopril. He also reported to have been a former smoker  having quit smoking 10 years ago after a span of 30 years of 1 pack per day.  FAMILY HISTORY: In terms of family history  the patient reported his father passing away in his early seventies from a heart attack and his mother died of dementia in her late eighties. He has a younger brother with Type II Diabetes.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon physical examination  Mr. A appeared sweaty and in distress due to pain. His blood pressure measurements were unequal between arms (right: 145/90 mmHg  left: 170/95 mmHg). Heart rate was regular but rapid at 110 bpm and respiratory rate was 20 bpm.  INVESTIGATIONS: Electrocardiogram showed evidence of left ventricular strain but no signs of myocardial infarction. A chest X-Ray showed a widened mediastinum. Subsequently  a CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of aortic dissection  showing a dissection starting just after the aortic arch and extending down to the abdominal aorta.  TREATMENT: Mr. A was admitted to the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit. He was given intravenous beta blockers to control his heart rate and blood pressure and analgesics for pain. He was planned for an emergent surgical repair of the dissection.  SUMMARY: Mr. A is a 65-year-old male with hypertension and a smoking history who presented with acute onset of chest pain. His presentation  physical exam findings  and radiological investigations are consistent with aortic dissection. He is managed conservatively whilst undergoing emergent surgical repair.  PROGNOSIS: While aortic dissection is a serious and life-threatening condition  immediate surgical intervention and appropriate medical management  as instituted in Mr. A's case  can improve survival rates significantly. However  his prognosis will depend on various factors including timely procedural success and management of his hypertension in the longer term. It will also be vital for him to avoid smoking and manage stress to prevent further cardiovascular complications."
11,9,84,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial84,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. K is a 65-year-old African-American male who was brought to the emergency department with an abrupt onset of severe chest pain. The English teacher described the pain as """"tearing"""" and radiated to his back  rated it 10 on a scale of 10. His pain started while watching the news on the sofa at home. Mr. K has a history of uncontrolled hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and a 20-pack year smoking history but had quit five years back. He has no history of diabetes or heart disease but had a grandfather with an “unknown heart condition.” current medications include Lisinopril and Atorvastatin.   Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. K was observed to be in distress due to pain. He was afebrile and his blood pressure reading was found to be raised (210/115 mmHg). His pulse rate was regular but accelerated at 98/min  respiratory rate 22/min and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. On lung auscultation  breath sounds were normal bilaterally; the cardiac examination revealed the presence of a diastolic murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation. Examination of his pulses showed discrepancy between upper and lower limbs.   Investigations & Diagnosis: Mr. K underwent an urgent CT angiography due to his severe chest pain and hypertension which revealed an aortic dissection starting just after the aortic root and extending to the renal arteries. Laboratory data revealed a slight increase in white blood cells but otherwise normal including cardiac enzymes.   Management: Given the type of aortic dissection (Stanford type A)  Mr. K was immediately transferred for emergency surgical repair to prevent impending rupture. Concurrently  his blood pressure was controlled preoperatively with intravenous labetalol for rate control and sodium nitroprusside to decrease the afterload thereby reducing the sheer stress on the aortic wall.   Discussion: Mr. K's case is typical of aortic dissection  which is often characterized by severe  sudden chest pain radiating to the back  often described as """"tearing."""" Key risk factors for aortic dissection include hypertension  age  cigarette smoking  and family history of heart conditions. Besides  the presence of aortic regurgitation murmur and pulse discrepancies are classic physical examination findings  which supported the initial clinical suspicion. Prompt recognition of this life-threatening condition and initiation of appropriate management is essential in determining outcomes."
11,9,85,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial85,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Davis  is a 62-year-old Caucasian male  who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden severe chest pain described as “tearing” that started in his anterior chest and radiated to his back. He also reports episodes of dizziness and shortness of breath  but no syncope or loss of consciousness. His BP was 180/120 mmHg in the right arm and 150/100 mmHg in the left arm.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Davis has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past 20 years. He has been non-compliant with his antihypertensive medications due to the lack of symptoms. He reports occasional tobacco use and social drinking but denies drug abuse. He has no history of hospitalization or surgery and no known allergies.  Family History:  His late father had a history of cardiovascular disease  with coronary artery bypass graft surgery at the age of 70  who eventually died of a stroke. His mother passed away from breast cancer in her late 60s. He also has two elder brothers who are alive and well  both of whom have been diagnosed with hypertension but no family history of aortic dissection or other connective tissue diseases.  Demographics:  Mr. Davis is retired and lives with his wife in their matrimonial home. He previously worked in construction  a job demanding physically. After retirement  Mr. Davis earned his living as a part-time carpenter. He never travels and spent most of his time at home  especially post-retirement.   Physical Examination & Diagnostics:  On examination  his pulse was 110 beats/min and bilateral radial pulses were perceived. There were no clinical signs of Marfan syndrome or other connective tissue diseases. An immediate EKG showed no signs of myocardial ischemia. The chest x-ray showed a widened mediastinum. A portable echocardiogram in the ED revealed a dissection flap in the ascending aorta. A subsequent CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of a Stanford type A aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta and arch.  Discussion:  The sudden chest pain and differing blood pressure readings between the arms raised the suspicion of an acute aortic dissection. The diagnosis was further strengthened by the finding of widened mediastinum on the Chest X-ray and confirmed with CT angiography. Given his history of uncontrolled hypertension  it is concluded that this likely contributed to his developing an aortic dissection.   Management and Plan:  Mr. Davis's condition is critical and requires immediate surgical intervention. The surgical team was alerted and prompt measures were initiated to control his blood pressures using intravenous medication. His next of kin were informed about his critical condition and the requirement for emergency surgery. An informed consent was obtained.

The sudden onset of intense  sharp discomfort was something he had never experienced before.  Examination Findings:  On physical examination  he had blood pressure discrepancies between both arms and a weak pulse in the right upper limb. Auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation. Pertinent lab results included an elevated D-dimer and increasing creatinine levels.  Imaging and Diagnosis:  Chest CT angiography showed an aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta  descending aorta  and involving the renal arteries. Based on the DeBakey classification  the patient had a Type I aortic dissection.   Past Medical History:  The patient has had a history of poorly controlled hypertension and high cholesterol. The longstanding hypertension appears to have played a key role in this event. He is a non-smoker who lives a relatively sedentary lifestyle. He had previously been diagnosed with obesity but had not undertaken any targeted interventions to lose weight.  Family History:  The patient has a strong family history of cardiac diseases. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60  and his elder brother had a stroke last year.  Management Plan:  Currently  the patient is being managed with beta-blockers and vasodilators to control his blood pressure and alleviate stress on the aorta. He was also started on statins for his cholesterol. However  the dissection type should be managed surgically. Therefore  the vascular surgery team was consulted to evaluate the patient for a potential hybrid repair or open surgical replacement of the aorta.   Education and Prevention:  Patient education will be critical in this case. Poor control of hypertension played a major role in the development of his aortic dissection. Comprehensive patient education on the importance of adherence to hypertension medication  lifestyle modifications  and regular follow-ups needs to be a part of the case management plan.
11,9,97,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial97,Patient Presentation:   Mr. A is a 69-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of severe chest pain described as 'tearing' in nature  which radiated to his back. He also reported shortness of breath. His medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is a retired school teacher  non-smoker  and occasional alcohol drinker. He has no known allergies.  Past Medical History:  The patient has a confirmed history of moderate hypertension  controlled through a prescribed antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril). His blood pressure readings range from 140/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg. He also has hyperlipidemia and was following dietary modification and taking statins for the same. There is no previous history of cardiac diseases  surgeries  or any other significant medical conditions.   Family History:  There is a positive history of cardiac diseases in his family. His father suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 73 and mother had hypertensive heart disease. He has two siblings; an elder sister with diabetes mellitus and a younger brother who is healthy.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  Mr. A appeared uncomfortable and diaphoretic. His blood pressure was 175/100 mmHg  heart rate of 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. On auscultation  his heart sounds were found to be normal with no murmur. His pulses were equal bilaterally.  Investigations:  Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Cardiac enzymes were ordered in the ED. ECG showed no evidence of ischemia or infarction. His cardiac enzymes came back normal. Given the severity of his pain and his high-risk profile  the ED physician ordered a CTA (Computed tomography angiography)  which revealed an ascending aortic dissection from the aortic root to the aortic arch.   Clinical Course:  The Cardiothoracic surgery team was promptly consulted  and beta-blockers were initiated for blood pressure control. He was immediately transferred to the operating room for an emergency surgical intervention - A Bentall procedure. The patient tolerated the surgery well  post-operative recovery was uneventful  and he was eventually discharged to a rehab facility.   Conclusion:  This case underscores the critical importance of prompt recognition and management of aortic dissection given the high mortality rate associated with it  particularly in patients with significant risk factors like hypertension and a family history of cardiac conditions.

11,9,100,diagnosis11-prompt9-trial100,Title: Acute Aortic Dissection Case Study   Case Presentation:  The patient is Mr. Howard  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  who was admitted to the emergency department with severe  sharp chest pain radiating to the back  an immediate cause for concern. The pain onset was sudden and began while he was mowing his lawn. He has been in good health until this episode  with no noticeable symptoms of malaise or discomfort. He does not smoke or drink alcohol.   Past medical history:  Mr. Howard was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago  for which he has been taking antihypertensive medications regularly. However  there's evidence of poor blood pressure control. His baseline BP often lingers around 150/95 mmHg. He also has Type II diabetes mellitus  which has been managed with metformin for 10 years  but his compliance to a prescribed diet and glucose checking has been inconsistent.   Family history:  His father died of a myocardial infarction at 72  and his mother had a stroke at 70. He also has a younger brother who was diagnosed with an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Presenting complaints: Mr. Howard presents with severe chest pain  shortness of breath  and an impending sense of doom. The pain is described as sharp and tearing  not relieved by nitroglycerin. His vitals show increased BP (185/105) and pulse is around 90 beats/min.   Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  the patient looked anxious  with profuse perspiration. Blood pressure measurements varied significantly between both arms. His cardiovascular exam revealed a discrepancy in peripheral pulses.  Investigations:  A chest X-ray was conducted  which suggested mediastinal widening and deviation of trachea. Further suspicion of aortic dissection led to a CT angiogram of the aorta  confirming a type A aortic dissection extending from the aortic root down to the iliac arteries.  Management: Mr. Howard's acute presentation  clinical findings  and radiological evidence were discussed urgently with cardiothoracic surgery for emergent surgical intervention. He was medically managed with intravenous beta-blockers (labetalol) and nitroprusside drip to control his blood pressure while arrangements were made for surgery.  This case presentation outlines a classic acute aortic dissection scenario  stemmed from poorly managed hypertension. It highlights the importance of immediate investigation and intervention to prevent fatal complications such as acute heart failure  aortic valve regurgitation and cardiac tamponade.

Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension  which he's been managing for the past 15 years with a beta-blocker and a thiazide diuretic. He's also a Type II diabetic  controlled with metformin  since the last 5 years. Additionally  he has hyperlipidemia  for which he's prescribed a statin. The patient occasionally experiences mild angina which is managed with nitroglycerin.  Key Complaints: The patient presents to the emergency department complaining of a sudden and extremely sharp ripping pain in the center of his chest radiating to his back  between the shoulder blades. The pain started when he was climbing stairs at his home. He describes it as the worst pain he's ever felt. No associated complaints of shortness of breath  palpitations  dizziness  fever  or any change in consciousness. The patient also mentions that he was not able to control his blood pressure properly in the last week although he had been compliant with his medication.  This severe  sharp chest pain likely represents a classic presentation of aortic dissection  which is often described by patients as """"tearing"""" or """"ripping"""" in nature. High blood pressure could have weakened his aortic wall  making it prone to splitting or dissection. Uncontrolled blood pressure in the last week might have added to the risk. Given that the patient did not lose consciousness  type A aortic dissection (affecting the ascending aorta) could be probable; however  further evaluation and imaging are required to confirm it."

11,10,79,diagnosis11-prompt10-trial79,"Case Report: Aortic Dissection  Patient Demographics: Patients' Initials: J.D. Age: 63 Sex: Male Race/Ethnicity: African-American  Past Medical History: J.D. has a known history of hypertension for over two decades  poorly controlled and inconsistently compliant with medications. He has a heavy smoking history of 1.5 packs a day for 45 years. He suffers from type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia for which he is on medication. He underwent an uncomplicated coronary artery bypass graft surgery 3 years ago.  Key Complaints: J.D. presented to the emergency department with sudden  intense chest pain described as a severe 'tearing' sensation  radiating to the back between the shoulder blades. The onset of this pain coincided with an argument he had at home. It was aggravated by physical activity and relieved slightly by rest. He also complained of increasing shortness of breath. On arrival  he seemed pale  diaphoretic  and appeared to be in considerable distress. His blood pressure was noted to be significantly high with different readings in both arms. His pulse was rapid and irregular. No significant changes were noted on the EKG.  This case presentation thus clearly indicates a sudden onset chest discomfort in a patient with several risk factors for aortic dissection  including inadequately treated hypertension  smoking status  history of coronary artery disease  and a likely triggering event leading to blood pressure surge. His complaints of a """"tearing"""" pain radiating to the back is typical for aortic dissection  as are his exam findings of high and different blood pressure readings in both arms. As aortic dissection is a critical and life-threatening condition  it is essential for medical students to understand its risks  presentations  and management to ensure quick identification and appropriate care."
11,10,80,diagnosis11-prompt10-trial80,Case Report:  Patient Information: Mr. James Campbell  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  presents to the emergency department.  Past Medical History: Mr. Campbell has a history of uncontrolled hypertension for the past ten years. He also has had high cholesterol levels and has been a heavy smoker for early three decades. He was also known to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for his chronic osteoarthritis.  Chief Complaints: The patient was brought in with complaints of sudden severe chest pain radiating to his back  along with onset of lightheadedness and clammy skin. He described the pain as a ‘tearing’ type and stated it started while he was lifting heavy boxes.  The onset  intensity  type  and radiation of pain should all make a medical student aware of the possibility of an aortic dissection. The past history of uncontrolled blood pressure  smoking  use of NSAIDs  and abnormal cholesterol levels all contribute to making this a high-probability case. Additionally  the sudden onset of symptoms  especially while the patient was involved in activities like heavy lifting  should raise immediate concern about an acute cardiovascular event. Consider patient's age and other risk factors as well.
