13,1,1,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial1,Patient Presentation:  We are examining a male patient named John Smith  born on January 15th  2022. He is currently 7 months old  of Caucasian ethnicity  and his family resides in Boston  Massachusetts. He was born at full term with normal birth weight. His initial stages of development were regular  with no reported early childhood illnesses or developmental anomalies.  Regarding family history  there are no known instances of congenital heart disease (CHD) or other significant hereditary conditions. His parents are non-smokers and have no history of substance abuse. Prenatal scans of the patient didn't reveal any congenital abnormalities.  Despite regular feeding patterns  John has been experiencing problematic weight gain and persistent respiratory infections since he was 4 months old. Upon further investigation  a heart murmur was discerned during an early routine check-up.  John's symptoms  specifically the failure to thrive and regular bouts of respiratory infections  suggested a potential cardiac problem. Hence  the pediatrician referred him to a pediatric cardiologist. A detailed cardiac evaluation was performed. The echocardiogram results indicated the presence of a congenital heart defect  specifically ventricular septal defect (VSD).  John hasn't had any previous surgeries or other medical complications. No known allergies have been reported. He is currently not on any medications except for multivitamins. His immunizations are up-to-date as per his age.  Overall  John represents a typical case of a pediatric patient with a congenital heart disease  specifically a VSD. Swift diagnosis and early intervention in such patients are critical to improve their quality of life and prevent severe complications in the future. The next course of action for John will involve a discussion with the cardiology team regarding the best strategy for his condition - be it surgical or medical management.
13,1,2,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial2,Subject: Congenital Heart Disease Patient Presentation  Demographics: Patient Name: T Smith Age: 3 years old Gender: Male Birthdate: December 8th  2017 Race: African American Insurance: Medicaid  Presenting Problem: 3-year old T Smith  is presenting with a suspected case of congenital heart disease. The child’s mother first noticed symptoms when T Smith developed an inexplicable fatigue and shortness of breath during simple playtime activities when compared to his peers of the same age.   Past Medical History: T Smith was born full term  with a birth weight of 3.25 kgs and no complications. According to the records  T Smith received all the immunizations for his age group. There is no history of severe illness or hospitalization in the past. His developmental milestones are in line with his age except for some slight delays in gross motor skills which might be related to his current cardiac condition.  Family History: The family history reveals no genetic disorders  but T Smith's paternal grandfather had myocardial infarction and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting at the age of 55 years.  Social History: T Smith has been living in a smoke-free environment with his parents who are both fit and non-smokers. He attends daycare twice a week.   Physical Examination: Upon examining the chest  a soft systolic murmur was identified. He also appeared slightly cyanotic when crying. The rest of the examination  including lung auscultation  the abdominal exam  and extremity examine  were normal.   Based on this  a referral for an echocardiogram is recommended to confirm the suspected diagnosis of CHD  possibly Tetralogy of Fallot due to the presentation of cyanosis and a systolic murmur.   It is necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis and begin appropriate treatment to prevent further complications. This will involve a multidisciplinary team including a pediatric cardiologist  cardiac surgeon  and geneticist given the high heritability rate of CHD.
13,1,3,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial3,Patient Presentation:  Our patient is Ava  a female Caucasian infant who recently celebrated her first birthday. Ava was born in Denver  Colorado  and this is her third visit to our institution since her birth.  Emily  Ava's 35-year-old mother  carried to term without complications. Emily reported regular prenatal care  and has a significant medical history of asthma and slight gestational diabetes during her pregnancy with Ava. There were no peripartum complications.   Ava appeared well until she was four months old  when her parents started to notice she was feeding poorly and growing slower than her peers. She exhibited shortness of breath and was often fatigued. These symptoms led to an initial evaluation by a pediatrician  who discovered a heart murmur upon auscultation.  Upon further testing  Ava has been diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart disease  making her one in approximately 2500 children born with this condition in the United States annually. This disorder consists of four heart defects: ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy and an overriding aorta.   Ava's medical history indicates that she hasn't had any allergies thus far. Concurrent past issues include a minor skin infection at 8 months  which was treated promptly with antibiotics and healed with no complications. She has received all her immunizations relevant to her age  according to the CDC's immunization schedule. Her growth and milestones have been retarded due to her heart condition with notably poor weight gain  and some delay in reaching her motor milestones.   Family history reveals no known congenital disorders or heart conditions. Ava's mother  father  and her older brother have good health overall.   Ava's management plan includes surgical correction to repair the underlying heart defects that make up Tetralogy of Fallot  she will need close follow-ups and lifelong monitoring  even after successful surgery.  This concludes Ava’s health summary and outlook.
13,1,4,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial4,Slide 1: Introduction & Demographic Information  Title: Case Presentation: A Pediatric Case of Congital Heart Disease (CHD)  The patient under evaluation is a three-year-old male child  of African American ethnicity  hailing from New York. He was brought in by both parents due to episodes of shortness of breath and fatigue mainly observed during playtime.   Slide 2: Past Medical History  The patient was born full term via C-section without any reported complications during birth. He was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot shortly after birth during routine neonatal screening. At 1-year-old  a complete repair of Tetralogy of Fallot was accomplished via open-heart surgery. The postoperative period was uneventful  and the child had been symptom-free until recent complaint. The patient does not have any other significant medical problems. He has received all his immunizations according to the CDC recommendations. No known allergies  and no medications are being taken at the present moment.   Slide 3: Family Background  No significant history of any heart disease  hypertension  or sudden death in the family. The parents are non-consanguineous with no other children. The parents are not aware of any such condition in their respective families.  Slide 4: Social History  The patient lives with both parents. He attends a local daycare center. No known exposure to smoking  alcohol  or illicit substances.   Slide 5: Discussion & Summary  In conclusion  we have a 3-year-old African American male child with a past surgical history of repaired Tetralogy of Fallot  now presenting with shortness of breath and fatigue during playtime. This presentation suggests the possible recurrence of symptoms related to CHD or any complications associated with previous surgery. Prompt evaluation and intervention are required to manage the patient’s situation for preventing any further comorbidity.
13,1,5,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial5,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Congital Heart Disease  Patient: Miss Lily Thompson  Age: 12 years old  Gender: Female  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Residence: Nashville  Tennessee  USA  Presenting Issue: Lily has been noticeably displaying symptoms related to potential heart issues  such as fatigue  shortness of breath  especially during physical activities  and blue coloration around the mouth and tips of fingers and toes.  Background: Lily was born with Down Syndrome  which is known to carry a higher risk of congenital heart defects. She has been under paediatric care with a primary focus on managing her chromosomal disorder  focusing on physical therapy  and early childhood education.  Medical History: At birth  Lily was diagnosed with Atrioventricular Septal defect (AVSD)  which is a form of congenital heart disease. She underwent heart surgery at six months after birth which corrected the large holes in her heart and also repaired her heart valves. Her heart condition has been routinely monitored since and her last cardiac evaluation was 1 year ago. Additionally  her Down Syndrome has also caused mild hearing loss  and she has low muscle tone  common in patients with Down Syndrome.  Family History: No immediate family history of congenital heart disease  though her mother has been diagnosed with Mitral Valve Prolapse. Diane  her mother  is also asthmatic.  Social History: Lily attends a school for children with special educational needs and participates in adapted physical activities. Her diet is generally balanced and her BMI is within normal limits. She lives with her mother who is her primary caregiver.  In summary  diagnosing and managing Lily's congenital heart disease has been complicated due to her Down Syndrome. However  her condition has improved post-surgery and with ongoing outpatient follow-ups. Despite her health challenges  Lily has been able to participate in various activities and maintain a high quality of life.
13,1,6,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial6,Patient Presentation:   Mr. John Smith  a 30-year-old Caucasian male with no significant past medical history  presented to the clinic. His primary complaint was persistent fatigue  especially after moderate physical activities. He also reported occasional episodes of palpitations.   Family History:   Smith has a family history of congenital heart defects. His mother was born with an atrial septal defect  which was surgically corrected in her youth.  Current demographics:   Mr. Smith is single and lives in the city outskirts. He is employed as a software engineer. He denies smoking and recreational drug usage but reports social drinking on the weekends. He maintains a balanced diet and regularly exercises (30 minutes walk daily).   Physical examination:   Mr. Smith appeared comfortable at rest but easily winded with minimal exertion. With a BMI of 24  he is within normal weight. His vital signs upon presentation were: pulse rate - 108 beats per minute  blood pressure - 130/86 mmHg  respiratory rate - 16 breaths per minute  and temperature - 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Cardiac examination revealed a continuous murmur best heard at the left sternal border.  Impression:   Given the family history of congenital heart disease  Mr. Smith's symptoms could suggest an undiagnosed congenital cardiac condition. Further diagnostic evaluations  such as EKG and echocardiograms  are warranted to investigate potential structural heart defects.   It is crucial to keep in mind  even though congenital heart diseases are usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood  some milder forms might go unnoticed until adulthood.
13,1,7,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial7,Patient Presentation:  I am presenting a 7-month-old Caucasian male infant who is a new patient in our clinic  referred by a local pediatrician due to signs indicative of congenital heart disease.  Demographic Information:  Patient's name is undisclosed due to privacy reasons. The infant lives with his parents and older sister aged 4 in the suburbs of New York  USA. His family history indicates no congenital diseases from either maternal or paternal lineages.  Past Medical History:  The child had a normal delivery at 38 weeks gestation with no complications reported during the prenatal and perinatal period. Birth weight and height were within normal range. His mother reported she had a regular prenatal care during her pregnancy  with no illnesses or complications recorded. She confirmed she did not smoke  drink alcohol or use illicit drugs during her pregnancy.   While carrying out a regular check-up  the pediatrician observed poor weight gain in spite of the infant having a normal feeding pattern and appetite. Also  the child's breathing rate was noticed to be faster than the normal and development was lagging slightly behind similar aged peers. A murmur was also detected during cardiac auscultation.  The child does not have any known allergies and has received his immunizations according to the recommended schedule.  Due to above findings  patients’ pediatrician requested an echocardiogram  which raised suspicion of a possible congenital heart disease. There was an evidence of right ventricular enlargement with tricuspid valve thickening  suggesting possible Tetralogy of Fallot. Further diagnostic work-up is pending for confirmation.  This brief summary establishes the necessity of a comprehensive cardiac workup for the patient  to confirm the diagnosis and start appropriate treatment and management plan. This will enable us to provide the necessary intervention and targeted therapy to improve our patient’s health outcomes.
13,1,8,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial8,Patient Presentation  Demographics:   Our patient is a 1-month old Caucasian male infant  born full-term via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery  to a 27-year-old gravida 2  Para 1 mother. He resides in Chicago  Illinois with his parents and has no siblings.  Presenting Symptoms:   He is brought to the hospital by his parents due to episodes of shortness of breath  bluish coloration of the skin (cyanosis)  and difficulties during feeding. The onset of these symptoms was gradual and the parents report that they noticed mild cyanosis soon after birth which has progressed.   Past Medical History:   The past medical history is significant. The antenatal period was uneventful with the mother having had regular prenatal check-ups. However  on obstetric ultrasonography there was a suspicion of a cardiac anomaly which couldn't be confirmed due to lack of advanced screening facilities at the mother's primary care clinic.  Family History:  There is no known history of congenital heart disease in the family.   Clinical Assessment:   Based on the initial presentation and health history  the baby is suspected to have congenital heart disease. An echocardiogram  chest X-ray  and an ECG have been planned for further evaluation. The most likely differential diagnoses at this point include Tetralogy of Fallot  Transposition of the Great Vessels  or other types of cyanotic congenital heart diseases. Immediate hospital admission for continuous monitoring has been recommended due to the severity of symptoms. The parents have been counselled about the possible outcomes and therapeutic strategies  including possible surgical intervention.   In summary  this is a case of a 1-month old male infant presenting with features suggestive of possible congenital heart disease  with an unknown subtype. Further workup is undergoing. An early diagnosis and appropriate management are critical for improving the prognosis and quality of life of the patient. 
13,1,9,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial9,Patient Presentation:   Our patient is an infant boy  named John  aged 6 weeks  of Asian ethnicity. He's the firstborn in a family of young parents in their late twenties  residing in San Francisco  California.   Presenting Complaints:   John's parents brought him in due to signs of poor feeding  difficulty in breathing  and frequent episodes of bluish skin discoloration notably around the mouth and fingertips.   Past Medical History:   This young patient was born full-term via vaginal delivery with an uneventful natal history. He didn't exhibit any immediate postnatal complications and received necessary vaccinations as per the schedule. John's parents reported that he had been experiencing difficulty in feeding and breathlessness after birth  but these symptoms have intensified over the last few weeks.  Family History:   John's mother had a normal pregnancy and there's no family history of heart disease. But there is  however  a family history of diabetes on the maternal side.   Physical Examination:  Upon examination  John was found cyanosed with his lips and fingertips exhibiting a bluish tint. Cardiac auscultation revealed a heart murmur. He had noticeable difficulty in feeding and showed signs of breathlessness even while at rest. His weight gain has been far below the normal range for his age group.  In conclusion  considering John’s symptoms and physical examination findings  Congenital Heart Disease is being considered as a working diagnosis. Further diagnostic tests  including an echocardiogram  would need to be done to confirm it. A detailed plan of management would be set up based on findings from these investigations. Community health resources and medical assistance programs will be explored on behalf of the family to ensure the best possible care for John.
13,1,10,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial10,Title: Presentation of Congital Heart Disease in a Pediatric Patient  Patient Profile: Patient X is a 4-month-old infant girl of Hispanic ethnicity  brought in by her parents for regular check-up. She weighs 6 kg and is in the 50th percentile for her weight  with a length at the 50th percentile as well. She was born full term with no complications during delivery.   Presenting Complaint:  The parents express concern over the baby's apparent difficulties with feeding  noticing that she often becomes sweaty and breathless during nursing. They also report that she seems to tire easily and has less activity compared to other infants her age.   Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with Down Syndrome a week after birth. She has a documented history of mild jaundice that resolved without intervention in the first week of life and an incomplete intestinal rotation  which has been surgically corrected at 2 months of age. She has been frequently visiting the pediatrician due to recurrent respiratory infections since she was 2-months-old.   Family History: Her father has type 2 diabetes and her maternal aunt has an atrial septal defect  a type of congenital heart disease. There is no family history of other types of congenital malformations  genetic disorders or any known exposure to environmental teratogens.   Summary:  Overall  based on the patient's symptoms  past medical history and family history  there is a concern for potential congenital heart disease  possibly associated with her Down Syndrome. Further diagnostic workup  such as echocardiograms and other cardiovascular imaging studies  will be sought to substantiate this working diagnosis  establish the exact cardiac anomaly and to guide the management plan onward.
13,1,11,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial11,I. Introduction  Good afternoon. I'll be presenting a case involving Congenital Heart Disease.   II. Demographic Information  Our patient is a six-month-old infant named Jane. She was born full-term with a birth weight of 3.5 kilograms and is of Caucasian ethnicity. Jane and her family are from Oklahoma City.  III. Past Medical History  Jane's prenatal history was unremarkable without any exposure to drugs  alcohol  or tobacco. There were no maternal infections or illnesses documented during pregnancy. No family history of congenital heart disease is reported.   IV. Present Illness  About a month ago  Jane's parents started noticing symptoms suggestive of heart problems. This includes shortness of breath  poor feeding  excessive sweating  and recurrent chest infections  all of which are signs of potential heart issues. Consequently  Jane failed to gain weight and was experiencing issues with her overall development.  V. Diagnosis  On physical examination  Jane had restricted growth  with her weight only at the 3rd percentile for her age. On auscultation  a murmur was heard  suggesting a potential structural heart defect. Her oxygen saturation levels were consistently low  around 85%.   Subsequent diagnostic testing  specifically an echocardiogram  revealed structural abnormalities in her heart. Jane was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart disease which includes four heart defects.   VI. Current Treatment   Jane is currently on digoxin and furosemide to manage her heart failure symptoms and will soon undergo a corrective surgery for her condition. Her long-term prognosis will be discussed in consultation with a pediatric cardiologist.   In conclusion  congenital heart disease is a serious condition requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment. As physicians  we must watch for characteristic signs such as poor feeding  difficulty breathing  and failure to thrive in infants.  Taking prompt action can lead to positive outcomes such as in Jane's case.
13,1,12,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial12,Patient Presentation:  Patient Name: Baby Jane Age: 4 months old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Asian  The patient  Baby Jane  is a 4-month-old Asian female. She is being seen due to concerns about her consistent shortness of breath  failure to gain weight and sweating during feedings  which were noted by her parents. She has been previously hospitalised once for pneumonia when she was 2 months old.  Upon physical examination  there were noticeable signs of cyanosis  particularly in the lips and fingernails. A heart murmur was also detected during her auscultation  indicative of an abnormal blood flow within the heart.   In terms of family history  both parents are healthy with no reports of heart diseases or genetic disorders. However  they noted that Baby Jane’s maternal aunt had a “hole in her heart” at birth but was unsure of the specific diagnosis.  Given these symptoms  a diagnosis of a congenital heart disease (CHD) is strongly suspected. Additional tests including an echocardiogram and chest X-ray have been recommended to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific type of CHD Baby Jane might have. Congenital heart diseases are the most common type of birth defect  affecting approximately 1% of all live births worldwide.   Considering Baby Jane's age  parents were advised regarding the critical phase this condition plays in her growth & development. They were reassured that with technological advancements  infants and children with CHD have a better prognosis and most of the heart defects can be corrected or improved with intervention or surgery. Regular follow-ups have been scheduled to closely monitor Baby Jane’s progress.  It is crucial  at this stage  to provide comprehensive clinical care and parental education about Baby Jane’s condition to ensure her ongoing health needs are effectively met.
13,1,13,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial13,Slide 1: Patient Identification and Demographics Patient: Jack Smith Age: 6 months old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Residing: Charlotte  North Carolina  Slide 2: Birth and Family History Jack was born full-term via normal vaginal delivery showing no immediate health concerns. He is the first child to his non-consanguineous parents. Both parents are healthy with no known history of congenital diseases or significant health conditions.   Slide 3: Early Progress  Until two months of age  Jack was meeting developmental milestones just like any other newborn. His mother started noticing Jack looking pale and being overly tired after breastfeeding. He also began to gain weight slower than expected.   Slide 4: Initial Presentation  At 4 months old  Jack presented to the pediatrician with shortness of breath  excessive sweating  poor feeding  and slow growth. On examination  a heart murmur was detected. His pediatrician referred him to a pediatric cardiologist for further evaluation.  Slide 5: Investigations and Diagnosis A series of tests including chest X-ray  echocardiogram  and electrocardiogram were conducted that confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart disease.   Slide 6: Past Medical History Aside from congenital heart disease  Jack has no other prior medical history. He has not had any surgery  significant trauma  or a history of hospitalization.   Slide 7: Current Status Currently  Jack is under consultation for corrective heart surgery with pediatric cardiac surgeons. He is on medication to help manage his symptoms until the surgery can be performed.   Slide 8: Plan The plan involves corrective surgery in the coming months  regular follow-ups  and dedicated care with a focus on nutrition and growth. The goal is to help Jack lead a healthy and normal life post-surgery.    Final Slide: Conclusion With careful intervention and proper care  Jack has a good chance of leading a normal  healthy life despite his early diagnosis of congenital heart disease. Continued research in congenital heart diseases may further improve his prognosis in the future.
13,1,14,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial14,Slide 1: Introduction  Our case presentation involves a 9-month old Hispanic female named Clara Sanchez who has been diagnosed with congenital heart disease. She was born in San Francisco  California and lives with her parents. She has an older brother who is healthy.  Slide 2: Medical History   Clara was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) shortly after birth during a routine newborn screening  confirmed by echocardiogram. She's been followed up by a pediatric cardiologist and has been on prophylactic treatment with dioxin and Propranolol. No prior heart surgeries have been performed.   Slide 3: Antenatal and Postnatal History   Clara's mother had a normal pregnancy but did not have prenatal ultrasounds. There is no reported history of maternal diabetes  drug or alcohol use during pregnancy. Clara was born at term via normal vaginal delivery with no complications. There is no family history of congenital heart disease.   Slide 4: Present Issues   Recently  Clara has developed signs of 'tet spells' – episodes of deep blue skin  nails  and lips after crying or feeding  or upon waking from sleep. As per her records  Clara's growth parameters are below the 3rd percentile for her age which indicates failure to thrive.   Slide 5: Examination   Clara appeared cyanotic with a heart murmur heard on cardiac auscultation. The pulses are easily palpable. Her oxygen saturation level was 82%. No edema was observed.   Slide 6: Hypothesis  The main concern is worsening of the patient's Tetralogy of Fallot  which could cause an increase in right-to-left shunting resulting in 'tet spells' and failure to thrive.   Slide 7: Lab Tests and Imaging   Next steps will involve ordering a panel of labs including complete blood count  electrolytes  BNP  and cardiac enzymes. An echocardiogram will be repeated to understand the anatomy and function of the heart.   Slide 8: Management   Clara may require surgical intervention to correct the anatomical defects  which could significantly improve her symptoms and quality of life. She may also need nutritional support to address the issue of failure to thrive.   Slide 9: Conclusion   Some forms of congenital heart diseases  like the Tetralogy of Fallot  can have a significant impact on a child's growth and overall development. Early detection and management can significantly improve the prognosis. Our aim for Clara is to control her symptoms  improve her quality of life and support her growth and development.
13,1,15,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial15,Subject: Case Presentation of Patient with Congital Heart Disease  Patient Information: The patient is a 3-year-old African-American female child  currently residing in Los Angeles  California. She attends a local preschool and lives with both parents and a 5-year-old sibling.  Presenting Issue: The patient presents with cyanosis  fatigue  difficulty feeding  and failure to gain weight  which have been recurring over the last six months. These symptoms have gradually increased in severity. Her mother reports that the patient becomes blue during periods of activity and during feeding times. Besides  she has experienced bouts of fast and labored breathing. The patient's developmental milestones seem delayed compared to her older sibling at the same age.  Medical History: The patient was born at term with no complications during pregnancy or childbirth. Her birth weight and length were within the normal ranges.   At six months  her parents noticed that she was not gaining weight as expected  and she showed signs of fatigue during feeding. At that time  they presumed it was due to colic.   Over the next few months  the symptoms worsened with the development of cyanosis during activity and feeding. A Pediatric Cardiologist consultation was sought when the patient was 1-year-old. During the initial cardiac examination  a heart murmur was detected  leading to further cardiological evaluation where she was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot- a type of congenital heart disease.  Recent diagnostic tests show a unique combination of four heart defects: Ventricular septal defect (VSD)  Pulmonary stenosis  Right Ventricular Hypertrophy  and an Overriding aorta.  Family History: Both parents are in good health with no history of congenital heart disease or other inherited disorders. The patient’s sibling is also healthy.  Summary: In summary  we have a 3-year-old African-American female patient  diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart disease  presenting with symptoms of cyanosis  fatigue  feeding difficulty  and weight gain failure. Further examination and intervention are necessary to manage her condition for optimal outcome.
13,1,16,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial16,Title: Congenital Heart Disease Patient Presentation  Patient Demographics: Our patient  Mr. John Doe  is a 35-year-old Caucasian male  currently residing in Lincoln  Nebraska. He is gainfully employed as an attorney  putting in significant working hours. He doesn't smoke or use alcohol but admits to leading a sedentary lifestyle. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disorders.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Doe presents with increasing episodes of dyspnea on exertion over the past few months  which have significantly hampered his daily activities. He also reports episodes of palpitations and intermittent chest pain.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart disease characterized by four anatomical abnormalities of the heart  during infancy. These abnormalities include ventricular septal defect  pulmonic stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta. As a result of this diagnosis  he underwent corrective surgery during early childhood.  As a child and adolescent  he led an almost normal life with regular follow-ups with his cardiologist. However  adult-onset symptoms have begun to appear. He tested positive for pulmonary regurgitation  which is a long-term consequence after the surgical repair for Tetralogy of Fallot.   Subsequent to this  Mr. Doe was diagnosed with hypertension and has been on antihypertensive medication for the past eight years. Other than this  there have been no major illnesses or surgeries on record.  Conclusion: With the presenting complaints and given the past medical record of congenital heart disease  Mr. Doe’s case appears to be a long-term consequence of corrective surgery in TOF. The current line of approach should include a thorough cardiovascular assessment and appropriate interventional procedures as indicated.  Hence  it is crucial to emphasize Mr. Doe about lifestyle modifications that incorporate regular exercise and a heart-healthy diet. His condition would require a multidisciplinary approach and he needs to be educated about the importance of regular medical care.
13,1,17,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial17,Patient Presentation  Today  I would like to present the case of a 2-month-old female infant  named Jane Doe  of Hispanic ethnicity  who has presented with congenital heart disease. Jane was brought in by her mother who noticed symptoms of eating difficulties  poor weight gain  and rapid breathing. In addition  she also experienced excessive sweating and pale gray or bluish skin. She is from a non-smoking household.  The patient was full-term at birth with no significant complications  and the prenatal history was unremarkable. Her birth weight was 3.5 Kg and Apgar scoring was 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes  respectively. There is no significant family history of congenital anomalies  heart disease or any genetic condition. She’s been exclusively breastfed.  Past Medical History  Jane’s past medical history is notable for a murmur detected at her one-month well child checkup. The murmur was described as a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border. No additional heart sounds or rubs were noted.  Given the constellation of these symptoms – eating problems  poor growth  rapid breathing  excessive sweating  and unusual skin color – along with the cardiac murmur heard during the physical examination  we are indeed dealing with a probable case of a congenital heart defect  although additional diagnostic testing will be needed to confirm the type and severity of the condition.  It’s important to mention that early detection of congenital heart disease could greatly improve the infant’s health and survival rate  enabling appropriate treatment strategies and the potential for surgical intervention if required. As a healthcare provider  we aim to minimize the potential complications related to the disease and provide Jane and her family with effective and optimized care.  That’s all about Jane Doe’s case as of now  we will proceed with further investigation  and keep the plan of care dynamic as per the investigation outcomes.
13,1,18,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial18,Patient Presentation  Our patient is a 9-month-old Caucasian male  E.D.  born in a private hospital through normal vaginal delivery. He is presented today for a routine check-up and a follow-up about his heart condition.   Birth History: E. D.'s mother had a gestation period of 40 weeks with no preeclampsia  gestational diabetes  or prenatal viral infection reported. His birth weight was within the normal range but developed cyanosis shortly after birth.   Past Medical History: E.D. was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a form of congenital heart disease  only several weeks after birth due to the episodes of cyanosis and poor feeding. At 4 months old  E.D. underwent a successful corrective heart surgery to rectify the ventricular septal defect and relieve the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. There was no other hospitalization or surgery reported aside from this. Regular follow-ups have been maintained since the surgery  and the child has been on a prescribed regimen of medications  including aspirin to prevent clot formation.   Family history revealed that the child’s paternal uncle had a congenital heart disease as well  which was surgically corrected during early childhood. The patient's growth and development milestones have been on the right track following the surgical correction of the heart defect. He has started showing a proclivity towards eating solid foods. There are no known allergies  and the immunization is up to date as per the child’s age.  On physical examination  there is a surgical scar consistent with the previous heart surgery. There is no clubbing or cyanosis visible  and the S1 and S2 heart sounds are normal with no murmurs. His pulse rate  respiratory rate  and blood pressure readings are within the average range for his age.   In summary  E.D. is a 9-month-old Caucasian male with a known history of Tetralogy of Fallot  possibly linked to his family history of congenital heart disease. Currently  he is progressing well post-surgery and shows no signs of health detriments contributing to the condition. Regular follow-ups and medication adherence are crucial to E.D.'s continued prognosis and managing his congenital heart disease.
13,1,19,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial19,Patient Presentation:  I would like to present Mr. Lee Truong  a 30-year-old Asian male who was diagnosed with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) at birth. He was born in San Jose  California  where he has lived his entire life. Mr. Truong is a software engineer who leads a mostly sedentary lifestyle. His bio-data includes a known diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a condition that was identified shortly after his birth. To date  he has undergone a total of three corrective heart surgeries  all of which occurred before he turned 2 years old.    Throughout his years of self-management  Mr. Truong has made consistent minor lifestyle adjustments to accommodate his condition. He avoids strenuous physical activities and maintains a balanced diet primarily to prevent the onset of any potential comorbidities which might put a strain on his heart function. He continues to take his prescribed medication regularly which include beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors.   There is none significant family history of heart diseases. His parents and two siblings have no reported major health issues. He does not consume alcohol  tobacco  or recreational drugs. However  he has a history of anxiety linked  in part  to his heart condition which is being managed with cognitive behavioral therapy. Sleep is generally good; he gets an average of 7-8 hours per night.  His current clinical symptom includes a concerning increase in shortness of breath  dismissing it as results of his sedentary lifestyle and professional stress. However  it's essential to closely monitor to rule out cardiac or pulmonary issues that is known complication in adult with Congenital Heart Diseases. Regular follow-ups and cardiovascular assessment is done to monitor his overall heart health.  Considering the chronic nature of his condition  his overall management so far has been optimal. His latest echocardiogram shows a well functioning heart with preserved systolic function and no significant valvular disease. We continue to monitor his symptoms  emotional health and general well-being closely to provide the best possible healthcare and maintain his quality of life.
13,1,20,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial20,Title: Pediatric Presentation of Congital Heart Disease (CHD)  Patient Profile: Subject is a three-year-old male of Asian descent named Alan Wong  currently residing in downtown San Francisco  CA with his family. Alan has been under pediatric care since birth but has thus far not shown any significant history of major illnesses or disease. He has been brought up to date on all recommended vaccinations in accordance with CDC’s immunization schedule.  Medical Presentation: Alan's parents have recently noticed he becomes fatigued easily compared to children his age. He has rapid breathing after engaging in physical activity and occasional complaints of heart pounding. They also noticed incidental skin discoloration  primarily manifesting in a bluish tint around the mouth and fingertips  particularly when he is crying or active. Alan has also had slower weight gain compared to healthy children of the same age group  despite having a normal appetite.  Past Medical History: Alan was born post full-term (39 weeks) via a natural delivery with no complications at birth and no need for NICU admission. He has no prior surgeries or hospitalizations on record. He has had normal developmental milestones  with no major illnesses or respiratory issues. In terms of family history  his paternal grandmother has a known history of congenital heart disease but no other known incidence of the disease in the family. There is no history of chromosomal disorders in the family.  Based on Alan's presentation and family history  there is a suspicion of a possible congenital heart abnormality which needs to be evaluated thoroughly. Alan will be referred to a pediatric cardiologist for a detailed cardiac evaluation  including investigations such as an echocardiogram  electrocardiogram  and possibly cardiac MRI to reach a definitive diagnosis. The parents have been educated about the potential indications for these tests and the steps for further management depending on the outcomes.
13,1,21,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial21,Title: Presentation of a Pediatric Patient with Congital Heart Disease  Introduction:   We are discussing the case of a five-year-old female patient  Miss Emily Rogers  who is presenting with congenital heart disease (CHD). Emily is of Caucasian descent  residing in Pennsylvania with her parents who also happen to have no significant health-related issues.  Medical History:  Emily was born via a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at 38 weeks gestation. Her prenatal history was unremarkable with no maternal history of smoking  alcohol  or drug use during pregnancy. No family history of congenital heart diseases or any other cardiac diseases was reported.  Around her second year  Emily began showcasing symptoms of fatigue  poor weight gain  and frequent respiratory tract infections. Noticing her lag behind her peers in physical developmental milestones and fast breathing  the parents sought medical attention.   A physical examination revealed a continuous heart murmur  and further evaluation with transthoracic echocardiography showed a diagnosis of a ventricular septal defect (VSD)  a type of congenital heart disease. This defect allows oxygen-rich blood to mix with oxygen-poor blood  causing the heart to work harder to provide enough oxygen to the body's tissues.   Emily's growth parameters were found to be below average for her age. Her immunisations are up-to-date  and there are no known allergies. She was hospitalised twice due to pneumonia within the last two years.  Current Status:  Currently  Emily is under regular follow-up and is on medication to manage heart failure symptoms. Unfortunately  the ventricular septal defect has not shown spontaneous closure. Emily's parents have given consent for possible surgical intervention  now planned due to her frequent infections and growth retardation.  Conclusion:  Pediatric congenital heart disease  such as Emily's ventricular septal defect  remains a significant health issue requiring ongoing vigilance and possibly surgical intervention. Despite her diagnosis  Emily is in good spirits and enjoys playing with her dolls. Our care team is dedicated to ensuring the best possible quality of life for Emily and continuing support for her parents.
13,1,22,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial22,Patient Profile: Name: Jane Doe Age: 11 months Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Birthplace: Austin  Texas  Medical Presentation:  Jane Doe presents today with symptoms suggestive of a congenic heart disease (CHD). Jane was born full term without any immediate complications; however  signs of potential issues began showing around two months of age. The primary complaints have been poor feeding  inadequate weight gain  and a significant amount of lethargy.  Past health records indicate that she had recurring respiratory infections and frequent rapid breathing - symptoms that prompted initial medical investigations that suggested congenital heart disease. The family  first-time parents  have been extremely concerned with Jane's health since these early indicators.   Her growth parameters are consistently below average  with her existing at the third percentile for both height and weight for her age. She demonstrates pallor and mild cyanosis  notably more evident during feeding and crying. An inspection of her chest shows visible pulsations.  Based on echocardiogram findings  Jane was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a common type of congenital heart disease. The current examination detected a harsh systolic murmur on the left upper sternal border.  Family history demonstrated no evidence of congenital heart anomalies. Jane's 32-year-old mother had a healthy  full-term pregnancy  and there were no notable illnesses or use of medications during pregnancy. Jane's father  aged 33  is in good health. There are no other siblings.  Moving forward  our team has recommended Jane for cardiac surgery  which is usually the standard procedure in managing Tetralogy of Fallot. Preoperative care involving management of cyanotic spells and maintaining proper nutrition is essential. Our priority is to stabilize her condition and optimize her growth parameters for surgery.  In conclusion  Jane Doe is an 11-month-old who is showing significant signs that are consistent with diagnosed congenital heart disease. Printed and digital resources for the family on understanding and managing congenic heart disease will be very beneficial at this point. The team will continue to monitor her condition closely and provide support to her parents throughout this process.

Her treatment plan and prognosis will depend on the specific type of CHD diagnosed and its severity.
13,1,24,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial24,"Patient Presentation  Subject: A 6-month-old Male Patient Presenting Congenital Heart Disease  Demographic Information:  The patient is a six-month-old Caucasian male infant who resides with his biological parents in Seattle  Washington  USA. The patient’s family has no history of socio-economic disadvantage  and no other relevant social or environmental factors are known. The infant was birthed full-term after a relatively uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery.   Medical History: The infant was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect during a routine postnatal check-up. His Pediatrician had noticed a heart murmur during auscultation and subsequently referred him for a pediatric echocardiogram. The subsequent confirming diagnosis was Tetralogy of Fallot.  Tetralogy of Fallot encompasses four characteristic heart defects: a ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary outflow tract obstruction (pulmonary stenosis)  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta.   As part of his ongoing management  he has had regular check-ups to monitor his heart health  growth  and development. The infant has been feeding well and meeting most growth milestones appropriate for age. However  there have been occasional episodes of cyanosis  particularly associated with crying or feeding  known as """"Tet spells"""".   No other health concerns or diseases are present in the patient's history. His immunizations are up to date. The family history includes a paternal grandfather with a coronary artery disease and a maternal grandmother with hypertension. Otherwise  there is no known family history of congenital heart disease.   Previous Intervention: Before surgical correction  which is being considered around 6 to 12 months of age  the infant has been on beta-blockers (Propranolol) to reduce the frequency and severity of Tet spells. The family has been advised about the knee-chest position and calming maneuvers during such episodes.  Plan:  Due to the nature of the defect and the patient's age  surgical consult is being arranged to plan the timing of corrective surgery. The goal for the patient's management is to help him grow and develop normally and reduce the risk of complications associated with Tetralogy of Fallot. This encompasses comprehensive multidisciplinary specialist care  including cardiology  cardiothoracic surgery  dietetics  and developmental pediatrics."
13,1,25,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial25,Slide 1: Introduction Our patient today is a 3-month-old Caucasian female named Lily. She was born full term through normal delivery. There is no history of neonatal complications or immediate postnatal concerns.   Slide 2: Demographics Lily lives in a suburban community with her non-smoker parents and a 2-years-old sibling. Her home environment is smoke-free. Her parents report no known food or drug allergies.   Slide 3: Prenatal and Birth History Lily was born after an uneventful pregnancy without known exposure to any infections  drugs or alcohol. She was delivered at 39 weeks gestation with a birth weight of 3.2kg.  Slide 4: Past Medical History Lily was taken to her pediatrician at 2 months due to poor feeding and slow weight gain. During the consultation  a heart murmur was detected and subsequent investigations led to the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot.  Slide 5: Family History There is no known family history of congenital heart disease  sudden cardiac death or genetic disorders. Lily's elder sibling is healthy and has no health problems.  Slide 6: Current Clinical Presentation Lily continues to exhibit symptoms of poor feeding  slow weight gain  and she has been recently noted to show signs of shortness of breath and fatigue. Each feeding session is laborious and lasts longer than usual. A bluish tint around her mouth (cyanosis) is noticeable especially during crying or feeding.   Slide 7: Diagnosis Tetralogy of Fallot confirmed by echocardiogram. This congenital defect consists of four heart problems: a ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  a misplaced aorta  and a thickened right ventricular wall (right ventricular hypertrophy).  Slide 8: Treatment Plan Lily is referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further management. A complete repair of her heart defect through surgery is anticipated in the coming months  focusing initially on correcting the pulmonary stenosis and the ventricular septal defect.
13,1,26,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial26,Patient Presentation:  Miss Sarah Ross is a 2-week-old Caucasian female infant  presented to clinic accompanied by her parents. She was born after an uneventful pregnancy  labor and delivery  and there were no complications noted at birth. The subject of health concern is related to some distinct signs noticed by her parents which includes poor feeding  rapid breathing  pale grey or blue skin color  and swelling in legs  abdomen or around eyes. These signs instigated the parents to seek medical help  suspecting an underlying health issue.   In her two weeks of life  Sarah has not been hospitalized or had any previous surgeries. She has not been diagnosed with any allergies or food intolerance. Both mother and father deny any immediate family history of congenital heart disease or other genetic disorders  as well as any maternal drug or alcohol use during pregnancy.   Upon primary examination  pediatrician noted that Sarah has an increased work of breathing with intercostal retractions. On Cardiac examination  an abnormal heart rhythm and a heart murmur was also detected  raising the suspicion of a congenital heart defect. Further investigations are needed which include chest X-ray  pulse oximetry  Echocardiography  Cardiac Catheterization to confirm the diagnosis.  Congenital heart diseases are among the most common birth defects  affecting the structure and function of the newborn's heart. The outcome for these patients has significantly improved as medical and surgical treatments have advanced. However  these children will need continuous care and regular monitoring with a cardiologist well versed in congenital heart diseases.  For Sarah  further diagnostic studies and treatment strategies are planned following consultation with pediatric cardiology. Early detection and management will be the key in her case to avoid any severe future complications and to better manage her heart defect for living a healthy life.
13,1,27,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial27,Presentation  I present a male infant  aged three weeks  of Hispanic ethnicity  born in a local community hospital. His birth weight was 6.2 lbs.  and he was carried to full term. The delivery was uncomplicated  and both the Apgar scores were within the normal range. The parents are non-smokers and no history of drug  alcohol abuse or any infectious diseases during pregnancy. There is no family history of congenital diseases  heart disease  or sudden death. The baby is breastfeeding well  has been gaining weight  and has had appropriate bowel and urinary output.  Upon regular check-up  his pediatrician noticed a weak pulse in the lower extremities and a strong pulse in the right arm. Further examination revealed a slight cardiac murmur  poor feeding  easy fatigability  and episodes of rapid breathing. These symptoms led him to suspect a potential congenital heart disease  possibly Coarctation of the Aorta  which was then referred to our hospital for further assessment.  Past Medical History  This is the first offspring of the parents  who are both aged 25  and there were no complications or significant illnesses during the gestational period. The mother had regular antenatal check-ups  and three routine ultrasounds  all of which were reported as normal.   In the neonate's short lifespan  there is no previous hospitalization or surgery. His newborn metabolic screen was normal. At discharge following birth  no cardiac murmur was appreciated and his postnatal adaptation was deemed excellent. The findings leading to this congenital heart disease suspicion started manifesting only recently. Vaccinations are up-to-date for the age. There is no history of medication use  allergies or blood transfusions.

She is currently 2 weeks old and lives with her parents in Springfield. Jenny's parents have a middle-class background  her mother is a teacher and her father is a computer engineer. They are Non-Smokers with no history of substance or alcohol abuse.   II. Medical History:  Prenatal ultrasounds were unremarkable. The mother's pregnancy was well-managed with no history of infections  trauma  medications  alcohol  or drug use. The mother affirmed that she had attended all her prenatal appointments and had taken prenatal vitamins regularly.  III. Presenting Problems: On routine neonatal screening  Jenny was noted to have an unusual heart murmur prompting further assessment. This has led to her being referred for a pediatric cardiology consultation. Jenny has had worsening episodes of cyanosis  especially during feeding. She has also been feeding poorly and not gaining weight as expected for her age.   IV. Examination and Investigations Results: Physical examination of the baby has revealed a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur located at the left upper sternal border. Further investigations including chest radiograph  ECG and echocardiogram have confirmed the preliminary diagnosis of Congenital Heart Disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot.  V. Previous Treatments:  As Jenny is a neonate  there have been no previous interventions or treatments aside from the standard neonatal care.  A multidisciplinary approach to Jenny’s care is being set in place  involving a pediatric cardiologist  a pediatric cardiac surgeon  and a neonatologist ensuring comprehensive management of this complex condition.   NB: Tetralogy of Fallot is a combination of four congenital abnormalities. The four defects include a ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary valve stenosis  a misplaced aorta and a thickened right ventricular wall (right ventricular hypertrophy).

13,1,32,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial32,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Salazar  a 32-year-old male originating from Latino descent  presents with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). He is currently residing in Bronx  New York with his wife and a 2-year-old daughter.   Clinical History:  Mr. Salazar has a documented history of Tetralogy of Fallot  the most common type of cyanotic congenital heart defect  diagnosed soon after birth via echocardiography. He underwent corrective surgery at the age of 2 years which was successful  until now he has been leading a reasonably normal quality of life.   As part of the medical history associated with CHD  he was also diagnosed with pulmonary regurgitation (leakage of blood from pulmonary artery into right ventricle) at the age of 15 years and has been on medication since then.   Past Medical History: Relatively consistent and timely follow-ups reveal that Mr. Salazar has maintained a steady cardiac status post the intervention in his early years. However  he occasionally experiences arrhythmias and easy fatigability.   In terms of other health conditions  he is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic  does not have diabetes or any known genetic disorders. However  he was diagnosed with mild hypertension 2 years ago and has been on medication to control his blood pressure.  Overall  Mr. Salazar diligently adheres to his treatment plan and medications recommended by his cardiologist. Given the progressive nature of congenital heart diseases  he is recommended regular monitoring of his cardiac function tests along with an active lifestyle and balanced diet to manage his overall health condition effectively.   Family History: His family history is significant  with close relatives (an uncle) also diagnosed with similar congenital heart defects. However  his 2-year-old daughter has no known cardiac abnormalities.   In conclusion  with multidisciplinary management and care  we hope to continue maintaining Mr. Salazar's quality of life and prevent the progression of his congenital heart disease to the best of our abilities.
13,1,33,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial33,Patient Presentation  Mr. Johnson is a 50-year-old Asian male who presents at the clinic today. He reports experiencing recent acute episodes of shortness of breath during normal daily activities and occasionally waking up at night due to difficulty in breathing.  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with a congenital heart disease known as Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) during infancy. He underwent corrective surgery around the age of 6 months and has been maintained on various cardiac medications since then. His mother had reportedly faced similar heart problems but his family history is not extensively documented.   Mr. Johnson is a non-smoker and he refrains from alcohol and illicit drugs. He is married  has two kids  and is a schoolteacher by profession. His reviews about lipid profile  glucose tolerance test  and tetanus toxoid are overdue.  In terms of his past medical history apart from the congenital heart disease  he was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia in his late 30s. Also  he has been managing his type 2 diabetes through diet and medication for the past seven years.  He has been fairly regular with his cardiac check-ups and annual health reviews with only occasional minor violations. His echocardiograms had been largely stable until two years ago when they revealed moderate right ventricular enlargement.  In addition to his baseline medications  he regularly takes aspirin  a beta-blocker  an ACE inhibitor  and a lipid-lowering drug. He is also prescribed metformin to manage his diabetes. Mr. Johnson is well informed about his disease  and has been cooperative and compliant with the treatments and medical advice he has received so far.  In summary  Mr. Johnson is a 50-year-old male with a medical history significant for ToF reparation in childhood  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes. His recent onset of dyspnea on exertion and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea might suggest worsening of his underlying cardiac condition. Diagnostic procedures  medication reviews  and adjustments need to be assessed in light of new symptoms.
13,1,34,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial34,"Presentation  Good afternoon  today we have a patient presenting congenital heart disease. The individual is an 3-month old female infant name Alexis Smith. Alexis is African-American  from Charleston  South Carolina. She was born full-term at 38 weeks via normal vaginal delivery at a local hospital. There was no prenatal or perinatal distress reported  and the delivery was uneventful according to the mother's medical records.  Pertinent family history includes a sibling who passed away during infancy due to an undiagnosed cardiac disorder. The mother is currently 28 years old and the father is 32 years old and both are in good health. The mother denies any illicit drug use or significant alcohol consumption during pregnancy. No maternal history of diabetes  hypertension  or autoimmune diseases.  Alexis was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot during a routine check-up. Her symptoms include a bluish skin color (cyanosis)  shortness of breath and easy fatigability even while feeding. Upon physical examination  a """"to and fro"""" murmur was heard  with a loud ejection click. The child has also been having difficulties in gaining weight due to failure to thrive  another symptom often present in infants with Tetralogy of Fallot.   She was vaccinated according to the CDC schedule  with her immunizations up-to-date.  No previous surgical history is reported for the infant patient. Alexis is currently on a prostaglandin E1 infusion to keep the ductus arteriosus open and improve blood flow until surgery.  The plan is to conduct further tests like an echocardiogram  cardiac catheterization and other necessary imaging test  and to start management on beta-blockers  diuretics  digoxin or possibly a corrective cardiac surgery also known as Intracardiac Repair Surgery once her health condition becomes stable."
13,1,35,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial35,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 6-month old Caucasian female with a known diagnosis of congenic heart disease  specifically a ventricular septal defect. The baby was born through normal delivery  full-term with a birth weight of 3.2 kg  after an uneventful pregnancy. The baby's diagnosis was made two days post-birth during the routine neonatal screening. However  the patient's parents noticed symptoms including difficulty in feeding  poor weight gain  and episodes of fast breathing and frequent respiratory infections. The baby does not have any allergies and has not undergone any surgical procedures.  She was admitted for cyanotic episodes suspected to be due to her congenital heart disease. she shows abnormal second heart sound and a holosystolic murmur over the left sternal border.   Family history is significant with the father diagnosed with a bicuspid aortic valve in his late teens and an older sibling with an atrial septal defect that was successfully corrected with minimal invasive technique.   Upon evaluation  an echocardiogram was performed  which confirmed the previous diagnosis of a moderate-sized ventricular septal defect with a left-to-right shunt. The baby is currently on diuretic therapy and is under the care of a pediatric cardiologist.   She has been scheduled for an open-heart surgical repair of VSD. The surgical team is optimistic in correlation of the operation pertaining to similar successful procedures on patients of the same age with the same diagnosis.  The aim is to ensure that the child can live a healthy life without being subjected to the restricting symptoms she currently experiences. Additional follow-up and potential therapies will be evaluated post-surgery based on her progress and recovery. Regular cardiac check-ups will be scheduled with a pediatric cardiologist to monitor her condition.
13,1,36,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial36,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 6-months-old  Sex: Male  Race: Hispanic  Residence: Ohio  United States  Presentation: John Doe  a 6-months-old male infant  presents with a medical history indicative of a potential congenital heart disease. Since birth  the baby has struggled with feeding and is not gaining weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Often  especially during feeding  he also demonstrates signs of fatigue.  In addition to these primary symptoms  John Doe's parents observed some breathlessness and increased restlessness while the infant is sleeping. They have also noticed that his skin often has a bluish hue  especially around his lips and under his nails  suggesting signs of cyanosis.  Past Medical History:  Prenatal history reports were largely uneventful  with no known in-utero exposures or gestational issues. He was delivered naturally at 40 weeks of gestation and had an uncomplicated neonatal course. However  a heart murmur was detected during one of his routine check-ups at 2 months.  Family Medical History: Family history reveals that the infant’s maternal grandfather has a history of heart disease. No instances of congenital heart disease are known in the family.  In summary  given these clinical signs  symptoms  and the potential familial link  a diagnosis of a congenital heart disease is being considered  and further relevant diagnostic investigation is warranted to confirm the same. Plans should include a Pediatric Cardiology consultation  Echocardiography  and possibly cardiac MRI for more detailed morphological and functional assessment.
13,1,37,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial37,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Congenital Heart Disease  Introduction: Today  I'll be presenting the case of our patient Mr. John Doe  born with a congenital heart disease.   Demographic Information: Mr. John Doe is a Caucasian male  currently aged 35  residing in Denver Colorado. He is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. His occupation is a software engineer  which is mostly a sedentary job involving very limited physical activity.  Clinical History: Mr. Doe was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a type of congenital heart disease immediately after his birth. His diagnosis was confirmed with an echocardiogram in his infancy which revealed four abnormalities associated with TOF: a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary artery)  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta.  Mr. Doe underwent intracardiac repair surgery at the age of 6 months as a corrective measure for TOF. Subsequently  he was prescribed cardiac medications and advised to facilitate regular health surveillance with a cardiologist.   Past Medical History: Apart from congenital heart disease  Mr. Doe's medical history is significant for mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  diagnosed at age 30  presumably due to secondary effects of his primary cardiac condition. He is currently on regular bronchodilator inhalers for the same.  Family History: Mr. Doe's family medical history is significant for heart disease. His father had ischemic heart disease and passed away at age 56 due to a myocardial infarction. Our patient's mother  aged 70  was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy at the age of 65.  Current Condition & Management: At present  Mr. Doe’s TOF is compensated  and his COPD is well managed with the inhalers. He is periodically monitored through echocardiograms  ECGs  and lung function tests. He also maintains a healthy lifestyle by engaging in low-intensity exercises and following a balanced diet. He is counseled about the importance of timely medication and regular follow-ups as recommended.  Conclusion: Overall  patient Mr. John Doe represents an illustrative case of congenital heart disease with successful early surgical intervention and vigilant chronic disease management. His current health status remains stable on the prescribed medication regimen and necessary lifestyle modifications.
13,1,38,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial38,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Congital Heart Disease   Patient Details: Name: Baby John Doe Age: 6 months old  Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Birth Weight: 3.5 Kg  Residence: Baltimore  Maryland  Presenting Complaint: Parents have observed episodes of fast breathing and poor feedings in this child. He experiences sweating during feeding and has been gaining weight at a slower pace since birth.   Medical History: John Doe is a six-month-old patient  presented with indications of congenital heart disease (CHD)  specifically suspected symptoms of Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD).   He was born at 37 weeks via C-section due to maternal preeclampsia with no immediate postnatal complications noted. Routine newborn screening tests were all negative. His development milestones have been slightly delayed.   Family History:  There is no family history of CHD or any other hereditary diseases. The mother is healthy without any known medical conditions. The father has hypertension which is well controlled with medication.  Previous Hospitalizations: John has had no previous hospitalizations or surgeries.   Medications:  John is not on any regular medications.   Allergies: No known drug allergies.  Immunization Status:  John is up-to-date on all recommended infant immunizations.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  a systolic murmur is noted. He appears mildly cyanotic  particularly when crying.  Initial Laboratory Investigations:  A chest radiograph and echocardiogram were ordered for further assessment. The chest X-ray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette  and echocardiogram has shown a large VSD.  Proposed Management Plan:  John is referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further assessment for the ventricular septal defect. Depending upon the conclusions of these evaluations  potential cardiac surgery may be required.   In conclusion  John Doe's presenting complaints  physical examination  and his echocardiogram findings are mostly indicative of a large ventricular septal defect  a type of congenital heart disease. Indications like slow growth  difficulty in feeding  sweating  along with the physical exam and echo findings  are all indicative of this diagnosis and this warrants a referral to a specialist.
13,1,39,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial39,Title: Congenital Heart Disease in a Pediatric Patient    Patient Profile: Name: [To Maintain Anonymity  Name is Withheld]  Age: 2 years Gender: Female Nationality: Hispanic   Chief Complaint: The patient presented with symptoms of shortness of breath  poor feeding  and a failure to thrive.   Medical History: The patient is a 2-year-old Hispanic female with a recent diagnosis of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). She was born full-term with no immediate postnatal complications or hospital admissions. However  at six months  regular wellness checkups highlighted slow weight gain and reduced growth trajectory when compared to the CDC’s pediatric growth chart. She also exhibited persistent respiratory infections.  Her mother reports frequent episodes of fatigue  even after minimal exertive activities such as feeding. The patient also sweats excessively  particularly during feeding. The patient's mother and father are healthy with no diagnosed heart disease. The family history is significant  however  showing that a maternal uncle had neonatal death due to undiagnosed congenital heart disease.  Diagnosis: Upon physical examination  the patient was found cyanotic with a heart murmur noticeable upon auscultation. A chest x-ray revealed cardiac enlargement. The subsequent Echocardiogram confirmed a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a form of CHD.   Current Medications: Ongoing medications include Furosemide (Diuretic) and Digoxin (to strengthen heart contractions) with a future plan to adjust medications depending on the patient's progress.  Summary: This case describes a female Hispanic toddler  presenting with cyanosis  poor feeding  and failure to thrive  diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot. Her symptoms are managed using pharmacological measures  but surgical intervention may be considered in future  depending on her progress and the severity of her symptoms. Her family history highlighting a potential genetic prevalence of CHD indicates the need for regular monitoring and checkups of siblings and other close familial relations.
13,1,40,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial40,Patient Presentation  Patient: John Aniston  a 2-month-old Caucasian male infant.  Residence: Knoxville  Tennessee  Demographics: The patient was born full term without any pregnancy complications. The mother did not report any tobacco  alcohol  or illicit drug use throughout the pregnancy. There was also no known exposure to teratogens.   Presenting Problem: The patient presents with poor feeding and progressive fatigue during feeds  excessive sweating  and frequent respiratory infections since he was born. Upon further assessment  the mother reports that he has not been gaining weight as expected for his age.  Past Medical History: The patient has been hospitalized two times for respiratory distress presumably secondary to viral infections.   Family History: There's a notable family history of congenital heart disease on the paternal side with the father having had corrective surgery for a ventricular septal defect in his early childhood.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  the pediatrician notes tachypnea and tachycardia. The patient has moderate hepatomegaly. Auscultation of the chest reveals a harsh holosystolic murmur.   Potential Diagnosis: The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest possible congenital heart disease. The family history supports ventricular septal defect as a differential diagnosis.   Future Steps: Echocardiography and a complete cardiovascular workup will be recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition  after which an appropriate treatment plan will be devised  possibly involving surgical intervention.  This is a typical representative case summary for a pediatric patient presenting with congenital heart disease  specifically a ventricular septal defect. Each individual patient's medical history and presentation may vary  thus necessitating a comprehensive medical evaluation and often a multi-disciplinary approach to management  involving a pediatric cardiologist and possibly a pediatric cardiac surgeon.
13,1,41,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial41,Patient Presentation:   Today  we discuss an 8-year-old Hispanic male patient presenting with congenital heart disease (CHD).   This patient was born at 36 weeks gestation and was identified as having CHD immediately after birth. He underwent a palliative surgery one week post-birth for a congenital cardiac anomaly characterized by Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). This consists of four heart defects including ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy and an overriding aorta.   Throughout his life  he has been regularly attending cardiology outpatient departments and has had fairly stable cardiac health status between his surgical follow-ups. Despite his condition  he has managed a relatively good quality of life and participates in school-based activities with some limitations.   In terms of family history  no other family members have been diagnosed with CHD or other significant heart diseases. However  his parents were identified as carriers of a single nucleotide polymorphism that might be a risk factor for TOF.   Completing a comprehensive review of the patient's systems  the findings included shortness of breath with exertion  a history of clubbing of fingers  occasional syncopal episodes  and a recent decrease in exercise tolerance. No changes were noted in his diet  sleep pattern  or neurocognitive functions. The patient and his parents report compliance with prescribed medication regimens including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors.   The patient remains susceptible to respiratory infections and has experienced several bouts of pneumonia. He received routine immunizations  including pneumococcal and flu vaccines  as per the pediatric immunization guidelines.  In conclusion  our patient displays a typical sequence of clinical findings and events characterized by TOF. The palliative surgery applied during infancy somewhat corrected the defects but did not eliminate the symptoms entirely. Long-term follow-up and the possibility of additional future surgeries remain essential considerations in the ongoing management of this young patient's CHD.
13,1,42,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial42,Patient Presentation  Introduction: The patient is a two-month-old female infant named Ava Thompson  of Caucasian ethnicity. Her family resides in rural Kansas where her father is a farmer and her mother is a part-time first-grade teacher. Ava is the youngest of three siblings  with two older brothers aged four and six.  Family Health History: The family has no history of congenital heart diseases  though the mother previously had three miscarriages which were thought to be due to chromosomal abnormality.  Past medical history: Ava was born full-term following a regular pregnancy and delivery via Normal Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery (NSVD). She had mild jaundice but responded well to phototherapy and was discharged three days post-birth. Her immunizations are up-to-date.  Presenting Condition: Ava was brought into the pediatric clinic due to her mother's concerns about her failure to gain weight and persistent breathing difficulties. She also observed Ava turning pale and sweating excessively  particularly during breastfeeds noted her to fatigue easily.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  Ava was underweight for her age  with poor skin turgor  indicating possible dehydration. She had a heart rate of 130 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 45 breaths per minute. Her pulse was weak  and she was somewhat cyanotic. She exhibited difficulty breathing  with frequent sighing and grunting  and retracting with each breath. Her chest had a parasternal heave and a palpable thrill.  These findings are suspicious for a Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)  possibly a ventricular septal defect or coarctation of the aorta. In view of this  Ava has been referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further evaluation and appropriate management.
13,1,43,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial43,Presentation of Patient:   Patient Information:   Name: Emily Smith  Age: 6 months old Sex: Female  Ethnicity: Caucasian Religion: Christian  Residential Address: Omaha  Nebraska   Presenting Complaint:   Miss Emily Smith  a 6-month-old Caucasian female  presents with symptoms of shortness of breath  poor feeding  frequent respiratory infections  and developmental delay. She exhibits signs of inadequate weight gain and displays insufficient energy for her age.   Past Medical History:  Emily was born at term via a normal vaginal delivery; however  lethargy and cyanosis were noticed within the first week of life. A murmur was detected during her Routine Neonatal Checkup  which led to further diagnostic examinations  including an echocardiogram that revealed a congenital heart defect. The precise nature of the heart defect is not clearly defined yet. It has been deemed significant and likely to be the cause of Emily's current symptoms.   She was hospitalized for pneumonia at 3 months of age  likely exacerbated by her undiagnosed congenital heart defect. There is no known family history of heart diseases or genetic disorders. All her immunizations are up to date.   In summary  Emily is a 6-month-old female with probable congenital heart disease  presenting with symptoms that include difficulty in feeding  weight gain issues  and frequent respiratory infections. She needs additional diagnostic evaluations to determine the precise nature and severity of her heart defect and formulate a suitable management plan that can decisively improve her current health condition and overall quality of life.
13,1,44,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial44,Patient Presentation:   We have before us a 2-month-old male child named Ethan Cole. He was born full-term with a documented birth weight within the normal range. His parents have no noteworthy genetic disorders or previous children with congenitive malfunctions. Ethan is their first child; mother is 32 and the father is 34  both are non-smokers and lead a healthy lifestyle.  Approximately 3 weeks post-birth  during a routine examination  Ethan's pediatrician noted an abnormal heart sound. Following that  an echocardiogram was performed that suggested a potential congenital heart disease.   His medical history since has been dominated by repeated episodes of rapid breathing  restlessness  and difficulty in feeding. He appears to have poor weight gain; his current weight is 4.2 kgs  which falls into the 10th percentile of the WHO child growth standards for his age.   He was admitted once at 6 weeks of age for a 1-day history of cold extremities and poor feeding. Ethan turned blue for a few seconds while crying before turning a normal color again  an episode suggestive of Cyanosis.   Heart auscultation during regular check-ups and admission showed a continuous 'machinery' heart murmur  especially along the left upper sternal border  pointing towards possible Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA).   Ethan's developmental milestones for his age seem on track  with the only notable difference being in the gross motor aspect potentially secondary to his heart condition.  In conclusion  based on the clinical presentation and echocardiogram finding Ethan appears to be suffering from a form of congenital heart disease. We will proceed with necessary medical intervention and monitor his condition closely. Let's aim to give him a chance for a healthier childhood  focusing not just on his physical health but overall wellbeing.
13,1,45,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial45,Presentation Title: Case Study: Congital Heart Disease in a Pediatric Patient  Slide 1: Patient Overview: Today  we will be discussing the case of our patient  John Doe  a 3-month old male infant  born and resides in San Francisco  California. He is of Asian descent  specifically  his parents are both of Chinese origin. John was born full-term at UCSF Birth Center with a weight of 3.6kg and a length of 51cm. He was brought to us due to concerns of poor feeding and cyanosis.  Slide 2: Past Medical History: John's prenatal screenings were all normal  with his mother attending regular prenatal visits and maintaining good maternal health. The pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. However  he has had bouts of decreased activity and difficulty feeding since birth.  Slide 3: Family's Medical History: On a review of the family history  it is noted that there are no recorded heart problems or congenital diseases in his parents or three older siblings. However  congenital heart disease is present in a cousin on his mother's side.  Slide 4: Symptoms: John exhibits signs of persistent cyanosis  particularly beyond the first couple of days after birth. He has difficulty with feeding and seems much less active than babies of a similar age. He gains weight at a slower pace  and each feed lasts longer than the average duration.  Slide 5: Diagnosis: Upon these symptoms being noted  clinical investigations were conducted. An echocardiogram confirmed the presence of Tetralogy of Fallot - a congenital heart disease - as the probable cause of his symptoms.  Slide 6: Course of Action: Treatment has since been initiated to correct the congenital defect using a combination of medication and planning for surgery at a later stage of infancy.   Slide 7: Future Steps: John's team of dedicated pediatric cardiologists  cardiac surgeons  nurses  and nutritionists continue to monitor his development closely and make necessary adjustments to his treatment plan. Encouragingly  given the early diagnosis and intervention  the prognosis for children such as John who have congenital heart disease is improving continually. With suitable medical and surgical management  many can expect to live into adulthood and lead fulfilling lives.   ---- Reference:  Marelli  A.J.  Ionescu-Ittu  R.  Mackie  A.S.  Guo  L.

13,1,46,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial46,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 3 year-old male of Hispanic ethnicity who presented to the pediatric outpatient department of our hospital with congenital heart disease. His home is in the local vicinity with his biological parents and a younger sibling. The family's socioeconomic status is considered average and their lifestyle is essentially sedentary. The parents do not report any history of drug abuse or exposure to harmful environmental factors.   The toddler was born via caesarean section at full term with no immediate post-natal complications. He was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart defect  during the routine neonatal examinations. Vital signs at presentation are stable with a moderate degree of cyanosis and fainting spells  hence  indicating a need for ongoing close observation.  The patient's past medical history is significant for two episodes of pneumonia at age 1 and 2 with successful treatment and recovery. He is up-to-date with his vaccinations as per the pediatric immunization schedule. There is no history of allergies or any known drug sensitivities.   Hereditary factors have also been considered  however  there is no reported family history of congenital heart diseases. The patient's development trajectory aligns with his age group  but with notable signs of fatigue and intolerance to physical activity  likely due to decreased arterial oxygen saturation.  In terms of pharmacotherapy  the patient is currently on Captopril  Furosemide  and Aspirin to manage symptoms and clinical manifestations. Surgical correction remains a potential future treatment pathway.  The patient's nutritional status is compromised with a slightly below average weight for his age  probably due to poor oxygen and nutrient supply to the body tissues caused by the heart defect. However  the patient's cognitive development is unaffected as per the milestones for his age. He is also reported to have moderate sleeping patterns with occasional disturbances due to breathlessness.  In summary  the young patient's congenital heart disease necessitates continuous medical management and close monitoring for trauma or falls due to fainting spells. The long-term health plan focuses on improving the patient's quality of life by managing symptoms and planning timely surgical interventions.
13,1,47,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial47,Presentation of Case:  Ms. Vanessa Johnson is a 28-year-old African-American female who presented with fatigue  dyspnea on exertion  and palpitations for the past several months. The patient reported that these symptoms have been escalating in frequency and intensity for the past year. Ms. Johnson was born in New York City and works as a paralegal in a legal firm downtown. She lives with her husband and does not have any children. She is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol socially. She does not use any illicit drugs.  On further examination  it was revealed that Ms. Johnson was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot at birth  a congenital heart defect. She underwent a total repair surgery when she was 2 years old  which included closure of the ventricular septal defect and relief of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Her childhood and adolescence were unremarkable without any significant health concerns except for yearly follow-ups for her congenital heart disease.  Her past medical history is significant for occasional migraines and an incident of pneumonia approximately 5 years ago which was treated successfully. She does not have any known allergies.  Family history reveals that her mother is living and has a history of hypertension. Her father passed away from a myocardial infarction at an early age. No other family members have congenital heart disease to her knowledge.  This brief presentation will be followed by an extensive physical examination  lab work and potential imaging studies to investigate the underlying cause of her current symptoms. 
13,1,48,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial48,Title: Congenital Heart Disease in a Pediatric Patient  Demographic Information: Patient: [Name withheld for privacy] Gender: Female Age: Three years Ethnicity: Asian Residence: Urban  Past Medical History: Our patient is a three-year-old Asian female from an urban setting. She has presented with congenital heart disease  confirmed by an echocardiogram completed when she was six months old. According to the report from the pediatric cardiologist  she has been diagnosed with Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD).   The patient has a status of Failure to Thrive (FTT) due to the congenital defect. Her growth trajectories have consistently fallen below the 5th percentile  a concern for her age and gender. There have been instances of recurrent Respiratory Tract Infections (RTIs)  including bronchitis and pneumonia  which we can comfortably link to her underlying heart condition.  She has had three hospital admissions since her diagnosis due to congestive heart failure leading to fluid retention and difficulties in breathing. During her last hospital admission  when she was two years old  she needed inotropic support and diuretics for effective management. Unfortunately  she has shown minimal to no improvement with the medical management provided  leading to a decreased quality of life.  There is no history of surgery  allergies  or other chronic illnesses. Her immunizations are up-to-date as per her age  with additional prophylaxis against influenza given annually.  Family History: Both parents are non-consanguineous and have no known history of any heart diseases. They are both leading a healthy lifestyle without any addictions. The patient has one older sibling who is healthy.  Current Medical Management: She is currently on Furosemide  Spironolactone  and Captopril for the management of her heart condition and failure.   Summary: The concerted goal now is to improve our young patient’s quality of life. We are considering surgical intervention for better management of her congenital heart disease. A Cardiology and Surgical team has been consulted for further evaluation and management.   The family has been counseled regarding the condition  its prognosis and the possible necessity of surgery in the future and they demonstrate a good understanding of her condition.   Finally  our Nursing  Dietary  Psychology and Social Work departments are providing supportive measures to improve her growth  nutrition  cognitive development  and overall well-being to ensure a comprehensive  multidisciplinary approach to her case.

13,1,50,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial50,Presenting Patient:   The presenting patient is a 5-month-old male infant named Alex  of Caucasian descent. He resides in Springfield  Missouri. The baby was delivered at full term via normal spontaneous delivery and the postnatal period was uneventful.  Presenting Symptoms:   The primary caregivers  his parents  report symptoms of poor feeding  frequent respiratory infections  failure to gain weight  profuse sweating  especially while eating  and a noticeable bluish tint to the skin  lips  and fingernails.  Past Medical History:  There is no significant acute or chronic illness reported in the past. However  he was diagnosed with a murmur at his 2-month check-up. Deeper investigations into the nature and cause of this murmur revealed a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot – a form of Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease.  Family and Genetic History:  There are no reported cases of congenital heart disease within his immediate or extended family. Nonetheless  Alex’s genetic testing showed a microdeletion in the 22q11.2 chromosome  which is known to be linked to the occurrence of Congenital Heart Disease.  Summary:  In conclusion  the patient’s presenting symptoms of poor feeding  failure to gain weight  frequent respiratory infections  and cyanosis  along with his murmur and genetic testing results  confirm the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot. The family has been counselled and the baby has been referred to paediatric cardiology for the commencement of appropriate therapy. The genetic findings will help facilitate the genetic counselling process to understand the recurrence risk in future siblings.
13,1,51,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial51,Title: Case Presentation - Congenital Heart Disease   Demographics:   Our patient is a six-month-old female infant named Jane Doe  born through spontaneous vaginal delivery. She comes from an Afro-American family who reside in a suburban neighborhood in Detroit  Michigan. The baby is brought in by her mother  a 29-year-old nurse with concerns related to the baby's feeding and growth.   Past Medical History:  Jane was born at term with no complications reported during pregnancy. She weighed 3.5 kg at birth. Antenatal scans were reported as normal  with no familial history of heart conditions or genetic abnormalities.  Presenting Issue:  Over the past two months  the mother has reported that Jane displays symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue during feeding  often sweating excessively. She is also concerned about her lack of weight gain and slower developmental milestones. Her growth chart shows she is falling below the 5th percentile in weight and height for her age. No fever  vomiting  or diarrhoea has been reported.  Initial Assessment:  On clinical examination  Jane is alert but appears pale and underweight. Vital signs show a heart rate of 145 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Cardiac examination reveals a soft systolic murmur heard over the left sternal border.  Conclusion:  Based on the clinical findings  the patient's condition is suggestive of a heart defect. Further investigations including an echocardiogram  EKG and chest X-ray will be needed for a definitive diagnosis of the type of congenital heart disease. Meanwhile  she has been started on high-calorie feedings to tackle her poor weight gain.
13,1,52,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial52,Title: Case Presentation on Congital Heart Disease  Patient Profile: The patient is a 6-month-old Caucasian male baby hailing from New York  USA. The baby is accompanied by his first-time parents who have no other children and no identified risk factors  such as congenital abnormalities or advanced maternal age. No significant family history of heart diseases or genetic disorders has been mentioned.   Past Medical History: The patient was born at 37 weeks of gestation via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery in a tertiary hospital. The mother's pregnancy was notable for routine antenatal care with no documented complications such as infections  diabetes  hypertension or drug exposure. There were also no issues during delivery and the neo-natal period like acute birth injuries  breathing problems  or infections.   Presenting Features: At around four months of age  the parents started noticing episodes of rapid breathing and poor feeding. As the weeks passed  the baby also began experiencing recurrent chest infections and demonstrated unsatisfactory weight gain. The patient was brought to the pediatrician who heard an abnormal heart sound during the routine check-up  and thus  referred the baby to a pediatric cardiologist for further examination. The pediatric cardiologist detected a heart murmur and ordered additional tests including echocardiography.   Findings and Diagnosis: The echocardiographic findings indicated that the baby was suffering from a congenital heart disorder known as Tetralogy of Fallot  characterized by four heart defects including a ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta. The disorder was causing insufficient oxygenated blood to reach the body leading to cyanosis (bluish discoloration of skin).  Current Treatment: The patient has been slated for corrective surgery  to take place at one year of age. Until then  the doctors have prescribed certain medications to help manage the symptoms  and regular follow-up visits have been scheduled for monitoring the condition of the patient.  The parents have been counseled about the condition  surgery and post-operative care. The situation has been taken into account  and the associated risks and benefits of the proposed management plan have been thoroughly discussed with them. Parental thoughts  feelings  and individual beliefs were also considered while deciding on the intervention strategy.  The mentioned case emphasizes the significance of routine check-ups in the early detection and timely management of congenital heart diseases in infants  highlighting the critical role of primary healthcare providers in influencing the prognosis of such conditions.
13,1,53,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial53,Patient Presentation  Demographic Information:  Patient Name: John Doe Age: 2 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic Birthplace: USA  Past Medical History:  Patient John Doe  a 2-year-old Hispanic boy  presented with shortness of breath  cyanotic episodes  chronic cough  and recurrent chest infections since birth. As an infant  the patient had episodes of poor feeding  and growth retardation was observed. The patient has shown signs of developmental delay compared to infants of similar age. On further probing  his mother reported warmer extremities (often sweaty) as compared to his torso during these episodes  along with apparent panic or anxiety.   John's prenatal history was uneventful  with normal antenatal scans. He was born at term and had a normal birth weight. However  the patient was diagnosed with a suspected congenital heart disease (CHD) soon after birth during a routine cardiac examination  which revealed a heart murmur. This led to focused diagnostic evaluations.   The patient’s congenital heart disease has been confirmed by various assessments including echocardiography  cardiac MRI and cardiac catheterization. Additionally  genetic testing has confirmed the absence of any related genetic conditions.   John Doe is currently on medications including diuretics and ACE inhibitors to help manage his symptoms. He has yet to have any corrective surgery  but it is being considered as a future management strategy depending upon his growth and adaptive response to the current medication.   There is no significant familial history of congenital heart defects. The patient has no allergy history. Close monitoring and regular follow-ups have been part of his medical journey.   Through his life course  extensive multidisciplinary team management  consisting of pediatricians  pediatric cardiologists  nutritionists  and physical therapists  and occasional admission to the hospital for the management of infections have been required. Psychological support for the family has also been a crucial part of his care.   In conclusion  patient John Doe is a young child presenting with the challenges associated with congenital heart disease. His medical journey necessitates a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to ensure he receives the best care possible for his growth and development.
13,1,54,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial54,Patient Presentation  Title: A Case of Congenital Heart Disease in a Three-Month-Old Male Infant  Introduction:  Today  I would like to present a case of a three-month-old male infant who was recently diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CHD).  Patient Demographics:  The patient  John Doe  is a three-month-old male of Caucasian descent. He was born full-term via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. He is currently living with his parents in New York City  and is the first child in the family.   Past Medical History:  John presented with noticeable cyanosis at birth which was initially attributed to transient tachypnea of the newborn. However  the cyanosis persisted despite initial treatments hence further evaluations were carried out.  John's prenatal ultrasounds were reportedly normal  and there was no significant family history of congenital heart disease or other genetic disorders. However  he was born with a low birth weight and struggled with feeding issues in his first few weeks of life. These challenges resulted in slower than expected weight gain. There was no history of premature birth  maternal drug use  or significant illnesses during pregnancy.  In his short life span  John has been admitted twice for pneumonia  and has had multiple visits to the hospital for respiratory difficulties  poor feeding  and failure to thrive.   A heart murmur was picked up during a routine physical examination at two months old  prompting further investigation into his cardiovascular health. Upon further examination  the murmur was located at the left sternal border  best heard at the pulmonary area  and graded 3/6. The patient also presented with hepatomegaly.  A chest radiograph showed a boot-shaped heart indicative of Tetralogy of Fallot  with decreased pulmonary blood flow suggesting right to left shunting. A follow-up echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis revealing pulmonary stenosis  ventricular septal defect  right ventricular hypertrophy  and overriding aorta.   In conclusion  we are managing a case of a three-month-old infant diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a form of congenital heart disease. The upcoming steps for John's management include close monitoring  providing supportive care  medicinal therapy for effusion control  and planning for corrective surgery.   Thank you for listening to this patient presentation.
13,1,55,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial55,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 27-year-old Caucasian male who has been diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CHD)  specifically Ventricular Septal Defect. Occupationally  he works as an office clerk and leads a sedentary lifestyle.   He was diagnosed with CHD at birth; however  he did not receive surgical intervention due to the small size of the defect and anticipated natural closure  which did not occur. Our patient is generally asymptomatic but occasionally complains of mild dyspnea and palpitations  particularly during physical exertion.   Past medical history includes recurrent respiratory infections during childhood  which may have been related to his underlying heart disease. He also reports mild episodes of fatigue and weakness but has no prior hospitalizations or major illnesses.   Mr. J is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally  in moderate amounts. He is not currently on any medications but is encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle to help control his symptoms. He has been attending regular cardiology follow-ups and his vitals have been stable.  Family history shows that his mother was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in her early twenties  and his eldest brother was diagnosed with CHD; specifically  patent ductus arteriosus but underwent successful surgical intervention during early infancy. It seems that our patient's CHD likely has a genetic component.  Moving forward  Mr. J will continue surveillance with cardiology and will also have preventative measures implemented including influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations due to his increased risk for respiratory infections. His case emphasizes the wide spectrum of CHD presentations and the necessity for prompt diagnosis  follow-up care and optimal management strategy to improve his quality of life and prevent the development of further complications. 
13,1,56,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial56,Patient Presentation:  Patient Name: Jane Doe Age: two weeks old Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Religion: Not applicable  Clinical Presentation: Jane Doe was brought to our pediatric clinic by her parents with concerns of persistent rapid breathing and poor feeding since birth.   Past Medical History: She was born at 38 weeks of gestation via cesarean section  with an uneventful antenatal period. Her birth weight was 3.5 kg. There is no history of any maternal health issues during pregnancy  including no reported infections  no illness  and no drug consumption. The mother's prenatal lab tests including TORCH (Toxoplasmosis  Other (syphilis  varicella-zoster  parvovirus B19)  Rubella  Cytomegalovirus  and Herpes infections) screen were all negative.   Family History: Ms. Doe is the first child  and there's no history of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)  bleeding disorders or any inherited diseases in the family. No history of congenital heart disease or any significant medical condition.  Present Complaint: Her parents report persistently rapid breathing  fatigue  and difficulty feeding since birth. Upon physical examination  she displayed signs of poor weight gain  difficulty feeding  rapid breathing  persistent fatigue  and cyanosis - bluish color of the skin and fingernails. Heart examination revealed a murmur.   Impression: Based on the presenting history and clinical examination  our patient  a two-week-old female infant  is suspected of having a congenital heart disease. Further diagnostic testing including chest X-ray  Echocardiogram  and Cardiac Catheterization are required to confirm this diagnosis and to provide more information about the structure and function of the heart.  This is a critical condition that requires prompt recognition  diagnosis  and management to avoid any life-threatening complications and to improve outcomes. Providing comprehensive care  the patient's current circumstance calls for a multidisciplinary approach involving cardiology  neonatology  nursing  dietetics  and social work teams.
13,1,57,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial57,Patient Presentation  The patient is a six-month-old female infant who has presented with signs consistent with congenic heart defect. She was born full term with no notable complications during the mother’s pregnancy or childbirth.   The child's parents brought her to the hospital following observations of unusual behaviors including rapid breathing  excessive sweating  and a generally fatigued demeanor. The young patient also presents some difficulties during feedings  often becoming short of breath. Despite being exclusively breastfed since birth  she appears underweight compared to the usual weight benchmarks for her age group.  She has had 3 hospital admissions since birth due to frequent episodes of pneumonia  which are possibly a complication of the underlying heart problem. The parents also report a bluish skin discoloration during crying or feeding. No history of genetic disorders or congenital defects is reported in the family. No other siblings.  Physical examination reveals a heart murmur. On cardiac auscultation  a continuous machine-like heart sound was heard. She also shows signs s of congestive heart failure such as tachycardia  tachypnea  and hepatomegaly.  The baby has been growing and meeting most developmental milestones appropriately despite her condition. No known drug allergies have been reported.  The case has been referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further evaluation  diagnosis confirmation and therapeutic approach  with supplemental oxygen being provided to alleviate cyanosis. Diagnostic tests  including echocardiogram  ECG  chest X-ray  and pulse oximetry  have been scheduled.   It is essential at this time to discuss thoroughly with the parents the patient's condition and what future medical care may entail. They must understand that congenital heart disease is not curable  but with proper care and management  the child can definitely live with it. They also need to recognize the signs of heart failure early to prevent severe complications. The importance of regular follow-up examinations should not be understated.   In summary  this pediatric patient has presented with a likely congenital heart condition  its severity and type yet to be determined by specialized investigations. It's essential to keep the lines of communication open with the family and ensure that a comprehensive treatment plan is in place.

13,1,59,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial59,Ladies and Gentlemen   I would like to discuss the case of a 2-year-old girl  Sofia Rodriguez  born and residing in San Francisco  California. She was born a full-term 39-week infant through a normal vaginal delivery significant only for fetal distress. Sofia is the second child of her parents  who have no prior family history of congenital anomalies  hereditary diseases  or early onset cardiac conditions.   The patient was referred for a pediatric cardiology assessment due to a murmur noted during her recent regular health check-up. Sofia's mother reported noticing recent symptoms of easy fatigue and shortness of breath in Sofia; however  Sofia's growth  development  and nutritional intake are reportedly normal for her age.  Her past medical history is notable for frequent episodes of bronchitis since age 1  which her pediatrician had attributed to weak immunity. She has had no surgical history and no known allergies. She is up to date with all her immunizations as per the normal vaccination schedule for her age.   Upon physical examination  Sofia was alert and active. Vital signs were slightly off the pediatric normative scale  with tachycardia and mild tachypnea noted. Cardiac examination revealed a loud pansystolic murmur  best heard at the lower left sternal border. There was no evidence of congestive heart failure  but mild cyanosis was noted in her lips and fingers.  Laboratory tests are ordered and pending. An echocardiogram has also been scheduled to further delineate the anatomy and function of Sofia's heart structures. At the moment  our differential diagnoses include various forms of congenital heart disease  such as ventricular septal defect  atrial septal defect  or patent ductus arteriosus  among others.  In conclusion  Sofia is a high-risk pediatric patient currently displaying signs consistent with congenital heart disease. Prompt diagnosis  careful monitoring  and timely intervention are crucial at this stage. We are adopting a thorough and patient-centered approach to manage her condition. More clinical and diagnostic information will be needed before we can proceed with confirming the final diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan for Sofia.  Thank you.
13,1,60,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial60,"Patient Presentation:  A 4-month-old Hispanic male infant  named Christian Perez  presents to our pediatric clinic today accompanied by his parents. Born at term without any immediate postnatal complications  Christian is the second child of the family. His parents express concerns about his slow weight gain  grunting noises during feeding  and noticeable blue color around his lips.  Christian was born to a 27-year-old healthy mother  with an unremarkable prenatal history and no exposure to alcohol  drugs  or tobacco. The pregnancy was her second  with a 4-year-old healthy girl being the first. This was a planned pregnancy  and gestation occurred without any complications. No cases of congenital heart diseases are reported in the family.  Physical examination of Christian reveals cyanosis  especially around the mouth and during feeding. The infant presents with mild tachypnea and tachycardia.  The preliminary findings suggest that Christian might have a cyanotic congenital heart disease  possibly Tetralogy of Fallot  given the characteristic signs of """"blue baby"""" syndrome  poor feeding  and slow growth. However  further diagnostic tests  such as echocardiography  EKG  and possibly cardiac catheterization  need to be performed to confirm the diagnosis.  His vaccinations are up-to-date  and he has no known drug allergies. He had been treated for a minor respiratory infection last month. Otherwise  his medical history is free from any major illness or hospital admissions.  Despite his condition  Christian has met many of his age-appropriate milestones. He tracks movement with his eyes and has begun to coo in response to his parents' voices.  We will proceed with the necessary tests and specialists referrals to confirm the diagnosis and begin appropriate care for Christian promptly. His Parents were counseled about the implications and potential challenges of the condition  as well as the importance of diligent health and growth monitoring for Christian. They were assured of our team's commitment to provide the best possible care for their child."
13,1,61,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial61,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 2-year-old cacasian male named Jacob Smith  presented by his parents. He hails from Oregon  lives with his parents and one older sibling. His reason for visit is a scheduled follow-up in relation to congenital heart disease (CHD).  Jacob was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot upon his birth  a type of CHD which is identified by a combination of four heart defects: ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta.   Medical History:  Jacob's condition was first suspected during an antenatal scan  and confirmed after birth with an echocardiogram. At one month of age  Jacob underwent a complete repair surgery of his heart. Post operatively  he experienced some mild desaturations  but these did not require additional surgical intervention and resolved spontaneously.   His parents have reported adequate weight gain and growth for Jacob after his surgery  and he has hit all his developmental milestones within the normal range for his age. Jacob has been vaccinated as per the regular schedule. He has otherwise had normal health for the first two years of his life  with the usual minor infections managed at home. He is not on any regular medications currently  except for occasional prophylactic antibiotics when necessary.  Family History:  There is no known family history of congenital heart disease or other inherited diseases. Jacob’s parents and older sibling are all reportedly in good health. Due to the sporadic nature of Jacob's condition  it is unlikely to have been inherited from his parents or to pose a risk to his sibling.   In summary  though Jacob continues to live with the effects of CHD  his recovery after cardiac surgery has been largely successful. We will continue with regular follow-up appointments to monitor his progress and ensure any potential complications are addressed promptly. Clinical vigilance is required to ensure Jacob’s continued good health in the light of his congenital condition.

13,1,63,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial63,Patient Presentation:  The patient is an 18-month-old female named Lisa Smith  recently migrated from Guatemala  currently residing with her adoptive parents in Seattle  Washington. She was adopted at 12 months old  and the biological family history is unknown. Lisa was brought in by her adoptive parents  who have noticed an increased frequency of breathlessness and episodes of poor feeding.   The patient’s past medical history is minimal due to her young age. No previous major illnesses  hospitalizations  or surgeries. Her immunizations are up to date as per her age and she was reported to have normal growth and development until the recent issues commenced.   At around 13 months of age  parents reported noticing unusual symptoms such as rapid breathing  poor weight gain  and episodes of cyanosis – a bluish discoloration of the skin  particularly during feeding. She has been increasingly lethargic and less active compared to her age peers.   Upon physical examination  the pediatrician detected a heart murmur that prompted suspicion of congenital heart disease (CHD). Lisa was referred for further evaluation including Echocardiography and chest X-ray.   In summary  considering the symptomatic presentation of breathing difficulty  poor feeding and growth  along with the identified heart murmur  the working diagnosis is a form of congenital heart disease. The exact type of CHD yet to be confirmed pending diagnostic imaging results. Early intervention and treatment will be crucial to improve Lisa’s prognosis and quality of life.
13,1,64,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial64,Patient Presentation:   We have a 6-month-old male patient  of Caucasian ethnicity born and living in San Diego  California. He came in with his parents  who have been noticing that their child gets more tired and breathless compared to other infants at his age. The patient also had symptoms which include profuse sweating  especially during feeds  and slower weight gain.   Family History:  There is no significant history of any congenital diseases in his family. His parents are non-consanguineous with no known hereditary genetic abnormalities. The mother had an uneventful pregnancy and this is their first child.  Medical History:   This patient was born full-term by normal vaginal delivery. His birth weight was 3.2 kgs  and his neonatal period was uneventful  with no history of NICU admission. However  at around 2 months of age  his parents started noticing that their child would get tired easily and sweat profusely even with mild activities like feeding  which they initially attributed to normal baby behavior.   Physical Examination:  On vital examination  his heart rate was 160 beats per minute  a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute  SpO2 at 92% in room air  and a below-average weight for his age. There are no visible deformities noted. He showed signs of distress with grunting. Cardiac examination revealed a loud  harsh pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.   Given the child’s symptoms and physical examination findings  further investigations were carried out. The echocardiogram confirmed a diagnosis of Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)  a form of congenital heart disease.    The patient is now on a follow-up regimen and is currently being managed medically with diuretics. The option of elective surgical repair is kept open if the defect doesn't close spontaneously or if the patient continues to remain symptomatic.   Conclusion:   This case highlights the significance of early detection and management of congenital heart diseases such as VSD  which continues to be a leading cause of heart disease in infants. Regular follow-ups  combined with a robust management plan  are necessary to ensure optimal health outcomes for patients suffering from congenital heart diseases. 
13,1,65,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial65,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 5-year-old Caucasian boy named Tommy  currently residing in Houston  Texas with his parents. He has been exhibiting symptoms related to the heart  such as shortness of breath  fatigue  and blue-tinted skin  indicating a low oxygen level in the blood. These symptoms are especially pronounced during physical activities. There has also been an observed decrease in appetite and a slowed growth when compared to children of his age group.  One aspect of medical history that stands out pertains to the patient being diagnosed with a murmur shortly after birth. Inferentially  this may have indicated a possible congenital heart defect  which is suspected to be the underlying cause of his current symptoms. The mother reported that Tommy’s growth and developmental milestones appeared normal in the first few years of life  although the recurring symptoms have intensified over time.    The family history reveals a pattern of congenital heart disease on the father's side  including the paternal grandfather and a 7-year-old uncle. The mother's side does not appear to have any noticeable incidence of heart diseases. Tommy’s mother took prenatal vitamins and reported no alcohol  tobacco  or illicit drug use during pregnancy.   The patient also had pneumonia at the age of 2 and was treated successfully. There is no known allergy history. Current medications include multivitamin supplements for kids.   This case presents a high suspicion of a congenital heart disease that warrants thorough investigation. The family history and the patient’s symptoms point towards a possible heart anomaly. Genetic counseling should be considered given the pattern of hereditary congenital heart defects in the family.   Immediate attention should be directed to the assessment and management of Tommy's symptoms to optimize his comfort and health outcomes. The next step would involve cardiologic evaluation to ascertain the specific congenital heart defect and plan a management or intervention strategy accordingly. 
13,1,66,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial66,Title: Patient Presentation: Congenital Heart Disease  Patient Information:  Name: Emma Thompson Gender: Female Age: 8 months old Ethnicity: African American Birthplace: Los Angeles  United States Language: English   Presenting Complaint:  Emma was presented to our medical care by her parents who have been worried about her recurrent incidences of respiratory distress manifested by episodes of rapid breathing and poor feeding. They also expressed concerns about her unexplained inadequacy in weight gain  even though she has a well-balanced diet.  Past Medical History:  Emma was born full term via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. Her birthweight was 6.8 pounds. She spent the first week of life in the neonatal intensive care unit due to moderate respiratory distress at birth. Besides that  no associated illnesses were observed initially.  Family History:  Both her parents are generally healthy with no history of congenital anomalies  cardiovascular diseases  or other chronic illnesses. However  Emma’s maternal grandmother had a heart defect at birth  which was surgically corrected in her infancy.  Physical Examination:  On physical examination  Emma appeared smaller than normal for her age. Vital signs showed an elevated heart rate and respiration rate. On auscultation  there was an audible heart murmur. Rest of the examination was normal.  Based on these findings  clinical suspicion of a congenital heart disease is considered. An echocardiogram was ordered  which confirmed a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart defect.   Plan :  The primary management approach is surgical correction. Consultation with pediatric cardiologist and a cardiovascular surgeon will be done for further evaluation and management. Pre operative care and parental counselling will be initiated.   Long-term  Emma will require regular follow-up care with a cardiologist who specializes in congenital heart diseases to monitor her heart function.

13,1,73,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial73,"Patient Presentation  Patient Description: The patient is a 12-month old male infant identified as Jonathan. He is of Caucasian descent and comes from a middle-income family living in a suburban area.  Presenting Problem: Jonathan has been diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  which is a type of congenital heart disease. This was first suspected shortly after his birth due to a distinctive cyanotic episode  consistent with a """"Tet spell"""". Further diagnostic tests  including echocardiography  confirmed the diagnosis.   Past Medical History: Jonathan was born at term with a weight of 3.6 kg and no prenatal complications. Early postnatal period was initially unremarkable until he started presenting with episodes of cyanosis and difficulty in breathing  especially during periods of feeding or crying.   Family History: No significant family history of heart diseases or other congenital abnormalities. Both parents are healthy. The patient has one older sibling who is healthy as well. No history of sudden death or genetic diseases in the family.  Review of Systems: Jonathan's growth and development seem to be slightly delayed  especially in physical activities involving vigorous efforts. He presents with occasional tet spells characterized by sudden development of deep cyanosis followed by unconsciousness  alongside difficulty feeding  failure to gain weight  and dyspnea on exertion.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  the child appears to be smaller than expected for his age. A physical exam revealed a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border. There was also a noticeable cyanosis on his lips and nail beds  which seems to worsen with crying.  Summary: Jonathan is a 12-month-old boy with Tetralogy of Fallot  presenting with classic symptoms of the condition such as """"Tet spells""""  cyanosis  difficulty feeding  and failure to gain weight. He requires continuous monitoring and early surgical repair. "
13,1,74,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial74,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 4-year-old Caucasian male who was brought to our clinic by his parents due to their increased concern for his persistent shortness of breath  as well as noteworthy stunted growth in comparison to his identical twin brother. Apart from his main complaints  his parents also report a decrease in the toddler's play activities  performance  and overall stamina which becomes more noticeable during periods of moderate exertion.  Past Medical History:  Lucas  the patient  was born at term through a natural delivery to a primigravida mother. At birth  he was slightly smaller than his identical twin  but both were within normal weight ranges. His neonatal period was uneventful  with all standard newborn screenings  immunization  and check-ups carried out and showing normal results and progress. However  at six months old  growth disparities between Lucas and his twin began to emerge  and his weight percentile dropped significantly.  Demographic Information:  Lucas comes from a middle-class socioeconomic background. His parents are non-smokers. Family history reveals that there are no known congenital heart diseases on either side of the family. Lucas's mother did not have any illnesses  infections  or use any recreational or prescription medications during pregnancy.  Upon evaluation  physical examination revealed mild cyanosis and clubbed fingers—signs associated with chronic hypoxia. His chest palpation and auscultation findings were not normal and gave suspicion of a congenital heart defect  potentially Tetralogy of Fallot or a type of septal defect  which would account for his symptoms.  In conclusion  Lucas is a 4-year-old male presenting with symptoms suggestive of congenital heart disease. Further diagnostic procedures like Echocardiogram and EKG are suggested to confirm the diagnosis and determine the most appropriate management plan.
13,1,75,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial75,Slide 1: Introduction  Today  we will be discussing the case of a patient with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD).   Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a 2-month-old female infant named Emily. She was born prematurely at 34 weeks with a birth weight of 2.3 kg. She is of Caucasian ethnicity and was born to a 28-year-old mother who experienced a normal pregnancy apart from a urinary tract infection in the second trimester. Emily is the first child of the parents  with no history of congenital anomalies in the family.   Slide 3: Presenting Complaint  Emily's parents have brought her in with concerns about her lower than average weight gain  increased irritability  and a high respiratory rate. They reported that the baby has difficulty feeding  often sweating excessively during feeds.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  Emily was diagnosed with a heart murmur during her first pediatric assessment at birth. At that time  an echocardiogram was performed  and it was suggested that she might have a congenital heart defect.   Slide 5: Possible Diagnosis   Given the noted murmur  feeding difficulties  and other signs  it was suspected that Emily may have a form of Congenital Heart Disease. Further diagnostic tests  including a more detailed echocardiogram and a likely cardiac catheterization  are to be scheduled to come to a definitive diagnosis and to plan the course of treatment.  Slide 6: Conclusion   This case highlights the importance of early detection and diagnosis of congenital heart diseases. With advancements in pediatric cardiology  children like Emily can receive effective treatments which significantly improve their quality of life.
13,1,76,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial76,Title: Presentation of a Pediatric Patient with Tetralogy of Fallot  Introduction: I present a case of a 4-year-old female patient  identified as patient X  with known congenital heart disease (CHD)  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot.  Demographic Information: Patient X is a native of Houston  Texas and lives with her parents and two elder siblings. She has no history of smoking or alcohol consumption  granted her age. The ethnicity of the family is Caucasian. The family income level is average  and her parents are able to provide regular medical care.  Medical History: Patient X was diagnosed with the Tetralogy of Fallot at birth  a diagnosis which arose following perinatal cyanosis and dyspnea. Her CHD was confirmed by echocardiogram  inclusive of the four typical findings: right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (pulmonary stenosis)  ventricular septal defect  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta.  The parents of patient X disclosed a family history of congenital heart illness on her mother's side – her maternal uncle had undergone surgical repair for a ventricular septal defect. However  the parentage presents no reported history of metabolic or genetic disorders and no chronic exposure to environmental hazards during pregnancy.  Progress and Management: Over her lifespan of four years  patient X had multiple visits to the pediatrician  all related to her CHD. She received necessary treatments and medications as advised by her range of healthcare professionals. Although she hasn’t yet undergone structural heart repair due to clinical judgments upon her symptoms and overall condition  it has been planned and will be performed once she reaches the applicable size and age  most likely in the coming year.  Managed with beta-blockers and diuretics  her hypoxemia and cyanotic spells are generally controlled. The patient has not been hospitalized since discharge following birth  outside of routine visits and follow-ups.  Conclusion: Despite her challenging start  Patient X has been managed well with current treatments. Anticipated structural heart repair surgery on the horizon aligns with the standard management for such cases. The collaboration of patient X's family and her medical team shows promise for a future with improved heart function and quality of life.

13,1,80,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial80,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Congital Heart Disease   Demographic Information: Patient Name: Emily Jones Gender: Female  Age: 5 Months Race: Caucasian  Residential Status: Ohio  USA Ethnicity: Non-Hispanic  Parents: Mr. and Mrs. John Jones  Past Medical History: Emily is a 5-month-old baby girl who  up until now  has been considerably healthy with a normal growth trajectory. She was born full-term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. Emily has no known drug allergies.  However  Emily's parents have noticed recently that she becomes excessively tired during feeding  and her skin appears to have a slight bluish tinge. Emily's parents also reported that she's gaining weight at a slower pace. The pediatrician also noticed fast breathing and poor weight gain as a result of the difficulty Emily was having with her feedings.   On further inquiry  it was revealed that there was a family history of congenital heart disease on Emily's father's side. Emily's aunt had Tetralogy of Fallot  but received surgical correction during her childhood and is now leading a healthy life. Both parents and the elder brother are healthy with no significant medical history.   Based on her clinical presentation  family history  physical examination  and subsequent diagnostic procedures  Emily has been diagnosed with congenital heart disease  specifically - a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Pertinent investigations including chest X-rays and echocardiography have confirmed the diagnosis.   Emily's current management plan has been to monitor her growth and symptoms. She has been referred to a Pediatric Cardiologist  who is currently assessing her need for potential surgical correction of her VSD.   Conclusion: In summary  Emily is a 5-month-old female with a diagnosis of ventricular septal defect - a common type of congenital heart disease. Associated with a family history of congenital heart disease  her clinical course will be closely followed by her healthcare team  including a Pediatric Cardiologist  to ensure timely intervention if necessary and to secure the best possible outcome for her future health.
13,1,81,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial81,"Patient Presentation:  We present a three-month-old Caucasian male infant who was referred to our cardiology team with a suspected congenital heart disease (CHD). This patient was born in our hospital through induction of labor at full term after an uneventful pregnancy. Birth weight was 2.9 kg within normal limits  and he has had normal growth and development to date. He is exclusively breastfed. The child has no known allergies. Immunizations are up-to-date for age.   Past medical history is significant for episodes of mild cyanosis  and shortness of breath observed by the parents  especially during feeding since birth. No history of hospitalization  surgery  serious illness or major trauma. There were no signs of early neonatal jaundice  and newborn screening tests came back negative.   In terms of family history  there is no known history of congenital heart disease  genetic abnormalities  or maternal drug use during pregnancy. However  mother's older sister had a child with Down Syndrome.   During his regular newborn check-ups  the pediatrician was concerned about a persistent heart murmur  fatigue  and poor weight gain. Due to these concerning symptoms  he was referred to our service for further specialist evaluation. The heart murmur along with the cyanosis and dyspnea during feeding were highly suggestive of a congenital heart disease  but the exact type of disease needed to be identified.   After conducting appropriate imaging and diagnostic tests  an echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) aka a """"hole in the heart"""". A small defect was found in the ventricular septum  leading to a left-to-right shunt. The patient was then scheduled for regular follow-ups with a pediatric cardiologist  and parents were counseled about the common complications.   Our main objective now is to monitor the patient closely for possible complications that might require surgical intervention while supporting his general growth and development  and to instruct his parents about signs of heart failure and when to seek immediate medical attention. As such  we hope to provide the child with a normal and healthy lifespan. "
13,1,82,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial82,Patient Presentation  Demographics: Patient Name: [Patient's Name] Age: 6 months Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Residential History: Born and residing in New York  USA. Family History: Non-consanguineous parents  No known familial genetic disorders.  Presenting condition: The patient was brought in by his parents who exhibited concerns over his recurrent bouts of rapid breathing  poor weight gain  and extreme fatigue even during feeding. The family has noticed occasional bluish discoloration of the patient’s skin  particularly of the lips and tongue.  Past Medical History: The patient was born at term via uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery with no adverse prenatal  perinatal  or postnatal incidents. However  pediatric follow-ups had identified a characteristic heart murmur leading to a preliminary diagnosis of congenital heart disease. The patient has no previous surgical history or known allergies. He has been fully vaccinated following the CDC schedule for his age.  Work up and investigations including an echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization confirm the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart disease. The absence of other genetic abnormalities and syndromes was confirmed via a full genetic screening.  The patient's developmental milestones have been on par with his age group  with slightly delayed physical development attributed to his lower energy levels and fatigue due to the underlying cardiac condition.   Overall  the patient's condition requires close monitoring  nutritional support  and is being recommended for corrective cardiac surgery. Further genetic counseling is being suggested to the parents to provide information about risk factors in potential future pregnancies.
13,1,83,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial83,Title: Presentation of a Pediatric Patient Presenting with Congital Heart Disease  Demographics: Patient Name: Jane Doe Age: 2-months-old Gender: Female Ethnicity: African American Residential address: 1111 Parklane Street  Sacramento  California 95829 Place of Birth: California  USA.  Family History: Mother: healthy  has no known genetic disorders Father: healthy  father has mild hypertension    Presenting Complaint: Recurrent episodes of Cyanosis and breathlessness  Clinical Background: Miss Jane is a two-month-old African American female child  who has been presented in our clinic by her mother  due to concerns over her recurrent episodes of cyanosis and breathlessness specially while feeding. Jane is the first child of this young couple who report no instance of congenital heart diseases in their close families. The pregnancy and delivery were uneventful and Jane was born at a gestational age of 38 weeks.  Past Medical History: Post-birth  Jane has shown progressive difficulty in feeding and inappropriate weight gain. At the age of two weeks  Jane was observed for cyanosis around the lips and the face  especially during feeding. This symptom coupled with the signs of inadequate weight gain  prompted her parents schedule an early well-child exam. She was assessed for failure to thrive at the pediatrician's office at a month of age and a heart murmur was detected during physical examination which led her to undergo further heart investigation.  Past Surgical History: None  Current Medications: None  Allergies: No known drug allergies  Immunization History: Immunizations are up-to-date  as per the recommended vaccination schedule for her age.   In view of her clinical manifestations and family history  a differential diagnosis of a possible congenital heart disease was considered. She was referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further assessment and management. This case requires detailed investigation considering possible congenital heart malformations that could explain the patient's symptoms and signs. Our efforts will be directed towards achieving diagnostic clarity and subsequent appropriate interventions in a timely manner to achieve optimal outcomes and restore quality of life for Jane.
13,1,84,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial84,Title: Pediatric Patient Presentation  Demographic Information:  The patient is a 3-month-old Caucasian male from a middle-class background. He lives with his parents and an elder brother who are both healthy. Vaccinations are up-to-date  and the patient has no known allergies. The pregnancy and delivery were normal with no complications. However  the patient is not gaining weight according to the infant growth chart and has been displaying symptoms of fatigue and sweating.  Medical History: On early examination  he was found to have a heart murmur during regular pediatric check-ups  which led to further examination. There is no history of premature birth or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. There is no significant past medical history evident as this is his first health issue.   Family History: The patient’s maternal grandfather was diagnosed with a heart disorder  raising the probability of a hereditary predisposition to heart ailments. Both parents are unrelated and healthy with no known congenital heart diseases.    Current Evaluation: On physical examination  he presented with a pale appearance  poor weight gain  poor feeding  easy fatigability  and heavy sweating. Heart auscultation indicated a soft systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border.   Preliminary Diagnosis: Given the symptoms of fatigue  heavy sweating  lack of weight gain  and the presence of a heart murmur  the initial diagnosis is a congenital heart disease  possibly a septal defect. However  further assessment via echocardiogram  chest X-Ray  and EKG is planned to confirm.  Conclusion: The pediatric patient  despite having no early-life complications  has symptoms indicative of congenital heart disease. A definitive prognosis and treatment plan will be made once the diagnosis is confirmed. It's critical to monitor his development to ensure early treatment effectiveness.   {Please note that the information provided herein is only a hypothetical presentation of a congenital heart disease patient.

13,1,85,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial85,Title: Congenital Heart Disease Presentation  Introduction: We present the case of a patient with a congenital heart disease.   Demographic Information: The patient is a three-month-old Caucasian baby girl by the name of Amelia. She is accompanied by her parents  who reside in the suburban parts of New York. They have no known genetic history of heart diseases nor any exposure to environmental or occupational hazards.  Amelia is the first child in her family.   Past Medical History: Amelia was born full-term and had an uneventful neonatal course apart from a prenatal diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  which was confirmed by fetal echocardiogram. She weighed 6.9 lbs at birth and her birth measurements were otherwise within normal parameters. There were no perinatal insults or need for a respiratory assistance post delivery.  Upon her post-natal checkup  Amelia was found cyanotic when crying which subsided at rest. She was further evaluated by paediatric cardiologist and the presence of a right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (known as pulmonary stenosis) and a ventricular septal defect were confirmed echocardiographically. Her saturations varied between 90-95% on room air at rest  with episodic drops to 80-85% with agitation.  Immunization history is up-to-date as per her age and there is no history of significant illness apart from her known cardiac anomaly. She has had no episodes of pneumonia or other pulmonary illnesses and no reported allergies to date.  Summary: Amelia’s congential heart disease presents as Tetralogy of Fallot  including a ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis; condition not uncommon  but requiring careful management. Her quality of life and prognosis will rely on optimal care coordination  educational support for parents and timely surgical intervention. Late diagnosis and pertinent treatment may post a significant risk to the child's health and development.
13,1,86,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial86,Presentation of Patient with Congital Heart Disease  Patient Profile:   Name: John Doe Age: 5 years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: African-American Birthplace: United States Residence: Alabama  Past Medical History:   John Doe was brought to our attention immediately after birth due to cyanosis  which prompted further examination and investigation. He was referred to pediatric cardiology where he was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a common type of congenital heart defect. TOF involves four anatomical abnormalities of the heart. This diagnosis was confirmed through echocardiography in his neonatal period.  Further examination revealed he had additional health complications including right ventricular hypertrophy and ventricular septal defect (VSD). Echocardiography also showed an overriding aorta and pulmonary stenosis.   John underwent corrective surgery when he was six months old. The operation resolved the VSD and widened his pulmonary outflow tract in the heart to reduce right ventricular outflow obstruction.   Since the surgery  he has been attending regular six-month follow-ups with his cardiologist. These have included chest X-rays  electrocardiograms  and echocardiograms to monitor his condition.   John also has a history of respiratory infections for which he has been hospitalized a couple of times.   He is currently on medication including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers  while also being continuously monitored for potential arrhythmia.   Overall  his development has been relatively normal  but physical activities are always closely monitored as they can be strenuous on his heart.   The above medical history and ongoing management plan have been fundamental in managing John's immune system and overall health. They have also significantly reduced the chances of further complications such as heart failure  arrhythmias  and other health complications linked to TOF.   In conclusion  continuous  and proactive medical care will be required throughout John's life due to his congenital heart disease. 
13,1,87,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial87,Title: Congenital Heart Disease in a Pediatric Patient  Patient Profile: The patient is a 2-month old Caucasian female infant  born at full term via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. She is currently exclusively breastfed. Her weight  height  and head circumference measurements are within the 50th percentile for her age group.   Presenting Problem: The patient was brought in by her parents due to feeding difficulties and frequent episodes of rapid breathing. They also reported the infant to tire easily even with minimal activity  such as during breastfeeding. Notably  the parents reported that the infant's lips and skin occasionally turn bluish especially during crying or feeding.   Past Medical History: The patient was not previously hospitalized or underwent surgical procedures. She received all her immunizations appropriate for her age. Prenatal history from the mother revealed no exposure to harmful medications or substances during pregnancy.   Family History: Both parents are healthy without any known congenital or genetic diseases. However  they revealed that a first cousin from the mother's side had a 'heart problem' in infancy but did not specify the type of cardiac condition.   Physical Examination: Upon physical assessment  a bluish discoloration around the lips and in the extremities was noted. The infant exhibited tachycardia and tachypnea  and there were also mild retractions observed. Heart auscultation revealed a heart murmur. All other physical findings were within normal limits for the patient's age group.   Summary: The patient's clinical presentation  history  and physical examination suggest the possible diagnosis of congenital heart disease  particularly cyanotic heart disease. This condition is apparent at birth and can often be detected by the presence of a heart murmur or bluish skin.   Recommendations: Further diagnostic investigations  such as echocardiography  are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific type of congenital heart disease. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist for further management and assessment is also advised. In untreated cases  congenital heart disease may lead to serious complications  including heart failure  growth delay  and developmental problems. Therefore  early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are key for the patient's prognosis.
13,1,88,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial88,Patient Presentation:  I present to you today  12 month-old male infant  Mason  a Caucasian  who is brought in by his parents expressing concerns regarding his consistent lethargy and poor feeding. He was born at term with a birth weight of 3.2 kg and has been noted to have slow weight gain when compared to average for his age. They also comment that Mason appears unusually breathless and sweaty after feedings.   Past Medical History:  Mason has had recurring respiratory infections since birth. His parents have also noticed that he has had a consistent bluish discoloration of his lips and fingertips  a condition known as cyanosis  which suggests he has a low oxygen level in his blood. There is no significant history of acute illnesses or hospitalizations.   He received all his recommended vaccinations up to his age. His developmental milestones are a bit delayed for his age group. He is yet to crawl and his motor skills are slower than most babies his age. His previous doctor has observed a heart murmur during a routine check-up when he was 6-months old.  Family History:  There is a history of congenital heart diseases in the family. Mason's maternal uncle had surgery for Tetralogy of Fallot as an infant. There is no other significant hereditary illness in the immediate family.  We suspect Mason is also having a congenital heart disease  likely also Tetralogy of Fallot  given the family history. Further diagnostic tests such as echocardiogram and electrocardiogram have been recommended to establish a definite diagnosis.  This case emphasizes the importance of careful monitoring of infants with a family history of heart disease and consistent monitoring of developmental milestones.
13,1,89,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial89,Title: Case Presentation of Congital Heart Disease  Patient Information: Mr. Robert Smith  a 22-year-old Caucasian male  has presented with symptoms suggestive of congenital heart disease (CHD). He is currently a student  leading a sedentary lifestyle and is a non-smoker. His current weight is 72 kg  and height is 180 cm (BMI 22.2).  Medical History: He was diagnosed as a neonate with Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart disease. During infancy  he successfully underwent a palliative shunt operation. A complete intracardiac repair was performed when he was 10 years old. According to medical records  these interventions resulted in corrections of the ventricular septal defect  obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract  and an overriding aorta.  He has no known allergies. There is neither a family history of congenital heart diseases nor other genetic disorders. The patient has been generally healthy until recently when he started developing symptoms like increased paleness  frequent fatigue and occasional episodes of breathlessness. He does not take any regular medications besides a daily multivitamin.  Clinical Exam & Findings: On examination  he appears well-grown and has a well-healed surgical scar extending vertically along the midline sternum. He has central cyanosis and clubbing of fingers. Cardiac auscultation reveals a softer than usual pulmonary valve closure sound and a systolic murmur indicative of pulmonary regurgitation.   These details highlight the need for further investigations to monitor his cardiac function  considering his previous diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot. A full cardiac circulatory examination  including echocardiography and cardiac catheterization  will be ideal to help evaluate his current cardiac status and management approach. Early detection and intervention remain crucial in managing such patients effectively.

Medical History: John was born full-term with a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. His birthweight was 3.5 kilograms  and Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes  respectively  indicating a generally healthy newborn. However  he was noted to have a heart murmur during his neonatal examination  which was not thoroughly investigated at the time.   He never had the neonatal heel prick screening test carried out  but has kept up to date with his routine immunizations as per the schedule. He has been exclusively breastfed and has maintained a satisfactory weight gain. There is no history of food or drugs allergies.  Present Complaints: For the past month  the mother has noticed episodes of cyanosis and clubbing  particularly during feeding or when John cries; these episodes are known as """"Tet spells"""". John also seems to tire easily compared to other infants his age.  Family History: There is no significant familial disorder to note. His parents are healthy non-consanguineous couple with no other children. There's no history of heart disease or any other chronic illnesses in their immediate families.  Examination: On examination  John was alert but had noticeable cyanosis and clubbing. He also had a harsh systolic ejection murmur that was audible over the left upper sternal border.   Diagnosis: The clinical features along with an echocardiograph  confirming a large subaortic ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary stenosis  overriding aorta  and right ventricular hypertrophy  confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot.  Next Steps: He is currently reviewed regularly by the pediatric cardiology team while awaiting for total corrective surgery.  This case underscores the importance of thorough evaluation of heart murmurs and other cardiac signs in neonates for early diagnosis and intervention in congenital heart disease."
13,1,91,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial91,Title: Congenital Heart Disease Patient Presentation  Patient Profile: Name: Joe Anderson Sex: Male Age: 34 Race: Caucasian Occupation: Software engineer  Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Anderson visited the clinic due to increasing bouts of breathlessness and fatigue even after minimal exertion  frequent chest pain  and a high-pitched murmur detected during a routine check-up.  Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) in infancy. His parents had made the decision against surgical closure of the VSD then  because it was small and the cardiologist expected spontaneous closure. He grew up with minimal symptoms other than occasional fatigue.  However  at the age of 12  Mr. Anderson warranted further attention due to the development of Eisenmenger syndrome. He was administered medication to manage his symptoms  and continued with regular follow-up visits to monitor his heart condition.  Over the years  Mr. Anderson was also diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and was treated accordingly. He has never smoked  consumes alcohol moderately  and does not involve himself in any strenuous physical activity due to fatigue.  He has no other known chronic conditions like hypertension  diabetes  or any infectious diseases. However  he has a family history of heart disease; his mother had dilated cardiomyopathy.  Current Medications: He is currently on Bosentan (62.5 mg twice daily) for pulmonary hypertension and Aspirin  81 mg daily as a blood thinner.  Conclusion: Mr. Anderson is a 34-year-old male  with a congenital cardiac defect and related comorbidities  who presents with worsening fatigue  breathlessness  chest pain and a noticeable murmur. This indicates disease progression or the presence of complications. Urgent attention is required for the reassessment of his congenital heart condition and adjustments to his medical management plan. This panel discussion will focus on his current state and plan of action for further management of his congenital heart disease.

The delivery was normal and the child was born at 39 weeks. However  since birth  the parents reported that the child seemed lethargic and had difficulty feeding.   Past Medical History:  The child has not been hospitalized or undergone surgery previously. There are no known allergies. Immunizations are up to date and in accordance with the age-level recommendations. He has failed to gain weight according to the age-standard criteria and his growth seems proportionately smaller compared to the average 5-month-old baby.   In addition  the infant often appears to be cyanotic  especially during feeding and bouts of crying. He also regurgitates a significant amount of milk after every feeding session.   This could suggest a diagnosis of congenital heart disease  particularly Tetralogy of Fallot or a Ventricular Septal Defect  which can present with symptoms such as poor growth  difficulty in feeding  and cyanosis in infants.   Family History:  There is no known family history of congenital heart diseases  heart failures  premature deaths  or similar cardiac conditions noted in the grandparents  parents or siblings. However  there is a history of hypertension in both maternal and paternal sides of the family.  Social History:  The family lives in a suburban community. Both parents are non-smokers and do not consume drugs or alcohol.   In conclusion  due to the reported symptoms  further diagnostic tests  such as an echocardiogram  should be performed immediately to confirm the diagnosis of a possible congenital heart defect in the child. The infant's symptoms are a cause for concern  and they persistently hinder him from completing essential daily activities like feeding and sleeping.   All these factors combined signal a need for prompt intervention and treatment to manage and improve his condition.
13,1,93,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial93,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Congital Heart Disease (CHD)  Patient Identification: The patient is a 6-month old Asian female infant named Lily. She presented with her mother at the outpatient department of our hospital.  Chief Complaint: The child's mother reported that Lily seems to tire easily  particularly while feeding and appears to be growing slower than normal for her age group. She also noticed that Lily often has rapid breathing and profuse sweating even in the absence of physical exertion.  History of Present Illness: Lily was born full term via spontaneous normal delivery. However  at birth  she had a bluish color to her skin attributed to low oxygen levels in her blood. Her body weight and height have been consistently below the 50th percentile for her age. Over the last two weeks  her symptoms such as tiring and sweating have been progressively worsening.  Past Medical History: Lily was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of complex heart defect  soon after birth during her neonatal checks. This condition has been managed conservatively.  Family History: The mother denies history of congenital heart disease or genetic disorders in the family. None of the siblings or relatives have presented similar symptoms.  Examination: General examination shows her to be alert  but with mildly reduced activity level. She has a slight bluish discoloration of her lips and fingernails  confirming cyanosis. Cardiac examination revealed a systolic murmur. Her heart rate is slightly elevated  and respiratory rate reveals mild tachypnea.  In conclusion  Lily's clinical presentation and examination  along with her known diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  is suggestive of her congenital heart disease progressing. Next steps include additional diagnostic evaluation such as an echocardiogram and consultation with a pediatric cardiologist to evaluate the need for surgical intervention. This is crucial to prevent further complications related to her congenital heart disease.
13,1,94,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial94,Patient Presentation:  Demographic Information: We have a 3-month-old male infant  of Caucasian heritage. His parents are non-consanguineous with no significant familial medical history. The family resides in rural Minnesota with routine access to healthcare.  Past Medical History:  The patient was born at term via normal vaginal delivery with no complications. His mother had regular prenatal care  and ultrasound imaging was not suggestive of any anomalies. His birth weight was 3.2 kg and height was 50 cm within normal limits. His neonatal period was uneventful. However  he frequently exhibited poor feeding  rapid breathing  and excessive sweating  especially during feeding.   Given his symptoms  he was evaluated  and an echocardiogram was performed showing a congenital heart abnormality. The diagnosis was Tetralogy of Fallot  which is a rare type of congenital heart disease that includes four heart defects: a ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary stenosis  a misplaced aorta  and a thickened right ventricular wall (right ventricular hypertrophy).   Since the diagnosis  the patient has been under close monitoring by the pediatric cardiology team. He was started on oxygen and medications to help with managing the heart failure symptoms  and he'll need surgery as soon as he can safely tolerate it. Additional evaluations including kidney and other organ system evaluations have been normal. Despite these challenges  his developmental milestones thus far are within the normal range for his age.  Family History:  Parents and sibling (2-year-old sister) are healthy. There is no family history of congenital heart disease or other genetic disorders.  In conclusion  this presentation concerns a 3-month-old boy diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot  currently managed with medications and anticipated for corrective surgery.
13,1,95,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial95,Presentation of a Patient with Congenital Heart Disease   Patient Information:  Name: Emily Sanders  Age: 6-months-old  Gender: Female  Race: Caucasian  Nationality: American  Presenting Problems:   Emily presents with congestive heart failure and recurrent respiratory tract infections. Symptoms include shortness of breath  poor feeding  cyanosis (blue tinge to the skin)  rapid heartbeat  and poor weight gain.   Past Medical History:   Emily was born full term via vaginal delivery with no complications reported during pregnancy. At birth  she had a low Apgar score. In her neonatal period  she faced issues of poor weight gain and recurrent infections  despite regular feeding. She was later diagnosed with a failure to thrive.   She has been hospitalised twice over the past few months due to respiratory infection. Recent chest X-ray showed an enlargement of the heart. A subsequent electrocardiogram and echocardiogram revealed structural abnormalities in the heart  confirming a diagnosis of congenital heart disease. It has been established that Emily has a ventricular septal defect.  Family History:  Mother is a healthy 28-years-old with no known chronic diseases. Father is a 30-year-old with a history of hypertension and Type II diabetes. There is no known family history of congenital heart disease.   Conclusion:   Emily Sanders is a 6-month-old female who is presenting with symptoms indicating congenital heart disease  specifically a ventricular septal defect. Given her recurring respiratory infections  poor weight gain  unexplained fatigue and heart abnormality seen in diagnostic procedures  further investigations and potential cardiac surgery should be considered. It is important to manage this case delicately due to Emily's age and monitor her progress closely for improved growth and recovery.   This case reminds us that  while congenital heart diseases can often be diagnosed antenatally  some may not present until after birth and may initially present with non-specific symptoms such as failure to thrive. A high degree of suspicion should therefore always be observed.
13,1,96,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial96,Patient Profile Presentation  Patient Name: John Doe Age: 2 years old Sex: Male Ethnicity: African-American  Presenting Problem: Congenital Heart Disease  John is a 2-year-old African-American boy who has been diagnosed with congenital heart disease. He was referred due to noticeable cyanosis  rapid breathing  swelling in his legs  abdomen  and areas around the eyes  and poor feeding.  Medical History:   Our young patient was born full-term via normal vaginal delivery  but from the neonatal period  John had difficulties in feeding accompanied by profuse sweating. He has had numerous hospital admissions due to recurrent chest infections.  Family History:   John's mother had regular prenatal check-ups and no significant complications were reported during her pregnancy. Both parents are healthy  and there is no known family history of heart disease or other chronic illness.  Diagnosis:  Upon further assessment including echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization  John was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart disease. This condition comprises four heart defects that present together including ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  a misplaced aorta and a thickened right ventricular wall (right ventricular hypertrophy).  Management:  The treatment plan for John includes both pharmacotherapy and possible surgical interventions. In initial stages  he has been placed on Beta Blockers - Propranolol to control his hypercyanotic episodes.   However  in the long term  he will require a complete repair surgery that comprises patch closure of the VSD and relief of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. This generally provides an excellent prognosis  and most children grow up to lead normal lives with regular cardiology follow-ups.   Parents have been extensively counseled about the nature of John's condition  the requirements for ongoing care  and the importance of regular follow-ups with the pediatric cardiologist. John has been scheduled for his surgical procedure  and a preoperative cardiac assessment will be done accordingly.   The case requires an interdisciplinary team approach incorporating pediatric cardiologists  pediatricians  surgeons  nutritionists  and a dedicated nursing staff to provide optimal care. Efforts will also be made to refer the family to relevant support groups who are dealing with the same condition to help them cope better with the situation.
13,1,97,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial97,Title: Congenital Heart Disease in a Pediatric Patient  Introduction:  Today  we are presenting a 6-month-old Caucasian female who has been diagnosed with congenital heart disease.   Demographic Information:  The patient  Emma Smith  was born in this city  and currently resides with her both parents. She has an older sibling who is healthy with no documented congenital abnormalities.   Past Medical History:  Emma was born full term via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. Her mother had a healthy pregnancy with regular prenatal care. Emma's birth weight and other vitals were within a normal range. No immediate postnatal issues were reported  and the newborn screening tests were also normal.  From her birth to about 4 months of age  Emma had typical development and milestone achievements according to her age. Around 4 months  the parents began noticing that Emma was not gaining weight adequately and showed dyspnea while feeding  along with irritability.   On examining  we noticed that Emma appeared pale and showed signs of fatigue and sweatiness  especially after feeding. An abnormal heart sound (heart murmur) was detected during her physical exam  which invited further investigations.   Medical Investigations:  The Chest X-ray displayed cardiac enlargement. An echocardiogram confirmed our suspicion of a congenital heart defect - Atrioventricular Septal Defect (AVSD). This was characterized by a hole in the center of the heart impacting the way blood flows through the heart.   Management and Prognosis:  Emma was referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further evaluation and management. She will likely require surgical intervention in her first year of life.   The parents were assured that with early detection  proper surgical management  and regular follow-up visits  most children with AVSD can lead healthy lives. However  they were counseled about the complications related to the condition and the surgical intervention  including the potential for future need of surgeries or medical management.  Finally  the need for psychological and social support was emphasized due to the chronic nature of their child’s illness for meeting their child’s healthcare needs effectively. We connected them with a local support group for parents of children with congenital heart defects.  Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the importance of early detection and intervention in cases of congenital heart diseases  like AVSD. With proper care and treatment  these children have the chance to lead full  healthy lives.
13,1,98,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial98,Title: Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) in a Middle-Aged Woman   Good afternoon  everyone   Today I am introducing a patient who has been diagnosed with Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD). The aim is to understand her condition better and to provide patient-centric care that helps in managing her condition effectively.   Patient's Demographic Information: Our patient  Ms. Sophia Williams  is a 45-year-old Caucasian woman. She currently resides in Chicago  Illinois and works as a high school math teacher. She is a non-smoker and moderate drinker. She has no children and lives with her long-term partner.  Medical History: Ms. Williams was born with a congenital heart disease known as Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). She underwent corrective open-heart surgery in her infancy  followed by upkeep treatment during her adolescence.   For the past few years  Ms. Williams has been complaining of decreased exercise tolerance  occasional chest pain  and palpitations  which are seen frequently in adults with congenital heart disease. She also reported experiencing fatigue more rapidly than her colleagues or friends of the same age. All these uncomfortable symptoms have alarmed her  prompting her visit to the clinic this week.   She has no known allergies. Her father was known to have an Ischaemic Heart Disease  and her mother has type 2 diabetes. She does not have any significant surgical history apart from her corrective heart surgery when she was a child.   On her last checkup  2 years ago  Ms. Williams' cardiologist emphasized the need for routine follow-ups and advised on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. She has been on medication  including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors  but her recent symptoms raise concerns over her condition's stability.   In conclusion  with the current symptoms in view of her past medical history and considering her family's cardiac history  it is prudent to evaluate Ms. Williams' cardiac function through appropriate imaging tests and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Furthermore  adjustments in her medications might be needed depending on the results of these tests. Coping strategies along with lifestyle modifications should be explored as part of managing her Adult Congenital Heart Disease.   The objective is to ensure that Ms. Williams not only survives but also thrives  living a good-quality life despite her congenital heart disease.   Thank you for your attention  and remember  always 'Heart first!' in patient care.
13,1,99,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial99,Presentation of Patient:    Patient Information:   Patient’s Name:  Baby John Doe Age:  6 months old Sex:  Male Race: Caucasian Birthdate: July 1  2021 Address: 1234 Main Street  Small Town  Vermont Emergency Contact: Jane Doe  Mother  Medical History:  Baby John was born at 38 weeks via a scheduled Caesarian-section due to placenta previa. He had a birth weight of 3000g. His Apgar scores were 7 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Baby John had difficulty feeding in his first few weeks of life. He tended to sweat profusely  especially during feedings  along with showing signs of rapid breathing and early fatigue. His growth was also slower in contrast to other healthy infants of his age.  He was initially admitted to neonatal intensive care unit due to persistent cyanosis and a heart murmur detected few days after birth. His pulse oximetry test showed lower than normal level. An echocardiogram performed at that time highlighted structural abnormalities in his heart with a possible diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot.  He was discharged once stable  with advice for follow-up regular check-ups and monitoring of his growth and cardiac status. He has been on medications to manage his symptoms and is scheduled for a repair surgery. There is no record of any other chronic illnesses or genetic disorders in the family.  Conclusion:  This 6-month old baby boy presents a case of complex congenital heart disease. His parents have been informed of his condition and are working closely with the pediatric cardiologist  pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon  and other pediatric sub-specialists for a comprehensive management and surgical plan. Regular follow-ups  improved feeding techniques  and strict medication adherence are critical for the baby’s growth and development.
13,1,100,diagnosis13-prompt1-trial100,Title: Case Presentation of Congital Heart Disease  Patient Information:  We have a 6-month-old male infant  Caucasian ethnicity  presenting today with an early diagnosis of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). The parents are non-smokers and report no exposure to drugs or alcohol during the pregnancy. The baby was born at full-term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivered via spontaneous vaginal delivery. There is no family history of congenital heart diseases  genetic disorders or other significant illnesses.   Past Medical History:  The child has regularly visited a pediatrician since birth  with his immunizations reported to be up to date. He was initially noted to have difficulty feeding and was confirmed to have failure to thrive at his 4-month-old checkup. Subsequently  he was referred to a pediatric cardiologist for evaluation of potential cardiac issues due to the manifestation of symptoms such as breathlessness and fatigue.   Symptoms: The infant presents with a history of poor feeding  slower than average weight gain  excessive sweating  rapid breathing  and overexertion resulting in prolonged  frequent naps. Additionally  the patient was detected to have a heart murmur during a regular check-up  which further raised the suspicion of a heart defect.  These symptoms suggest an infant experiencing congestive heart failure secondary to an untreated CHD. Upon further diagnosis using radiographic imaging and lab tests  the type of CHD along with the severity of this case can be appropriately determined and managed to optimize the child's health status.
13,2,1,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial1,Patient Presentation: A 2-month old Asian-American male infant  Jackson  presents to the pediatric cardiology clinic accompanied by his parents. The infant was born preterm at 32 weeks gestation and spent the first month of life in the neonatal intensive care unit. Birth weight was 1200 grams. The parents report trouble feeding and the baby not gaining enough weight over the past few weeks. They also noted the baby tends to sweat excessively during feeding and frequently seems tired. Family history is significant for congenital heart disease with the mother having undergone surgery for a coarctation of the aorta as a child. The parents  who are both non-smokers  report no genetic disorders  illnesses  or notable environmental exposures during pregnancy. There is no history of alcohol or drug use by the mother during pregnancy.   On physical examination  the baby is tachypneic with slight difficulty in breathing. There is a presence of central cyanosis signified by bluish coloration of the skin  lips  and tongue. The pediatrician also noted a loud  harsh (holosystolic) murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. At this time  possible congenital heart disease is suspected. Further diagnostic imaging (an Echocardiogram) and genetic counseling referrals are made. The parents are provided resources on congenital heart disease and the family's psychosocial needs are assessed.
13,2,2,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial2,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Jones is a 25-year-old African American male who presented to the clinic complaining of fatigue  shortness of breath  and palpitations. He stated that these symptoms have been occurring intermittently for the past year  but have worsened in the past two weeks. He has been otherwise healthy throughout his life. He has no significant family history of heart disease.  In review of his prenatal and childhood medical records  it was noted that he received a diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot during infancy  for which he underwent a corrective surgical procedure. He followed up with a pediatric cardiologist throughout his childhood and adolescence  and his routine monitoring and checks were reported as normal.  He denies any history of smoking  alcohol  or recreational drug use. He is currently unemployed and lives alone. He is not on any medication and has no known allergies. He has never been hospitalized except for his surgery during infancy.  On physical examination  Mr. Jones is visibly distressed with mild cyanosis. His heart rate is regular with mild tachycardia  blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg  oxygen saturation is 91% on room air  respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Jugular venous pressure (JVP) is slightly elevated and his fingers show clubbing. On auscultation  there is a harsh systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. His lungs are clear on auscultation. The rest of the examination is unremarkable.
13,2,3,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial3,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 1-month-old female infant  named Jessa  brought by her parents to the pediatric cardiology clinic. She has Filipino ancestry and was born in the United States. She hasn't been gaining weight well since her birth  which was full-term with no complications.  Background:  From birth  Jessa has been showing signs of fatigue and dyspnea during feedings. Her mother reports that Jessa also has cyanosis  particularly around the lips  during crying and feeding. Further  she noticed Jessa occasionally becoming less responsive  with these symptoms increasing progressively over the last 2 weeks.   Past Medical History:  Jessa is the first child of non-consanguineous parents. Prenatal ultrasound reports were within normal limits  and she had no prior hospital admissions. On birth  she weighed 3.2kg and was diagnosed with a systolic murmur during her first pediatric visit at one week old. There is no significant family history of cardiac diseases  however  her paternal grandfather was diagnosed with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.   No other medical issues or comorbidities are present in infant Jessa.   On physical examination  central and peripheral cyanosis is present. She has a resting heart rate of 155 bpm and mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. Her pulses were bounding in quality. Cardiac auscultation reveals a loud  harsh systolic ejection murmur in the upper left sternal border and an S2 that was loud and single.   This clinical picture makes one suspect a congenital heart disease  like Tetralogy of Fallot or Truncus Arteriosus. Further evaluations with echocardiogram and chest X-ray have been arranged.
13,2,4,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial4,Patient Information: A 5-month-old Hispanic male infant is brought to the clinic by his mother for a routine checkup. The patient was born at full-term through normal vaginal delivery  with a birth weight of 3.2 kg. He has normal developmental milestones for his age but his mother noticed that he gets tired more easily during feeding and sweats a lot  mostly around his head. Mother also mentioned about the bluish discoloration of his skin  particularly his lips and fingers when crying. He has no siblings with similar condition.   Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) via an echocardiogram at the age of 2 months  which was further confirmed by a pediatric cardiologist. He was asymptomatic at that time. The patient has received all the immunizations appropriate to his age.   Family History: There is no family history of congenital heart disease  hypertension  diabetes or asthma. Both parents are in good health.   Medication: The patient is not on any medication.   Allergies: There are no known drug or food allergies.    Physical Examination: On general examination  the patient appears to be tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 45 breaths/min  pulse rate of 160 beats/min and mild cyanosis noted on lips and fingers. Anthropometric measurements were taken and below the 50th percentile for weight and height  considering his age and ethnicity.   Cardiac Examination: Cardiac examination reveals a grade 4/6 holosystolic murmur at left lower sternal border.   Investigations: The patient is subsequently scheduled for follow-up investigations including a repeat echocardiogram and Electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess the severity of his condition. Respiratory infectious workup should also be considered given the presenting symptoms.   Plan: The tentative plan will be to manage the condition conservatively and evaluate the need for surgical intervention based on the progression of VSD. The patient's mother is educated about the nature of the condition and the signs that necessitate immediate medical attention. Regular follow-ups are reinforced for continuous monitoring of the baby's condition and growth parameters.
13,2,5,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial5,Patient Presentation  The patient is a 3-month-old Hispanic female named Ella González who is brought to the clinic by her mother for a scheduled well-child check. Ella was born full-term via C-section without any apparent complications and has a birth weight of 7 pounds and 2 ounces. The family's medical history does not include any other siblings or relatives with congenital abnormalities or heart disease.   Ms. González reports that Ella has been experiencing difficulty in feeding and tends to struggle with breathlessness. She also noticed that the baby often sweats excessively while feeding and an unexplained color change with a bluish tinge around Ella's lips and fingertips - a condition termed as cyanosis.   There are no history of high-grade fevers  non-projective vomiting  digestive problems  abnormal weight loss  or developmental delays for Ella. The mother also disclosed that Ella's crying and fussiness has increased recently  and the baby often seems lethargic compared to few weeks ago.  The maternal history reveals a healthy pregnancy with regular prenatal care. There is no maternal history of illicit drug use  alcohol use  or smoking. Mother did not have any infections or take medications during pregnancy. The mother’s prenatal labs were all normal including a negative result for group B strep  HIV  hepatitis B and rubella immunity.  On physical examination  the baby is seen to be smaller compared to other infants of the same age (below the 5th percentile for weight and height). Heart auscultation reveals a heart murmur. Her respiratory rate is 42 breaths per minute and the heart rhythm is regular at a rate of 130 beats per minute. No hepatic or splenic enlargement is palpated.   The clinical presentation of failure to thrive  symptoms of heart failure  and physical examination findings suggestive of congenital heart defect warrants further testing and consultation with a pediatric cardiologist.
13,2,6,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial6,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 2-month-old male infant  Asian  brought in by his parents. Parents report that they've noticed that he becomes quite blue during feeding and during moments of intense crying. They have also observed that he breathes faster and harder in comparison to his elder sibling when a similar age. Weight gain has been slower than expected.   Past Medical History:  The mother had a standard prenatal course with no consumption of alcohol  illegal substances or exposure to radiation. She did have an episode of fever during the first trimester. The infant was born at term  with a birth weight of 3.5 kg. There were no neonatal complications.   Family History:  The paternal grandfather had a history of heart disease. There is no other family history of congenital heart disorders.   Based on the above findings  the patient is suspected to be suffering from a form of cyanotic congenital heart disease  possibly tetralogy of Fallot or transposition of the great arteries. Further diagnostic tests  including an echocardiogram  are advised to confirm the diagnosis.
13,2,7,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial7,Patient Initials: MG   Gender: Male   Age: 6 years   Race: Caucasian  Presenting Issue: The patient has been experiencing fatigue  shortness of breath with mild exertion  and frequent respiratory infections.

Plan: The history and clinical findings indicate congenital heart disease  likely a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). Advise an echocardiogram for confirmed diagnosis and consult pediatric cardiologist for further management."
13,2,9,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial9,Patient Information: Baby girl  4-month-old  Asian descent  Presenting Complaint: The patient’s mother brought her to the clinic due to difficulty feeding  extreme fatigue  excessive sweating  and a bluish color seen on the lips and skin.  History: The patient was born 4 months ago at term with no reported complications during pregnancy. However  she was in the neonatal ICU due to low birth weight and spent two weeks there before discharge. She wasn't gaining enough weight and had feeding difficulties since birth.   Past Medical History: The child has no personal past medical history  but the mother reported a family history of congenital heart disease on her maternal side. She also shared that she had been exposed to certain medications during the initial period of her pregnancy.  Review of Systems: The infant became easily tired during feeding and thus not able to eat well  causing a lack of weight gain. She also showed signs of rapid breathing  profuse sweating particularly with activity  and bluish skin color.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  the baby appeared underweight and cyanotic particularly on her lips  fingernails  and toenails. A murmur was detected on cardiac auscultation.   Summary: A full-term 4-month-old Asian baby girl  presented with poor feeding  tires easily particularly during feeds  excessive sweating  rapid respiration  and cyanosis. Mother reported a family history of congenital heart disease. With these presenting symptoms and significant family history  further investigations were planned to rule out congenital heart disease. 
13,2,10,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial10,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 3-year-old Hispanic female who presents with symptoms of poor feeding  slow weight gain  and excessive fatigue. The patient's mother reports that the child often exhibits shortness of breath during regular playtime activities and seems to tire quickly. In addition  the child has experienced frequent bouts of bronchitis  which seem to be more severe than typical common respiratory infections.   Past Medical History:  The child was full-term with no complications at birth  but prenatal ultrasound indicated the possibility of structural abnormality in the heart. The child was born via cesarean section and was back to back breached. The patient's mother also states that she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during pregnancy. The patient has no history of serious injury or surgery. Family history reveals that the patient's father has a known history of bicuspid aortic valve  a type of congenital heart disease.   Known Allergies: None reported  Medications: The patient is not currently on any medications  Immunizations: Up to date according to age.  Social History: The patient lives with both parents and has one older sibling  a 5-year-old brother. The family does not own any pets and neither parent is a smoker. The home environment is clean and safe. The patient attends preschool three days a week.   Physical Examination:  The patient’s weight and height are below normal range for her age. On examination  a heart murmur is detected. Peri-orbital and pedal edema is also noted.   These symptoms and signs could indicate a possible congenital heart disease  and further diagnostic tests such as an echocardiogram should be conducted to establish the diagnosis.
13,2,11,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial11,Patient Presentation:   A 3-month-old Asian male infant was brought to the pediatric clinic by his parents today. They are first-time parents who immigrated from China two years ago. The infant was born full-term with a normal vaginal delivery but had a low birth weight of 2.4kg. He was up-to-date on all his immunizations.   Complaint: The parents noted that the child appears cyanotic  especially under stress  and they felt he was not gaining weight normally.   History: Further history revealed that he has been having some difficulty feeding  often becoming sweaty and out of breath during feeds. He was having more frequent respiratory infections than they expected for an infant.   Examination: Upon physical examination  the infant appeared slightly blue in color and was breathing heavily. He was underweight for his age. On auscultation  a loud palpable murmur was heard.   Past Medical History: The patient has been previously hospitalized for respiratory tract infections three times since birth  required a short course of oxygen therapy during the last admission. There is no significant family history of congenital anomalies or heart diseases.   Considering the history of cyanosis  poor weight gain  difficulty during feeding  recurrent respiratory infections  and the presence of a noticeable murmur  the clinician suspected a congenital heart disease in the infant and referred him for further diagnostic evaluations.   Risk Factors: Parents are non-consanguineous  and there’s no known prenatal exposure to illness  drugs or alcohol. Low birth weight and ethnicity (Asian descent) could potentially contribute. The first-time parent status of the mother and father might have led to late recognition of symptoms.   This patient presentation overall suggests a possible cyanotic congenital heart disease.

13,2,28,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial28,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Jane Doe is a 6-month-old Caucasian female infant who is brought in by her parents for a regular check-up. Her parents have noted that she seems to tire easily during feedings  and they also mention that she appears bluish following bouts of crying or feeding.  The patient was born full-term  with no significant prenatal or postnatal complications. She was  however  delivered via cesarean section because of the mother's previous complications with vaginal deliveries. The child is exclusively breastfed and her growth parameters have significantly lagged behind the standard child development milestones; her height  weight  and head circumference are within the 10th percentile for her age.   Family history reveals no significant incidence of any cardiovascular disease. There are no siblings. Jane was up-to-date with her infant vaccinations but  due to the suspected issue at hand  immunization has been set on hold until further notice.  Suspicion for a congenital heart condition was first raised during prenatal ultrasounds  but no definitive diagnostic tests were performed during pregnancy. Jane's current physical examination reveals an underweight but alert infant exhibiting cyanosis and diaphoresis  increased rate of breathing  and a gallop rhythm upon cardiac auscultation. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation level of 88% on room air.   The combination of parental observations  prenatal red flags  current physical signs and developmental delay strongly suggest a congenital heart defect  potentially a cyanotic one. Immediate consultation with a pediatric cardiologist is recommended for further evaluation and management.
13,2,29,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial29,Patient Information: Female  6-month-old infant  mixed ethnicity   Presenting Complaint: The patient's mother reports a history of poor feeding  rapid breathing  and less activity than other babies of this age.   History of Present Complaint: Mother has been concerned for the past two months about the baby’s consistently bluish skin  especially on lips and fingertips.

There is no known family history of congenital heart diseases.  Immunization Status: The patient is up to date with all recommended immunizations according to the CDC's Immunization Schedule.  Other Relevant History: There was no maternal use of recreational drugs  alcohol  or tobacco during pregnancy. Mother had regular antenatal checkups; no anomalies were detected on prenatal ultrasounds. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated  suggesting the heart defect wasn't detected or didn't develop until after birth.  Social History: The mother is a university graduate  and the father is employed. They live together in a stable home environment.   Clinical Findings: Upon examination  the baby appears cyanotic  especially around her lips and hands. She appears sweaty and breathless. She has noticeable difficulty feeding and tends to sweat profusely during feeds. Heart sounds reveal a pronounced murmur. The infant’s weight gain appears to be slower than the average for her age group.   Impression: The symptoms and physical findings are suggestive of a congenital heart disease  possibly cyanotic  which commands immediate attention. More specialized tests including echocardiography and chest X-ray are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and understand the extent and nature of her heart condition.
13,2,30,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial30,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 6-month-old female infant named Mia who is brought to the pediatrician's office by her mother who noticed that Mia gets tired quickly during feeds and she sweats more than usual. She also mentioned that Mia attends her wellness checks and has updated routine immunizations. According to the mother  Mia's weight gain has been slower compare to the average weight for a baby her age. There are no records of fever  cough  respiratory distress  or seizure.   Mia was born full-term via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery and has no history of NICU admission or any known childhood illnesses. There is no history of sudden death or congenital heart disease in her immediate or extended family. Both parents are non-smokers and the pregnancy was unremarkable.  Upon physical examination  the infant appeared generally well but with notable paleness. The pediatrician observed cyanosis around Mia's mouth  especially upon crying. Her SpO2 levels were found to be 86%  indicating low oxygen levels. On auscultation  a heart murmur was heard.   Given the mother’s concern  the physical examination findings  and Mia's slow weight gain and feeding difficulties  the pediatrician suspects a congenital heart disease. Further tests like an Echocardiogram  Chest X-Ray  and Electrocardiogram are recommended to confirm the diagnosis.
13,2,31,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial31,Patient Presentation:  A 3-month-old female infant is brought in to the clinic by her parents. The parents are a 32-year-old mother and a 34-year-old father of Caucasian decent. They report that their daughter has been experiencing difficulty gaining weight and seems to tire easily when drinking from a bottle. Additionally  they have started noticing a bluish tint to her lips and skin when she's feeding or crying.  The patient was delivered at term with no known complications during pregnancy or birth. Birth weight was 3.2 kg and Apgar score was 9 at both 1 and 5 minutes. She had routine prenatal examinations and all relevant blood tests  ultrasounds  and screening tests for chromosomal abnormalities were normal.   The infant does not have any known allergies. Immunizations are up to date according to CDC recommendations. Medical history is only remarkable for a few common illnesses such as cold and mild fever in the first month of life. The baby does not take any medications.   Family history is notable for a paternal uncle who had some type of heart surgery as a child  but details are not known. There's no history of sudden cardiac death or early onset heart disease in family.   Growth and developmental milestones are slightly below average for her age. She is able to hold her head up for brief periods of time  but struggles to do so for prolonged periods. She coos and reacts to noises  but has not yet started to babble. She is slowly gaining weight  but is not at the expected weight for her age.  The patient appears healthy at first glance  but has a noticeable blue-ish tint to her lips and slightly on her fingers. She is not in visible distress  but becomes tired easily and sweats excessively when crying. Physical examination is remarkable for central cyanosis  a heart murmur  and failure to thrive. These findings are strongly indicative of congenital heart disease  likely causing poor weight gain and cyanotic episodes.  Further tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific type of congenital heart disease.
13,2,32,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial32,Patient Information: A six-week old female  Hispanic  weighing 4.5 kg  delivered full-term at local hospital.  Chief Complaint: Recurrent episodes of cyanosis while feeding and increased irritability.   History of Present Illness: The mother reports episodes of the child turning blue while feeding  which started around the third week of life. Previous doctor visits were unremarkable.

There is a family history of congenital heart disease from the baby's paternal side; the father underwent corrective surgery for a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) during infancy. The baby does not have any known allergies and doesn't take any medications.  On physical examination  the infant appeared dysmorphic and cyanotic. Upon auscultation  there was a noticeable heart murmur. These symptoms  combined with the prenatal ultrasound findings and family medical history  indicate a possible diagnosis of congenital heart disease.

On examination  a systolic murmur is heard on precordial auscultation.   Impression: The patient's symptoms and clinical picture are consistent with possible congenital heart disease  most probably cyanotic. Specialist referral is necessary for the definitive diagnosis and management options.
13,2,41,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial41,Patient Information: A 2-month-old Hispanic male infant is brought to the pediatric clinic by his mother who reports of blue discoloration around the baby's mouth and tongue  particularly while feeding.   Chief Complaint: Cyanosis and difficulty in feeding  History of Present Illness: The mother noticed mild bluish discoloration around the baby's mouth and tongue about 2 weeks ago. Over the recent week  she noticed the baby gets breathless while feeding. She also reports that the baby is not gaining weight as expected for his age.   Past Medical History: The pregnancy and delivery were uneventful. The baby was born full term with a birth weight of 3.3 kg. There are no known allergies. This is her first child. There is no history of any significant illness since birth.   Family History: There is no known history of the congenital heart disease or sudden adult death syndrome in the family. The mother had not taken any harmful substances or medications during pregnancy.   Physical Examination: On examination  the baby has a bluish discoloration around his mouth and tongue  which gets more intense upon crying. He has a heart rate of 160 beats per minute  a respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute  a temperature of 98.8°F and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Upon chest auscultation  there is evidence of a heart murmur.   Assessment: The presentation is suggestive of cyanotic congenital heart disease  which could possibly be Tetralogy of Fallot or transposition of great arteries.   Plan: The baby should be referred for an echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis. Once the type of congenital heart disease is identified  a treatment plan may include medications  procedures  surgery  or a combination thereof. Potential intervention should be discussed with the parents.
13,2,42,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial42,Patient Presentation:  A 6-month old Caucasian female infant  brought in by her parents to the clinic for regular pediatric follow-up. The patient was born full-term via vaginal birth with no complications. Both parents remain in good health with no significant family history of congenital heart disease or other hereditary conditions.    During birth  the infant was found to have cyanosis  with subsequent echocardiogram confirming the presence of Tetralogy of Fallot - a congenital heart defect. The parents report intermittent episodes of the baby turning blue  especially during feeding or crying  which are telltale signs of the disease. The infant has been struggling with feeding and has poor weight gain.  Examination reveals a grade III/VI systolic murmur  best heard over the left upper sternal border. Pulse oximetry shows low blood oxygen levels. The baby is slightly smaller for her age due to growth retardation. The patient had undergone prostaglandin E1 infusion right after birth to keep the ductus arteriosus open and avoid a cyanotic spell before heart surgical repair  which was planned at six months of life.  This is the baby's initial cardiac consultation visit. She is already planned for a complete surgical repair in a couple of weeks. The family is anxious and has been provided further counseling on the condition  the scheduled surgical procedure  and post-operative care. 
13,2,43,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial43,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 2-week-old Caucasian female who was brought in for a well-baby checkup. The infant was born full-term with uncomplicated vaginal delivery and had an unremarkable newborn hospital course. Over the course of the past week  the parents report the baby to have become progressively more irritable with feeding  exhibiting cyanosis  and increased work of breathing. They also report that the baby seems to be all the time sweaty and not gaining weight as expected.  Relevant Past Medical History:  The baby was born to a healthy 28-year-old mother with no prior pregnancies or miscarriages. The mother received routine prenatal care. The course of pregnancy was uneventful  with no maternal illnesses  substance use  infections  or exposure to environmental toxins reported. The infant was discharged from the hospital in good condition with documented normal physical findings and direct Coombs negative. The family history includes a paternal uncle who was diagnosed with congenital heart disease.
13,2,44,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial44,Patient Presentation:  I am conducting a physical examination on a 4-month-old  female infant  born full-term with no immediate complications at birth. The patient is Hispanic-American presented by her mother due to persistent respiratory issues since birth  increased irritability  and poor weight gain since her 2-month-old visit. She has no known drug allergies and is currently not on any medications.  She comes from a non-consanguineous marriage. However  her family history reveals that her maternal uncle had some childhood heart problem which was surgically corrected. She was normally vaccinated for her age and showed a slight delay in reaching her developmental milestones  such as poor head control and not responding effectively to light and sounds.  Upon inspection  she seems tachypneic with increased use of accessory muscles and a pulse oximetry reading of 87%. Additionally  she exhibits mild peripheral cyanosis and a pale-ish complexion. On cardiac examination  there is a palpable thrill in the parasternal region with a characteristic harsh holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border.  These findings suggest the possibility of congenital heart disease  further emphasized by prominent respiratory symptoms alongside a characteristic murmur. Echo-cardiogram and consultation with a pediatric cardiologist are advised for further management.
13,2,45,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial45,Patient Presentation:  A two-month-old Caucasian male  J.D.  born full-term without complications  is brought to the pediatrician's office by his parents for a routine well-child visit. The child's mother has been worried about occasional cyanosis noted around the infant's lips during feedings. His parents deny fever  cough  or increase in respiratory rate in the child. His mother admits to a lack of noticeable weight gain since his last visit one month ago.  The family history is significant for a paternal cousin who had surgery for congenital heart disease in infancy. The patient's prenatal history is unremarkable and his mother denied use of drugs  alcohol  or tobacco during pregnancy.  Physical examination finds the baby to weigh 4.5 kg (below the 5th percentile for his age)  and he is quiet and alert. Mild cyanosis is noted around his lips and tongue. His pulse is 120 beats per minute and regular  with a single audible S2 heart sound and a grade III harsh systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border. His respiration rate is 32 breaths per minute  and lung examination finds clear lung fields.  In summary  J.D. is a two-month-old male infant presenting with poor weight gain  cyanosis  and an audible murmur  suggestive of a possible congenital heart disease. His family history of congenital heart disease further increases this suspicion.
13,2,46,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial46,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 2-week-old male infant  twin B of a dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy  presented in the pediatric clinic by his mother for a follow-up.  Demographic Details:  The child's mother is a 35-year-old Caucasian woman with an uncomplicated prenatal history. No alcohol  tobacco  or illicit drug use during pregnancy. No family history of congenital heart disease. His twin brother is in good health.   Past Medical History:  The patient was born at 37 weeks gestation  with a birth weight of 5lbs 6oz. He was discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) 5 days after birth for observation due to transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). A 2/6 systolic murmur was noted during his NICU stay and an echocardiogram was performed revealing a defect in the interventricular septum  diagnosed as a ventricular septal defect (VSD).  Since discharge  his mother reports he has been feeding well but tiring easily and sweating during feeds. He has been gaining weight slowly.  In office  his vitals are as follows: HR - 138 BPM  RR - 44 breaths per minute  BP - 85/46 mmHg  Temp - 98.7 F  and SpO2 - 92% on room air. Physical examination reveals a continuous  machinery-like heart murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border and mildly decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the lung bases suggestive of pulmonary congestion.  Differential Diagnosis:  Given the physical findings in addition to the prenatal  NICU  and post-discharge course  the primary concern is for congenital heart disease. The continuous murmur  postprandial sweating  and slow weight gain strongly suggest Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) in addition to the previously diagnosed VSD. Further work-up such as an echocardiogram is recommended. 
13,2,47,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial47,Patient Information: A 3-month-old Hispanic female infant presents at the clinic with her mother.   Chief Complaint: Poor feeding  increased irritability  and rapid breathing.  History: The mother states the child has been feeding poorly for the last 2 weeks and appears irritable more frequently. The baby has also been breathing rapidly and tires easily.   Family History: The mother had gestational diabetes during her pregnancy but otherwise no known family history of congenital heart disease.   Physical Exam: On examination  the baby appears pale and has slight cyanosis around her lips. On auscultation  a heart murmur is heard. The infant's pulse is 105 beats per minute and respiratory rate is 45 breaths per minute.  Assessment: The constellation of symptoms including poor feeding  irritability  rapid breathing  easy fatigue  and heart murmur suggest the presence of congenital heart disease. Further diagnostic tests are required to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the condition.
13,2,48,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial48,Patient Presentation:  A 3-month-old male infant is brought by his parents with concerns of feeding difficulties and inadequate weight gain. He was born full term without any complications and has had all scheduled well-child visits and immunizations up to this date.   The patient's birth weight was 3.2 kilograms. However  he has been displaying slow weight gain despite frequent breastfeeding and adequate wet/dirty diapers. His mother reports recent onset of sweating during feeds and tiring quickly. She also noticed an increasing rate of respirations and mild cyanosis during crying.  There is no history of recurrent respiratory infections. Family history is notable for the infant's older sister who had a ventricular septal defect diagnosed and surgically repaired early in her life. The patient’s parents are non-consanguineous and there is no history of illegal drug use during pregnancy.  Upon physical examination  the infant is active and alert  but appears underweight for his age. Chest auscultation reveals a systolic murmur. Pulse oximetry measurements show a mild decrease in oxygen saturation.  Considering the combination of slow weight gain  feeding difficulties  cardiac murmur  and family history of congenital heart disease  a clinical suspicion of a congenital heart defect is raised. A consult with a pediatric cardiologist is sought for further evaluation and management.
13,2,49,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial49,Patient Presentation:   A 6-month-old male infant named Jack is brought in by his parents to our general pediatric clinic. They notice that he appears to have problems while feeding  such as becoming excessively tired and sweaty with feeds. They also remark that he seems to be gaining weight at a slower pace compared to his older brother at the same age.   Demographics:   Jack is a 6-month-old male infant living in the suburban neighborhood. He was born full-term (39 weeks)  the second child to Caucasian parents  with a birth weight of 3.5 kilograms. He is currently being breastfed and is started on mushy semi-solid food along with breastfeeds. His immunizations are up to date as per his age.   Past Medical History:   Jack's antenatal and neonatal history was largely uneventful. His mother had regular antenatal care and no complications were reported during the pregnancy. He was delivered vaginally and had a normal Apgar score. There is no known family history of any cardiovascular disease  genetic disorders or unexpected early death. His growth and development were advancing adequately until the age of 5 months when his parents started noticing the current concerns.   Observation:   On examination  he was observed to be slightly cyanotic particularly after feeds. His other vitals were normal. On assessment of the cardiovascular system  a malformation-related murmur was detected  which raised suspicion for a potential congenital heart defect. Further general physical examination rendered no additional key features.   Based on the above presentation  further diagnostic investigations including an echocardiogram and other necessary tests will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis of congenital heart disease.
13,2,50,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial50,Patient Presentation:  A 12-year-old Hispanic male  accompanied by his parents  presents to the pediatric cardiology clinic reporting fatigue  palpitations  and difficulty keeping up with his peers during physical activities. These symptoms have been persistent for around six months  with an apparent increase in the last 2 months. The patient denies chest pain  syncope  or dyspnea. However  his parents have observed frequent cyanosis  particularly after physical activities. He was born full term without complications and immunizations are up-to-date according to his age.  The patient has had a past medical history significant for multiple hospital admissions in his early childhood due to recurrent lower respiratory tract infections and delayed growth milestones. He was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot but did not receive any surgical intervention during infancy due to the asymptomatic nature of his condition until recently. The family history is significant for his mother having a congenital heart defect  specifically a ventricular septal defect which was repaired during her childhood.  He was previously on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent bacterial endocarditis and folic acid supplements. No allergies have been noted. The patient is currently in the 7th grade  does well academically  and lives at home with his parents and younger sister. His immunizations are up to par for his age. He has no reported use of tobacco  alcohol  or illicit substances.
13,2,51,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial51,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 6-year-old Hispanic male brought in by his mother who reports he has difficulty engaging in physical play with peers  and has had multiple episodes of fainting. On further questioning  the mother reveals that the boy was diagnosed with a heart murmur during infancy.  Past Medical History:  Apart from congenital heart disease  boy has had numerous hospitalizations and visits to the cardiologist owing to frequent respiratory infections. Two years ago  he underwent cardiac catheterization to confirm and evaluate the extent of his defect  which revealed the presence of a ventricular septal defect.  The patient's family history is positive for cardiac disease  including an elder sister who also has congenital heart disease. No incidences of sudden cardiac death or other genetic disorders in the family. The patient’s immunizations are up-to-date  he has normal growth and development milestones  and had chickenpox at age 5. No history of any surgical procedures  allergy or current medications.
13,2,52,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial52,A four-month-old male infant born at 38 weeks with a birth weight of 3.3 kg was brought to the pediatric clinic. The parents complained that the baby seemed to have a poor feeding habit  excessive sweating  and a noticeable difficulty in breathing. According to the parents  the baby had sudden bouts of blue discoloration  especially around the lips after crying or feeding  episodes which had been increasing in frequency over the past month.   The child was a product of non-consanguineous parents and was delivered via a normal vaginal delivery. During prenatal check-ups  there were no reported instances of maternal drug or alcohol use  virul infections  or exposure to teratogens during pregnancy. There was no family history of congenital heart disease  but the mother suffered from gestational diabetes managed by dietary changes.  On physical exam  an audible heart murmur was noted upon auscultation. The infant's weight was below the 5th percentile for his age and sex  indicating failure to thrive.  No immediate postnatal problems were reported. The baby was exclusively breastfed and was vaccinated according to the immunization schedule. He had one previous hospitalization due to pneumonia at the age of 2 months and recovered with antibiotic treatment.   Given the baby's symptoms  physical findings  and history  it was suspected that he is suffering from a congenital heart disease  possibly Tetralogy of Fallot  and will need further diagnostic evaluation.
13,2,53,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial53,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a six-week-old male infant named Jacob  born to a 24-year-old primigravid mother at 36 weeks of gestation. His birth weight was 4.2kg  and he has been exclusively breastfed since then. The pregnancy was uneventful with no exposure to any illicit substances  infections  radiation or any medication  except for the prenatal vitamins prescribed by her obstetrician. He was well until three weeks of age when he started showing poor feeding and excessive sweating mostly while being fed. The mother further reported that Jacob has been becoming progressively pale and is breathing quicker than usual.   There is no significant family history of congenital abnormalities or early infant deaths on either side. Jacob had a normal Apgar score at birth  and initial neonatal screenings were also normal with no reported complications.   On examination  Jacob is found to be afebrile but tachypneic and tachycardic. There are no signs of any infections. He also appears mildly cyanotic  with pallor noted. Jacob’s weight is falling below the expected percentiles; it has decreased to 3.8 kg from his birthweight of 4.2 kg. On chest auscultation  a heart murmur was noted.   Considering Jacob's symptoms and the physical examination findings  a diagnosis of potential congenital heart disease is suspected  requiring further evaluation and potential referral to a pediatric cardiologist.   NB: This is only a presumptive diagnosis; further investigations are essential.
13,2,54,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial54,Patient Presentation:  Mr. J is a 14-year-old male who has been referred to our clinic expressing some complaints about progressive exercise intolerance  unexplained fatigue  and occasional shortness of breath  especially during physical effort.

13,2,58,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial58,Patient Information: A female infant  3-month-old  Caucasian  from suburban Midwestern United States.  Chief Complaint: Multiple episodes of poor feeding and excessive sweating during the last week.   History of Present Illness: The mother noticed the baby being fussier during feedings  which are getting prolonged and the child is sweating profusely during these times. Also noticed difficulty in breathing after feeding and less activity than usual.   Past Medical History: Delivered at full-term with a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery  birth weight of 7 lb. The pregnancy was uncomplicated  with no history of maternal kidney disease  diabetes  or drug abuse. No neonatal complications and her developmental milestones have been normal up to this point.  Family History: The mother is a 28-year-old teacher  and the father is a 30-year-old accountant  both are healthy non-smokers. There is a family history of heart disease on the father's side with paternal grandfather having an early heart attack at 45.  Social History: The patient lives with both parents and a 5-year-old sibling. The school-going sibling is up-to-date with immunizations. There is no history of international travel  sick contacts  or animal exposures.  Relevant Findings: Upon examination  the baby was noted to have subcostal and intercostal retractions  with a respiratory rate of 62/min. She has a pulse rate of 170/min and her oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Heart auscultation revealed a soft systolic murmur. Her weight gain has slowed down compared to the previous well-child visits.   This clinical scenario is suggestive of a possible cardiac problem  likely a congenital heart disease  which needs further diagnostic evaluation.
13,2,59,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial59,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 4-month-old male infant brought in by his parents due to poor feeding habits and excessive sweating. The parents describe a history of frequent respiratory infections since birth and say that their baby seems to tire easily and regularly falls asleep during feeding. They also report noticing that their baby often has blue-tinged skin during feeding and crying bouts.  The birth history was uneventful; the baby was born full term with a birth weight of 3.5 kg. However  he is not gaining weight as expected for his age. No relevant family history of heart disease or other congenital anomalies was reported.   On examination  the baby appeared to be in mild distress with visible signs of grunting while breathing. Examination further revealed a palpable heart murmur and significantly enlarged liver.   The early onset of symptoms  the presence of a heart murmur  and the baby's failure to thrive suggest a complex form of congenital heart disease. Further cardiac evaluation  diagnosis  and treatment plan will need to include pediatric cardiology specialist consultation  echocardiography  and possibly cardiothoracic surgery if a severe cardiac defect is confirmed.
13,2,60,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial60,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 3-day-old male neonate brought to the clinic by his mother for a well-baby check-up.

They also bring to attention that she has been showing signs of shortness of breath and she tires very easily while bottle-feeding  needing frequent pauses. In addition  Maya's growth and weight gain seem slower than other children of her age.   Past Medical History:  Maya was delivered at term through normal vaginal delivery. She has had repeated chest infections since birth and has needed hospital admission on a few occasions. There are no known drug allergies. Maya has received all her immunizations according to her age.  On examination:  Maya is a small child for her age  weighing below the 5th percentile. Physical examination revealed a bluish tinge to her skin and lips (cyanosis). There were no obvious dysmorphic features. Cardiovascular examination revealed a loud harsh systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border.  The preliminary differential diagnosis includes conditions that cause cyanotic congenital heart disease such as Tetralogy of Fallot and Transposition of Great Arteries. She is referred for an echocardiogram for accurate diagnosis and surgical correction if required. 
13,2,62,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial62,Patient Presentation: A 6-month-old Hispanic male infant is brought in by his mother  who reports he has been feeding poorly  growing slowly  and experiencing repeated respiratory infections. Mother also reports that the baby often seems to have rapid  labored breathing and appears blue-toned around his lips and under his fingernails  particularly after feeding or crying. All symptoms have been present since birth.  The mother reports a full-term pregnancy with no complications. This is her first child. The infant received appropriate prenatal care  but no fetal anomalies were identified. Family history includes a maternal uncle with an unspecified form of congenital heart disease.  The patient has a birth weight of 2.9 kg  but now  at 6 months old  he weighs 4.1 kg  well below the average for his age. Upon auscultation  a heart murmur is present. Other physical exam findings include mild tachypnea and slight cyanosis of the lips and nail beds.   Considering the history and physical examination  a suspicion of congenital heart disease is raised  particularly Tetralogy of Fallot or other cyanotic heart disorder. Further diagnostic imaging and confirmatory tests are required to specify the defect and guide the treatment plan. 
13,2,63,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial63,Patient Presentation: A 3-month old African American male infant is brought to the pediatric outpatient clinic by his mother who reports that he consistently has rapid and heavy breathing while feeding  and appears to be gaining less weight than expected for his age. The mother also states the baby's lips and skin occasionally turn bluish  especially during crying.   Demographics: The patient lives with his biological parents and a 3-year-old sibling in an urban environment. Both parents are non-smokers. The family has no known pet or environmental allergies.   Past Medical History: The patient was born full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery with no complications. Birth weight was 3.3 kg. Prenatal screenings were normal with adequate prenatal care. There were no known illnesses or hospitalizations. Vaccinations are up-to-date and developmental milestones are age appropriate. The patient's family history is significant for heart diseases; his paternal grandfather having had a myocardial infarction at the age of 50. There is no family history of congenital heart disease or sudden cardiac deaths.   Physical Examination: The infant is found to be in mild respiratory distress with grunting. He presents with a heart rate of 145 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 60 breaths per minute with subcostal and intercostal retractions  oxygen saturation of 88% on room air  and weighing 4.9 kg (<3rd percentile). Trauma  fractures  and wounds are absent. Skin appears slightly cyanotic. Cardiac auscultation reveals a loud P2 and a harsh Grade 3/6 pansystolic murmur best heard in the left lower sternal border. The liver is palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin.  A subsequent echocardiography confirms the diagnosis of a large ventricular septal defect with a left-to-right shunt  establishing a case of congenital heart disease in the patient. Immediate consultations with pediatric cardiology for a comprehensive care plan  including surgical intervention  are being made. 
13,2,64,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial64,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 3-month-old male infant of Hispanic descent  brought in by his parents due to concerns of feeding difficulties and breathing problems. They reported that their infant feeds less than usual and tires quickly during meals. They also observed that he breathes rapidly  even at rest. Additionally  he has not been gaining weight at the expected rate. No history of fever  cough  or seizures.  Past Medical History:  The infant was born at term and had a normal vaginal delivery with no complications during pregnancy. There are no known allergies or medications. The parents reported that around one month of age  they noticed that he has a bluish color around his lips  particularly when he cries. This symptom has been progressive worsening.  Family History:  No known family history of congenital heart disease or genetic disorders. Both parents are healthy  and the patient has a 2-year-old sister with no known health conditions.
13,2,65,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial65,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 5-month-old Caucasian female infant brought to the clinic by her parents for a routine check-up. She was born full term  with a birth weight of 3.5 kg and reported no significant problems during pregnancy. Her mother reported a family history of congenicardital disease. Vaccination is up-to-date. The patient lives with both parents and has an older brother with no health issues. No tobacco  alcohol  or illicit drug exposure is reported.   Despite good dietary intake  the child has poor weight gain  being below the 10th percentile for age. The parents report physical activity limitation with signs of excessive sweating and fatigue during feeding. They have also noticed an unusual increase in her breathing rate  compared with other infants and noticed occasional pale bluish skin color.  The physical examination yielded a delayed growth pattern and minor developmental delays. Soft systolic murmur was heard upon cardiovascular examination and the liver was palpable  suggesting hepatomegaly. On chest inspection and palpation  a non-visible  nonpalpable  non-displaced apical pulse was found. A pulse oximetry reading indicated an abnormal oxygen saturation level slightly below normal.  In her past medical history  it was found that she was hospitalized for a month in the neonatal period with symptoms of jaundice and poor feeding. Consequently  the repeat assessments and hospitalization indicate further exploration for structural heart anomaly. This physical examination and history findings strongly suggest the presence of a congenital heart defect in this infant.
13,2,66,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial66,Patient Information:   9-month-old male infant  Hispanic.  Chief Complaint:   Difficulty in feeding  rapid breathing and fatigue from play. Mom also reports that the baby's skin turns blue after crying or during feeding.  Present Illness History:  Parents noticed the baby having trouble feeding and getting tired easily since birth. Symptoms have been gradually worsening. They have noted poor weight gain over time. No history of fever or cough.  Past Medical History:  The patient was born at term with a normal vaginal delivery. There were no complications during pregnancy. Mother denies pre-natal drug or alcohol use. No history of congenital diseases in the family. Full childhood immunizations. No previous hospitalizations or surgeries.  Physical Examination:  Weight below 5th percentile for age. Mildly distressed with moderate tachypnea. Cyanosis noted on lips and nail beds. Cardiac auscultation revealed a loud systolic murmur. Other systems were within normal limits.  Preliminary Diagnosis:  Based on the early presentation  failure to thrive  typical clinical symptoms and physical examination findings  a preliminary diagnosis of congenital heart disease is considered.    Diagnosis is to be confirmed with further investigations like chest X-ray  EKG  and echocardiogram which could help confirm the specific type of congenital heart disease.  Treatment Plan:  The patient will likely need a referral to pediatric cardiology for further management  which may include medications  and invasive procedures or surgery depending on the type of heart defect. Congenital heart disease might require life-long follow up with a cardiologist.
13,2,67,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial67,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 3-month-old Caucasian male infant brought in by his mother for recurrent episodes of difficulty in feeding  unusual irritability  and increased sweating especially during feeding. She also notes the cyanotic color - a bluish tinge observed on the baby's lips and fingernails especially when crying. The mother has also noticed poor weight gain since birth.   Past medical history suggests that the baby was born full-term via normal spontaneous delivery  with no complications reported during pregnancy or delivery. There is no significant family history of any congenital heart disease  but there is a paternal history of early onset coronary artery disease.   The patient's immunizations are up to date  but mother reports he has been mostly kept indoors due to persisting flu-like symptoms over the last 2 weeks. Also  there is no known drug allergy history.  Physical examination findings suggest difficulty in breathing and the baby's heart sounds are abnormal with murmurs. The infant’s measurements  such as weight  length  and head circumference  are also below the expected percentile ranges as per his age.   Upon review with these symptoms and clinical findings  it is suspected that the child may be suffering from a form of congenital heart disease. Further diagnostic evaluation is deemed necessary for confirmation.
13,2,68,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial68,Patient Profile Name: Baby John Doe Age: 4 months old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Residency: Urban  Chief Complaint The patient's mother reports that her son does not seem to be gaining weight  tires easily and often sweats while feeding. Furthermore  he has been having difficulty breathing.  Past Medical History Baby John was born full term without complications via vaginal birth to a healthy 32-year-old mother. His birth weight was 8 pounds and 4 ounces (3.74 kg). The mother had no infections or complications during her pregnancy. All immunizations are up to date.  Family History There is no known history of congenital heart diseases in the family. The mother doesn’t smoke  consume alcohol  or use illegal drugs.   Physical Examination  Upon inspection  there appears to be a bluish tinge to the skin  lips and nails (cyanosis) and the baby seems somewhat lethargic. Rapid  shallow respirations are noted along with a faster than usual heart rate. His chest is hyper-dynamic upon palpation with a noticeable thrill. Upon auscultation  a heart murmur is detected.  Conclusion  The baby’s symptoms  in association with his physical examination findings  suggest a possible congenital heart defect. This would require immediate attention and further diagnostic testing  likely an echocardiogram  to confirm the presence of a structural heart abnormality. The differential diagnosis includes potentially life-threatening conditions such as Tetralogy of Fallot  Transposition of the Great Arteries  Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome  or a single ventricle defect. The patient needs immediate attention from a pediatric cardiology team for full work-up and treatment planning.
13,2,69,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial69,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a two-month-old  male infant  Caucasian  presented with his mother to the pediatric outpatient department. He is the first child of non-consanguineous parents with no family history of genetic diseases or congenital heart defects.   History of Present Illness:  The mother reports that the infant has been experiencing difficulties when feeding  often becoming breathless and sweaty. She has also noted frequent episodes of bluish discoloration around the infant's lips and fingertips. Upon further inquiry  the mother reports that the symptoms have been present since the child was two weeks old and have been gradually worsening. She denies any recent ill contacts  fever  cough  or diarrhea. The birth history was unremarkable  full-term normal vaginal delivery with no complications during pregnancy.  Relevant Past Medical History:  The baby received routine vaccinations according to his age with no evident reactions. There's no history of past hospitalization or chronic illness in the baby. His growth parameters have been lagging behind for his age  particularly weight gain due to feeding difficulties.  Family History:  There's no family history of early heart disease  sudden death  or congenital diseases. Both parents are healthy and do not have any chronic illnesses. There is no history of drug or alcohol abuse in the family.
13,2,70,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial70,Patient Information: A 10-month-old Hispanic female infant presented to the pediatric clinic.  Chief Complaint: Parents report difficulty in feeding  along with increased irritability and excessive sweating during feeding times. They also noticed a weight gain issue over the last couple of visits to the pediatrician's office.   History of Present Illness: Over the past two months  the infant has been feeding less than usual and often appears lethargic after feedings. She also experiences shortness of breath  rapid breathing  and excessive sweating  particularly during feedings. These symptoms have gradually become more pronounced.   Past Medical History: She was born full-term via normal vaginal delivery with no complications during the pregnancy or childbirth reported. However  the baby failed the pulse oximetry screening performed at birth.   Social History: Both parents are non-smokers and deny drug use. There's no family history of congenital heart disease or early cardiac death.   Prior Medication: None.  Vitals: Temperature 98.6 F  Heart rate 155/min  Respiratory rate 40/min  Oxygen saturation 88% on room air.  Physical Exam: When visualized  the infant appeared pale and lethargic. On auscultation  a heart murmur was detected  consistent with some forms of congenital heart disease. However  the infant's lungs were clear  and the rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Based on the presentation  this case is suggestive of a potential congenital heart disease due to the persistent symptoms and presence of heart murmur. 
13,2,71,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial71,Patient Presentation:  Patient is a 6-month-old Caucasian male infant brought in by his parents. He was born at full term with no complications during pregnancy or birth. His parents have noticed the baby is not gaining weight adequately and seems more breathless during feeding compared to their two  older healthy children. No significant family history suggestive of any inherited disorders.   On examination  the baby appears slightly underweight for his age and cyanotic  particularly around the lips and extremities. He has a visible  forceful apical impulse and a parasternal heave. On auscultation  a harsh pan systolic murmur heard at the left lower sternal edge.  Developmentally  the baby has been lagging behind  with the infant not demonstrating expected milestones such as rolling over.  His immunizations are up-to-date except for a delay in his 6-month vaccines due to a common cold.  Upon further diagnostic workup  a chest X-ray reveals a boot-shaped heart  suggestive of Tetralogy of Fallot  a common form of congenital heart disease. His blood oxygen levels also fall below the normal range on pulse oximetry. Overall  the baby is stable  however  he will be requiring a surgery for correction of this defect.
13,2,72,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial72,Patient Presentation:  A 2-year-old Hispanic male child is presented by his parents to the Pediatric department. They express concerns about his slow growth and development compared to his peers with mention of his frequently observed bluish color around the mouth especially when he cries. The child is also reported to get tired easily and has had recurrent respiratory infections since birth.  Past Medical History:  The mother reports a pregnancy that was overall healthy but confesses to a lack of prenatal care. Exceptionally  the child was born full term via normal vaginal delivery and had no complications or hospitalizations post-delivery.  Family history is significant for early heart disease in the father. The parents deny any known familial genetic diseases or congenital abnormalities. There is no history of parental consanguinity. The mother reports no use of alcohol  tobacco  or illicit drugs during pregnancy.  The child is up-to-date with all immunizations per the recommended schedule. There is a history of delayed attainment of pediatric developmental milestones with the child only just beginning to walk and talk.   On examination  the child appears smaller and weighs less compared to children of the same age. The presence of a distinct heart murmur is noted  and upon inspecting the oral mucosa  a bluish discoloration (cyanosis) is observed.  These symptoms and findings suggest a congenital heart disease possibly Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) or another cyanotic congenital heart condition which needs further diagnostics  including echocardiography and cardiac catheterization  for confirmation and treatment planning.
13,2,73,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial73,"Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 3-month old Asian female infant presented by her parents to the pediatric clinic. Parents report that their infant has experienced feeding difficulties  rapid breathing  and a lack of normal weight gain since birth. The parents also note she tires easily  especially during feedings. There have been no episodes of cyanosis or any known illnesses.   She was born full-term via normal vaginal delivery at a local hospital without any reported complications. Her birth weight was within normal range. Since then  she has not met the expected weight milestones for her age group. Family medical history is significant for a paternal cousin having a """"heart problem"""" at birth but the parents are unsure of the specifics.  On examination  she appears fatigued and mildly dyspneic. A cardiac examination reveals a soft grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.  Given her symptoms of poor weight gain  feeding difficulties and a heart murmur  a diagnosis of congenital heart disease is suspected. Further diagnostic work-up including an echocardiogram and consultation with pediatric cardiology will be requested."
13,2,74,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial74,"Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 4-year-old African American male  who presented to the pediatric clinic with chief complaints of poor weight gain  increased work of breathing  and frequent respiratory infections  particularly a case of pneumonia last month. These symptoms have been persistently noticed by the mother since the child was about 6 months old.  Past Medical History:   The patient was born at full term with no immediate complications  his mother reported no significant issues during pregnancy and no history of smoking  drug  or alcohol use. Well-child check-ups and all immunizations are up-to-date. However  signs of failure to thrive were uncovered  as his weight has consistently been below the 5th percentile since his 6-month visit.  Family History:  Multigenerational genetic history revealed the mother has two distant cousins with unspecified """"heart problems"""". The father has hypertension  but no known family history of heart disease.  Assessment:   Cyanosis of lips and nail beds were observed during physical examination. A grade 4/6 blowing holosystolic murmur was detected upon auscultation of the heart. These clinical features and history are suggestive of possible congenital heart disease and further diagnostic investigations are warranted."
13,2,75,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial75,Patient Presentation: The patient is a 2-month-old male infant  of Asian descent  born at full-term with a birth weight of 3.2kg. He was referred to the pediatric department of our hospital by his primary care physician due to persistent cyanosis and trouble feeding. His parents report an increasing frequency of episodes where he becomes short of breath  especially during feeding  and his cry has been weaker than usual.  The baby has been feeding less since these episodes began and as a result  he's underweight for his age  weighing only 3.9 kg at 2 months old. His parents also noticed the baby’s lips and skin appear bluish  especially after his feeding episodes. The baby is the first child in the family  and there were no complications reported during the prenatal and birth period.   His family has no history of heart diseases or other congenital problems. He has not been hospitalized before and no medications or allergies are reported.  On physical examination  the baby has evident cyanosis  especially around the lips and limbs. There is an audible heart murmur distinguished during auscultation. Given these symptoms  a suspicion of congenital cyanotic heart disease is noted  possibly tetralogy of Fallot  considering the cyanosis  feeding problems  and audible murmur. Further diagnostic testing  including an echocardiogram  is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
13,2,76,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial76,Patient Presentation:  A five-week-old Caucasian male infant  named James  presented in our pediatric clinic accompanied by his parents. James's parents stated that he has been having feeding difficulties and appears fatigued after every feed  showing signs of rapid breathing and profuse sweating. They also noted that the baby’s skin was often on the pale or bluish side. James was born full-term via NSVD with no immediate neonatal issues. There were no known maternal infections or drug use during pregnancy. James's birth weight was 3.3 kg.  The family history is pertinent for a paternal uncle who had a congenital heart defect. James's parents are asymptomatic and have no history of genetic disease. The familial congenital heart disease pattern suggests a potential genetic component.   James's growth parameters are below the 5th percentile for his age. Upon physical examination  he was gruntling with retraction suggesting respiratory distress. Heart examination revealed a grade III/VI pansystolic murmur in the left lower sternal border. James was displaying symptoms of failure to thrive and cyanosis  which may be indicative of a congenital heart condition.
13,2,77,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial77,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 3-month-old male infant named Lucas Anderson  who comes to the pediatric clinic accompanied by his parents. His parents report that Lucas has been experiencing problems with feeding and seems to be sweating a lot  especially during feeds. They also note that he seems to tire easily  has difficulty gaining weight  and has a noticeable blue tinge around his lips and fingernails. His family has no known genetic conditions but his paternal aunt had a child with a heart condition.  Past Medical History:   Lucas was born full-term via natural vaginal delivery with no significant antenatal or delivery issues. However  he was small for his gestational age. His neonatal period was uneventful. His immunizations are up to date and he has no known allergies.   On examination  the pediatrician notes a heart murmur alongside signs of poor weight gain and mild cyanosis – both potential symptoms of a heart issue. Given Lucas's symptoms and the family history  the pediatrician refers him to a pediatric cardiologist for further investigation  suspecting congenital heart disease.
13,2,78,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial78,Patient Presentation:  A 6-month-old female infant is brought in by her parents who are concerned about her slower than normal physical development and occasional rapid breathing. The patient's mother reported that since birth  the child seems to tire easily during feeding  sweats more than her siblings did as infants  and seems to have a bluish color especially on her lips and fingers.  Demographic Details:  The patient is an American-origin infant  born full-term via normal vaginal delivery after an overall unremarkable pregnancy. She has three older siblings aged 3  5  and 7  none of which have any congenital abnormalities or serious medical illnesses. Both parents are healthy with no known genetic disorders. The father is a 31-year-old high school teacher  and the mother is a 29-year-old homemaker. They live in a suburban neighborhood.  Medical History: The infant's neonatal period was characterized by mild cyanosis and tachypnea but no other complications. The mother reports that the infant received all the recommended vaccinations without any adverse events. She had been treated twice over the past three months for repeat chest infections indicated by cough  rapid breathing  and decreased appetite but had responded well to antibiotics. No surgeries or hospitalizations have been reported or required.   The infant has not been diagnosed with any condition  suspected for Down syndrome  or congenital heart diseases in the past and there has been no history of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the family. The parents are familiar with the signs of congenital heart defects as the father's brother had a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) as an infant but lived a healthy life after corrective surgery. This history  along with the child's recurring symptoms  prompts the need for further investigation into potential congenital heart disease.
13,2,79,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial79,Patient Presentation:  The patient is an 8-month-old female infant born at term to a 28-year-old gravida 1  para 1 mother. Mother had no known medical illness during pregnancy  and birth was uncomplicated. Mother's prenatal laboratory tests were unremarkable  and she states that she did not use any drugs or alcohol during her pregnancy. The family history is significant only for type 2 diabetes in the maternal grandmother.  The patient was brought to clinic due to the mother's concern about the baby's feeding problems. She reports that the baby becomes fatigued and sweats profusely during feeds  only consumes small volumes  and has had poor weight gain. She also noted the baby's lips and nails turn bluish at times.  Detailed physical examination of the baby reveals she weighs 5.5 kg (5th percentile)  a grade 3/6 systolic ejection holosystolic murmur heard best at left sternal border  hepatomegaly  poor peripheral pulses  and mild cyanosis in lips and fingers. Her oxygen saturation is 89% in room air.  The patient's immunizations are up to date per the standard vaccination schedule. She has no known allergies  and she is not on any medications. She has no previous known medical or surgical history. The parents do not smoke  and there are no pets or siblings at home. The patient has not travelled recently  and she is not attending daycare.  Given the patient's symptoms and clinical findings  a more detailed cardiac investigation is suggested to look for possible congenital heart disease. Studies should include an EKG  echocardiogram  and chest X-ray. Further management will be guided by these results.
13,2,80,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial80,Patient Information: A two-month-old Caucasian male infant  presented by his mother.  Chief Complaint: Rapid breathing and poor feeding.  History of Present Illness: The infant has reportedly been experiencing rapid breathing for a week and has been feeding inadequately  which has led to weight loss. The mother reports no fever  cough  or other symptoms of illness.   Past Medical History: The mother disclosed a family history of congenital heart disease on the father's side. The pregnancy was uneventful  and the infant was born via normal vaginal delivery at term. Routine newborn screening was normal. The patient has not been on any medications. There have been no previous hospitalizations or surgeries.  Relevant Family History: The father was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect as a child but underwent successful corrective surgery without any complications.  Social History: The infant is primarily breastfed with occasional supplementing with formula milk. Lives at home with his mother  father  and 3-year old sibling. His immunizations are up-to-date according to his age.  Physical Examination: The infant appears small for his age. His heart rate is 140 beats/min  and respiratory rate is 60 breaths/min  both of which are slightly elevated. The lung examination is normal with no crackles. The heart murmur is identified upon auscultation. Clubbing is not evident in the fingers and toes. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.  Assessment: The symptoms and initial physical examination are suggestive of possible congenital heart disease that needs to be confirmed by further diagnostic tools such as an echocardiogram.   
13,2,81,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial81,"Patient Presentation: The patient is a 2-year-old female named Emma who presents to the pediatric cardiology clinic with her mother. They are of Hispanic origin and live in a small apartment in an urban area. Emma is the only child and is currently attending preschool. Her mother reports that Emma often seems to tire more easily than her peers and occasionally exhibits a blue tint around her lips when she is playing.  Past Medical History: Emma was born full term without any complications. However  she was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot at her 6-month check-up after her pediatrician heard a heart murmur during a routine examination. She also had a brief hospitalization at 8 months old for a """"TET spell"""" – a sudden  severe cyanotic episode – which was managed conservatively. She has not required any surgical intervention up to this point. Vaccination is up to date. There are no known allergies.  Family History: Emma's mother has a history of mildly elevated blood pressure. No other family members have been diagnosed with any congenital heart issues  nor have there been any sudden deaths in the family.  Social History: Emma's parents are non-smokers  and there is no history of substance abuse in the family. Her diet is typical for a toddler  and her mother tries to enforce regular meals with an emphasis on fruits and vegetables. She is meeting all her developmental milestones way before the suggested timeline  and is reportedly a quick learner and very curious for her age."
13,2,82,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial82,Patient Presentation:  A 2-year-old Hispanic female  Sophia  presents to the pediatric clinic with her mother. She was born at full term with no immediate complications  but her growth and development have been slightly lagging compared to other infants of her age. The mother mentions that Sophia has poor feeding  difficulty gaining weight  and gets excessively tired during physical activities. She also reports that Sophia often experiences episodes of rapid breathing and has bluish skin during these episodes.   Past medical history is significant for recurrent respiratory infections since infancy. Sophia's mother reports no known drug allergies and there is no family history of congenital heart diseases or any other genetic disorders. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She was noticed to have a heart murmur during her infancy  but it was not followed up due to the family's limited access to healthcare services.   A high index of suspicion for Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is raised due to the child's breathing difficulties  inadequate growth  and history of a detected heart murmur. Further diagnostic evaluations will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. She will require a complete cardiac examination and echocardiography  with an urgent referral to Pediatric Cardiology vital for confirmatory diagnosis and further management.
13,2,83,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial83,Patient Information: A 3-month-old female  African-American infant  brought in by her parents.  Chief Complaint: Difficulty in feeding  rapid breathing  and failure to gain weight.  History of Present Illness: The parents report that the child seems to tire easily during feedings and often becomes sweaty and out of breath. She has not been gaining weight appropriately for her age. Additionally  they have noticed a bluish discoloration around her lips and extremities  particularly when she cries.  Medications: None.  Allergies: No known allergies.  Family History: The mother reported a family history of congenital heart disease on the father's side. The father underwent repair for a ventricular septal defect in childhood.   Past Medical History: The child was full term with an unremarkable perinatal course. She has had routine pediatric care with regular immunizations. No previous hospitalizations or surgeries.  Review of Systems: -General: Decreased activity level  failure to thrive. -Cardiovascular: Fast breathing  easy fatigability. -Respiratory: Occasional coughing and wheezing  but no fever or known infections. -Musculoskeletal: Normal movement. -Neurological: Normal developmental milestones for age  barring the weight gain issue. -Gastrointestinal: Difficulty in feeding  but no vomitings or constipation.   Physical Examination: On examination  she was found to have bluish discoloration around her lips and on the tips of her fingers and toes. Heart sounds revealed a murmur. Her pulses were slightly weaker than normal  and she had mild hepatomegaly.  Summary: This is a 3-month-old female child with signs and symptoms suggestive of cyanotic congenital heart disease. The history of difficulty in feeding  failure to gain weight  easy fatigability  cyanosis  tachypnea  and a family history of heart disease strongly correlates with a possible congenital heart defect  which needs to be further evaluated by a pediatric cardiologist.
13,2,84,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial84,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 3-month old male infant who was brought into the clinic by his parents for concerns over poor feedings and increasingly noticeable bluish discoloration on the lips and skin  especially during crying or feeding. He was born full-term through normal vaginal delivery  however  prenatal screening was not performed. The growth and development have been generally within expectations  but his mother reports feeding has always been difficult and has lately worsened with the baby tiring quicker than usual and refusing to breastfeed.  The family history is significant for congenital heart disease  as the paternal grandfather has a history of a congenital heart defect. Other medical history is unremarkable. The infant has had all relevant vaccinations and shows no sign of current infectious illness. No allergies have been reported. There is no history of domestic tobacco smoke or drug exposure.  Upon physical examination  it was noted that the baby demonstrated signs of cyanosis around the mouth and fingers. There are audible heart murmurs. The baby's heart rate was elevated at rest. The baby also has mild subcostal and intercostal retractions  potentially indicating difficulties in breathing.   Weight gain is below the expected range for his age  reflecting potential failure to thrive due to increased caloric expenditure or decreased feeding – both possible symptoms of congenital heart disease. The remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable. The patient was referred to a pediatric cardiologist for an echocardiogram and further evaluation.
13,2,85,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial85,"Patient Presentation:  A 6-month-old female infant  Emily  was brought into the pediatric clinic by her parents  of Hispanic origin  with a concern of feeding difficulties and repeated respiratory infections. Emily is the first child to young parents with no consanguinity.   Emily's birth was full-term via normal vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 3 kg. However  she failed to exhibit normal weight gain  with a current weight measuring below the 15th percentile for her age group. The parents also noted that Emily often becomes short of breath and sweaty during feedings  and she has persistent tachypnea and fatigue.  Emily's medical history reveals two hospitalizations due to pneumonia in the past three months. Family history is notable for a maternal grandfather who died of a """"heart problem"""" in his 40s  although the exact nature of this heart condition is unknown.   Emily was fully immunized according to her age  and her developmental milestones  though slightly delayed  were within acceptable range considering potential nutritional deficits and chronic illness.  On physical examination  the infant appears small for her age  presents a mild perioral cyanosis  and demonstrates subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest auscultation reveals a loud holosystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border with wide radiation. There was no organomegaly noticed on abdominal palpation.   The constellation of symptoms suggested a serious underlying condition  prompting further evaluation for potential congenital heart disease."
13,2,86,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial86,Patient Presentation:   The patient is a 6-month-old Caucasian female  accompanied by her parents. She was born after a full-term pregnancy without any complications during the delivery. However  ever since her birth  her parents have noticed certain unusual symptoms like rapid breathing  poor feeding  and difficulty gaining weight. They also mentioned episodes where she seemed to turn bluish especially around the mouth and hands while crying. There is no known family history of congenital heart disease or other genetic conditions.   Over the past month  they have noticed an increase in episodes of breathlessness and an inability to feed for more than a few minutes at a time prior to tiring. With these growing concerns  they decided to seek medical attention. The baby has been fully immunized as per the pediatric vaccination schedule and there have been no hospitalizations in the past.   The baby was breastfed until the age of 3 months then switched to formula feed which she tolerates well. The baby's other development milestones seem to be age-appropriate although there is a notable lag in her weight gain. There is no known drug or food allergy.   Consequently  a cardiac examination was conducted which revealed a murmur on auscultation  prompting the suspicion of a congenital heart defect that needs to be further investigated with diagnostic testing.
13,2,87,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial87,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a six-month-old Caucasian female infant named Emily who presented to the pediatric clinic accompanied by her parents. Her parents report that Emily often seems to tire easily  especially during feedings  and that she was recently diagnosed with failure to thrive at her routine pediatric check-up due to inadequate weight gain for her age and gender. Additionally  her pharynx was noticeably cyanotic during physical examination.   Emily was a full-term baby with a birth weight of 3.2 kilograms. According to the parents  she was fairly active and ate well during the first few months of life  but lately  she tires quickly  breathes rapidly  and sweats much more than her parents expect for an infant. They also note that she has more frequent episodes of illness compared to their older child at this age.  On physical examination  Emily displayed noticeable cyanosis and appeared to be breathing rapidly. Heart sounds were irregular on auscultation and a heart murmur was identified. Furthermore  clubbing was observed in her fingers and toes  suggesting long-standing hypoxia.   Relevant Past Medical History:  Emily had a recent hospital admission due to bronchiolitis  which was unusual for her age. She continues to be followed by a pediatrician for routine check-ups.   The family history is significant in revealing that the patient's paternal grandmother had an unspecified heart disease. The rest of the family history  including that for the parents and sibling  is noncontributory. Emily is up to date with the recommended immunizations for her age and there have been no reported allergies to medicines or food.
13,2,88,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial88,Patient Information: Baby girl  M.N.  3 months old  white  Chief Complaint: Cyanosis  difficulty feeding  and slow weight gain  History of Present Illness: The baby girl M.N. was born full term via normal delivery with no immediate postnatal complications. She has a history of poor feeding and frequent episodes of cyanosis  especially during feeding and crying  noticed since birth. The child has consistently gained less weight compared to other children of her age.   Past Medical History: The child has no previous medical history apart from a heart murmur detected during the newborn screening.  Family History:  Mother is 28 years old  with no significant medical condition. Father is 30 years old  diagnosed with congenital heart disease.  Physical Exam:  Physical examination shows central cyanosis which is more pronounced during crying. There is a grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. Fingertip clubbing is also observed.  With the child's symptoms  physical signs  family history of a genetic condition (paternal congenital heart disease)  and heart murmur noticed during newborn screening  the most likely diagnosis to explore is a cyanotic congenital heart disease. Further diagnostic investigations such as echocardiograms are needed for definitive diagnosis and to guide treatment planning.
13,2,89,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial89,Patient Presentation:  A 3-month-old African American male infant is brought into the pediatric clinic by his mother. She reports symptoms of rapid breathing  difficulty feeding  and noticed that her child appears bluer around the lips and tongue  especially after crying.  Past Medical History:  The newborn was delivered at term  weighing 6 lbs. 2 oz. He had normal APGAR scores  and initial physical examination was unrevealing. His mother's prenatal course was uneventful; however  she did not take prenatal vitamins consistently nor did she undergo screening for fetal anomalies due to lack of insurance. She does not smoke  drink  or use drugs. Family history revealed the infant's paternal uncle had a “hole in his heart” as a child  which required surgical correction. Vaccinations schedule has been followed up to date.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the infant is alert but appears distressed due to work of breathing. He has a bluish discolouration around the mouth. His weight is below the 5th percentile for age. Cardiac examination reveals a hyperactive precordium  palpable thrill  and a grade 4/6 pansystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. Lung examination reveals fine crackles bilaterally indicative of congestion. Femoral pulses are weak.  Impression:  The patient's signs and symptoms suggest a congenital heart disease (CHD)  possibly a large ventricular septal defect given the family history  audible murmur and cyanosis. The failure to thrive and feeding difficulties exhibited by the infant are also commonly associated with CHD. Further diagnostic workup  possibly including an echocardiogram  EKG  and chest radiographs are needed for a definitive diagnosis.

Regarding her son's birth and developmental history  she confirms that he was born at full term without complications. However  she indicates that she has noticed a bluish tint to her son's skin  particularly around the lips and nail beds  which is more visible when he is physically active or stressed.  The patient’s medical history is significant for frequent respiratory infections  delayed growth  episodes of unexplained and profuse sweating  especially during feeding time. No history of heart disease or genetic abnormalities in the family was acknowledged. However  prenatal history indicated mother smoked cigarettes during pregnancy  but no alcohol or illicit drug use was reported.   On examination  he is noted to have a mild delay featuring ejection systolic murmur. An ultrasound of his heart was performed  which revealed ventricular septal defect. Patient has no known allergies and he is not currently on any medications.  Diagnosis: Congenital heart disease is suspected  specifically Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)  based on the mother's description of symptoms  observation of cyanosis  and abnormal findings on physical and ultrasonic examination. Further diagnostic assessments  such as echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization  are scheduled to confirm the diagnosis and plan necessary intervention.
13,2,93,diagnosis13-prompt2-trial93,Patient Presentation:   Samantha  a 5-day-old Caucasian female  was brought into the pediatric cardiology clinic by her parents today. They reported their daughter was becoming breathless during feeding  appearing to tire easily  and displaying a bluish tint around her lips and fingertips.   Birth weight and length were normal at 3.5 kg and 50cm respectively. Her mother had regular prenatal visits and received adequate prenatal care. The pregnancy and delivery were uneventful with no history of maternal drug abuse  infections or medication during pregnancy. Samantha is exclusively breastfed and has lost 10% of her birth weight since delivery.  None of the family members have a history of congenital heart disease. Her examination revealed a heart rate of 180/minute  respiratory rate of 50/minute  blood pressure of 60/30 mmHg in all four limbs. Oxygen saturation was maintained at 100% in room air. On auscultation  a loud P2 with a soft systolic murmur was heard.

13,3,4,diagnosis13-prompt3-trial4,Title: Congenital Heart Disease in a 5-year-old Male Patient  Slide 1: Introduction The case involves a 5-year-old male patient named Ethan who is suffering from congenital heart disease (CHD). He comes from a non-smoking household and has a twin sister who doesn't show any signs of CHD.  Slide 2: Demographics Ethan belongs to a Caucasian ethnicity  and resides in a suburban setting with his parents and twin sister. His family's socio-economic status is middle class. Both parents are in their early 30s and have no history of genetic disorders.  Slide 3: Past Medical History Ethan was diagnosed with a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) at birth. There's no record of exposure to teratogenic factors during pregnancy. His growth milestones have generally been on target  although slower physical development has been observed. Ethan has had routine child immunizations and no significant illnesses or hospitalizations before.  Slide 4: Congenital Heart Disease Ethan's congenital heart disease is characterized by a hole in the wall dividing the two lower chambers of his heart (VSD). This allows oxygen-rich blood to mix with oxygen-poor blood  causing pressure in his heart's arteries and making his heart work harder.  Slide 5: Symptoms and Complications Ethan’s common symptoms include shortness of breath  fatigue  and frequent respiratory infections. Due to his VSD  there is a risk of developing heart failure  pulmonary hypertension  and endocarditis.  Slide 6: Management Ethan’s condition has been managed with heart healthy diet  antibiotics for respiratory infections  and routine cardiology check-ups. Surgical repair may be considered in the near future  depending on his condition.  Slide 7: Conclusion It is necessary to carry out regular follow-ups with Ethan’s cardiologist and monitor his growth closely. Parents have been educated about potential complications and the importance of regular health check-ups for early detection of any concerning changes.
13,3,5,diagnosis13-prompt3-trial5,Title: Case Study Presentation - Congenital Heart Disease  Slide 1: Introduction  The focus of this presentation is a case study on a 10-year-old female patient with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). CHD represents a group of interrelated structural abnormalities present at birth impacting cardiovascular development  function  and overall child health.  Slide 2: Demographics  Our patient is a 10-year-old Caucasian female  hailing from a middle-income family from Austin  Texas. She was diagnosed with CHD immediately after birth and has been receiving regular care at our pediatric cardiology unit.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  The patient was born full-term with no complications during pregnancy. Diagnosis of a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) was made within the first day of life using echocardiography. Due to her condition  she struggled with frequent respiratory infections and slow weight gain during her early years.   At age 2  she underwent a surgical procedure to close the VSD. Post-operative care and recuperation were uncomplicated  and substantial symptomatic relief was observed. Since then  the child has been on regular lifelong follow-up consultations with a cardiology specialist.  Slide 4: Family History   There's no history of CHD or any other severe genetic issues in the patient's immediate or extended family. Parents are non-consanguineous  and both are in healthy condition with no significant health issues.   Slide 5: Current CHD Management and Therapeutic Measures  Our patient is currently treated with a regime of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for the optimization of heart function. Regular echocardiograms have been scheduled judiciously to monitor her heart's overall status.   Slide 6: Future Implications and Prognosis  As the patient approaches her teen years  the focus will be on maintaining a balanced lifestyle  optimizing dietary habits  and encouraging age-suitable physical activities. The importance of regular check-ups  medication compliance  and understanding her condition's future implications will be increasingly emphasized  preparing her for a healthy and adjusted life with CHD.   Our patient’s CHD is being well-managed  and her prognosis  with ongoing care and lifestyle adjustment  is promising. Much progress has been made in the care of individuals with CHD  and a majority now survive into adulthood and lead productive  fulfilling lives.   Slide 7: Conclusion  Reviewing this case emphasizes the long-term care  management  and the supportive role that healthcare professionals play in managing congenital heart disease from infancy into adulthood. 
13,3,6,diagnosis13-prompt3-trial6,Title: A Case Study of Congital Heart Disease  Slide 1: Introduction An evaluation of clinical scenarios associated with congenital heart disease  noting the significant impact of accurate diagnostic procedures and prompt interventions.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient is a 1-year-old Caucasian male from a suburban socio-economic background who has been experiencing symptoms suggestive of congenital heart disease. His family does not report any history of genetic disorders.  Slide 3: Family and Past Medical History The patient is the second child in the family  with an elder sister who is healthy. Both parents are non-smokers with no significant cardiopulmonary disorders. The prenatal period was unremarkable. However  at birth  the baby had a low APGAR score and was admitted to the NICU for initial support.  Slide 4: Clinical Symptoms The infant was brought to the pediatrician because of frequent episodes of breathlessness  poor feeding  and inadequate weight gain. The pediatrician also observed that the child had a bluish tinge to his skin  especially on his lips and fingers  known as cyanosis.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Procedures An echocardiogram report confirmed a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a type of congenital heart disease. This includes four defects: ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta.   Slide 6: Treatment and Intervention  After the diagnosis  the infant was counseled for open-heart surgery to correct the structural heart defects. Medication management was initiated to control symptoms until the surgery  including drugs to reduce heart failure symptoms and to reduce the risk of blood clots.  Slide 7: Post Operative Care and Rehabilitation Post-surgery  the infant was shifted to the ICU for immediate care. He was then put under strict monitoring for his heart rate and rhythm  and round-the-care support was given to ensure proper feeding and weight gain.   Slide 8: Conclusion This case underlines the imperative role of early diagnosis and intervention in congenital heart disease. The overall prognosis following surgery is generally good if the problem is detected and treated timely. With time  the child will lead a comparatively healthy and normal life.   Slide 9: The Role of Medical Education It is our responsibility as medical educators to equip future healthcare professionals with the knowledge skills to manage such cases effectively.

13,3,12,diagnosis13-prompt3-trial12,Title: Congenital Heart Disease Case Presentation  Slide 1: Introduction  Today  we will be discussing the case of a patient suffering from congenital heart disease (CHD). CHD is a term given to a variety of heart disorders that occur as a structural defect in the heart. It is one of the most common types of birth defect.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient is a Caucasian female named Jane Doe. She's nine months old and was born full-term via normal vaginal delivery with no complications. Parents noticed she was having feeding difficulty and shortness of breath when crying.  Slide 3: Family and Patient History  There is no familial history of congenital heart disease. Jane is the first-born to non-consanguineous parents. During prenatal care  her mother didn’t show any red flags for CHD in ultrasound scans or blood tests. She was born with a weight of 3.5kgs without neonatal complications.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  Diagnostic evaluation at five months age revealed Jane had difficulty gaining weight and failure to thrive. She was hospitalized due to an acute respiratory infection at 7 months.   Slide 5: Clinical Indications & Diagnosis  Presenting symptoms included difficulty feeding  heavy and fast breathing during feeding  poor weight gain  excessive sweating  and constant fatigue. After physical exam and echocardiography  Jane was diagnosed with a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)  one of more common types of CHD.  Slide 6: Overview of Ventricular Septal Defect  Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) is a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart. It leads to the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood  overworking the heart and ultimately causing heart failure if untreated.  Slide 7: Current Management  Jane has been prescribed Digoxin and Diuretics. She is now requiring more specialized medical attention. Surgery might be necessary to patch the opening between ventricles  if it remains sizable and problematic.  Slide 8: Prognosis  With surgical intervention  the chances of leading normal lives are high for patients like Jane. Regular check-ups will be necessary to monitor the heart.   Slide 9: Conclusion   Early diagnosis and management of Congenital Heart Diseases like VSD is crucial for improving the quality of life of the patient. Even relatively simple interventions can often lead to significant improvements in functional status and significantly reduce a child's lifetime risk.   Slide 10: Q & A   Open for discussion and questions.

13,3,35,diagnosis13-prompt3-trial35,"Title: A Case Study on Congenital Heart Disease  Slide 1: Introduction -------------------------- This presentation explores a case involving a pediatric patient with congenital heart disease. As one of the most common types of birth defects and a leading cause of infant death worldwide  understanding congenital heart disease is essential to medical practice.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics ------------------------------- • Subject: Baby Boy (""""BB"""")  6 months old • Race: Biracial (Caucasian/African-American) • Location: Jacksonville  Florida  Slide 3: Past Medical History ------------------------------- • Birthweight: 3.5 kg • Mode of delivery: Normal Vaginal Delivery • Mother's Age: 29 years old • Prenatal History: Mother had gestational diabetes controlled by diet  prenatal vitamins  non-smoker  no alcohol or drug use during pregnancy. • Family History: No reported heart diseases in the family. However  the maternal grandmother has type 2 diabetes and maternal grandfather has hypertension.   Slide 4: Presenting Complaints ---------------------------------- At the age of 4 months  BB began showing symptoms. He presented excessive sweating  rapid breathing  and poor feeding habits. He was not gaining weight as expected (failure to thrive). Upon further examination  cyanosis (bluish tint to the skin  lips  and fingernails) was observed.  Slide 5: Diagnosis --------------------- Upon auscultation  a heart murmur was detected. An Echocardiogram was done immediately  which revealed a ventricular septal defect (hole between the lower chambers of the heart). The patient was diagnosed with congenital heart disease specifically  Ventricular Septal Defect or VSD.   Slide 6: Management and Treatment ------------------------------------- The patient was placed under careful observation and regular follow-ups were scheduled. Given BB's age and the size of the defect  conservative management was adopted initially. It was hope that the VSD might close on its own. Heart-healthy feeding strategies were advised to manage the weight gain. Diuretics were provided to decrease fluid buildup in BB's lungs.  Conclusion: ----------- This case study is a typical scenario of congenital heart disease in infancy. The key to a successful outcome in such cases is early detection  close monitoring  and timely intervention  taking both medical and surgical treatment into account based upon the severity and progression of the disease."

13,3,60,diagnosis13-prompt3-trial60,Slide 1: Introduction  Good day  everyone. Today  we will discuss a case about a patient with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)  one of the most common types of birth defects affecting the structure of a newborn's heart.  Slide 2: Patient Information & Demographics Our patient is a 12-month-old male infant born in the United States. The subject is of Asian American ethnicity and is part of the middle socio-economic class.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The infant was delivered full-term after a complication-free pregnancy. The mother reported no infections  illnesses  substance use  or medications taken other than prenatal vitamins during pregnancy. The child's family history indicates no cases of CHD.  Slide 4: Presenting Problem & Initial Diagnosis The child was noted to have blue discoloration of lips and fingertips  difficulty in feeding  and slow weight gain since birth. The pediatrician noticed a heart murmur at birth. These symptoms led to the suspicion of CHD  the diagnosis of which was confirmed after an echocardiogram showed a large ventricular septal defect (VSD).  Slide 5: Pathophysiology of CHD in this Case A VSD is a hole in the wall separating the heart's lower chambers or ventricles. Due to this defect  oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle mixes with oxygen-rich blood in the left ventricle and is then pumped back into the body instead of to the lungs.  Slide 6: Management and Treatment Given his age and symptoms  the child was recommended for surgical closure of the VSD. He was closely monitored postoperatively  showing marked improvement in feeding and weight gain.  Slide 7: Prognosis and Patient Education Prognosis post-surgery is generally good  although regular follow-ups with a cardiologist are required. Parental education on understanding the importance of regular check-ups  noting any recurring or new symptoms  and maintaining a heart-healthy lifestyle as the child grows older is essential.   Slide 8: Summary To sum up  this clinical case highlighted the importance of early detection  intervention  and management of congenital heart defects such as a VSD in ensuring better life quality.   Slide 9: Implications for Future Practice The case emphasizes the role of the healthcare team in early screening  diagnosis  intervention  long-term monitoring  and parental education in managing children with CHD effectively.  Slide 10: Questions Now  let's proceed to questions and open the floor for discussions.
13,3,61,diagnosis13-prompt3-trial61,Slide 1: Patient Introduction  Our case revolves around a 3-month old female baby  named Lily  of Asian descent. Lily was brought to our care upon displaying symptoms of feeding difficulties and rapid breathing.   Slide 2: Past Medical and Family History   Lily is the first child of non-consanguineous  healthy parents. There's no known family history of congenital heart disease. Her mother had a normal  uncomplicated pregnancy  but did not attend any prenatal scans. Lily hasn't had any significant illnesses and her vaccinations are up-to-date.   Slide 3: Symptoms and Clinical Examination  Upon clinical assessment  Lily presented with tachypnea and slight cyanosis. Additionally  during routine physical exams  a heart murmur was detected  arousing suspicion of congenital heart disease.   Slide 4: Diagnostic Procedures  To further investigate  an echocardiogram was ordered which confirmed the presence of a congenital cardiac anomaly  revealing a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot.   Slide 5: Tetralogy of Fallot   Tetralogy of Fallot is a complex congenital heart defect  involving four abnormalities: Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)  Pulmonary Stenosis  Right Ventricular Hypertrophy  and Overriding Aorta.   Slide 6: Current Status and Treatment   Currently  Lily is being medically managed with beta-blockers to decrease cyanotic episodes and improve feeding and growth. However  definitive treatment involves surgical repair  which will be planned in the near future.  Slide 7: Prognosis   Without corrective surgery the prognosis is poor  but with timely detection and intervention through the form of surgical repair  most children with Tetralogy of Fallot lead a normal life.  Slide 8: Conclusion   This case serves as a reminder of the vital importance of prenatal screening and early diagnosis in congenital heart disease  enabling effective treatment plans to be implemented promptly. It also emphasizes the need for parental education about the potential signs of neonatal distress associated with these conditions.
13,3,62,diagnosis13-prompt3-trial62,Title: Congenital Heart Disease - A Detailed Case Study   Slide 1: Introduction Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a defect in the structure of the heart and great vessels present at birth. It is the most common type of birth defect which often leads to further complications.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Patient X is a six-month-old male infant  born full-term  with a birth weight of 3.6 kg. The child is predominately breastfed and is up to date on vaccinations. The parents are non-consanguineous and there is no family history of congenital heart disease.  Slide 3: Clinical Presentation Patient X has been exhibiting symptoms of rapid breathing  fatigue  and reduced weight and height gain compared to infants of a similar age. The child shows signs of cyanosis  particularly around the lips and fingernails.  Slide 4: Past Medical History During pregnancy  the mother had routine prenatal screening  but no anomalies were detected. Birth history was normal; however  an irregular heart rhythm was noticed during a routine check-up after birth.   Slide 5: Diagnosis Process With the initial suspicion of CHD  an echocardiogram was performed which showed a defect in the heart’s structure - a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and pulmonary stenosis  confirming the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot.  Slide 6: Management and Treatment Given the patient’s age and the severity of the defect  the doctors opted for early surgical intervention - complete repair of the defect. A right ventricular to pulmonary artery (RV-PA) conduit has been planned. Postoperative care will include antibiotics  diuretics  and close monitoring of the patient's progress.   Slide 7: Prognosis With surgical intervention and close follow-up care  infants with this condition have an excellent prognosis  with survival rates approaching that of the general population. Activities may be restricted based on the underlying nature of the defect and patient's tolerance level.  Slide 8: Conclusion Early detection  timely surgical intervention  and close postoperative follow-up are vital for ensuring the best outcomes for children suffering from congenital heart disease.

13,3,69,diagnosis13-prompt3-trial69,Title: Case Presentation: Congital Heart Disease  I. Introduction  Our case revolves around a patient with congenital heart disease (CHD). Congenital heart disease is a term used for a variety of birth defects that affect the normal workings of the heart.  II. Patient Demographics  The patient is a 6-year-old Caucasian male  weighing 20 kg and a height of 3ft 8in  from Buffalo  New York. He lives with his parents and younger sibling. He attends kindergarten and enjoys interactive outdoor games  although lately  he gets easily tired.  III. Past Medical History  The patient was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery with an uncomplicated neonatal course. However  he was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart disease  during his 1-month check-up. He underwent an initial corrective procedure known as Blalock-Taussig Shunt placement at three months old.  The patient's parents noticed symptoms of fatigue  shortness of breath  and occasional bluish skin that prompted regular hospital visits. The boy has also been underdeveloped compared to his peers which is likely due to a decreased cardiac output affecting his growth.  IV. Current Medical History  Currently  the patient presents with an increased frequency of cyanotic spells  especially during intense physical activities. His pallor has worsened over the past two weeks. Furthermore  echocardiography confirmed that the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction seems to have significantly increased.  V. Diagnostic Tests  To manage the condition better  further diagnostic tests were ordered- 12 lead ECG  chest x-ray  MRI  and cardiac catheterisation. His oxygen saturation levels were also monitored  which showed low levels during cyanotic spells.   VI. Conclusion  The prognosis for children diagnosed with CHD like Tetralogy of Fallot has greatly improved due to advancements in surgical and medical management. Our patient would probably need another surgery  which would depend on the results of the diagnostic tests and his physiological reaction to the current condition.  Timely surgical intervention  coupled with careful postoperative care and regular follow-up  will be crucial for this young patient’s wellness moving forward. Patient and parental education regarding the nature of the disorder is already ongoing  to better equip them in coping with this lifelong condition.

13,3,74,diagnosis13-prompt3-trial74,Title: Pediatric Congenital Heart Disease: A Case Study   Slide 1: Introduction This presentation is a case study of a pediatric patient diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CHD).  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient  referred to as 'Patient X'  is a 3-year-old Caucasian male. He lives in an urban area with his parents and younger sibling.  Slide 3: Brief on Congenital Heart Disease Congenital heart disease (CHD) refers to one or more problems with the heart's structure that exists since birth. Factors likely include genetics and environmental aspects.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  Shortly after birth  Patient X was diagnosed with a murmur  which led to early detection of CHD. His specific defect falls under the tetralogy of Fallot (ToF)  characterized by four anatomical abnormalities of the heart. There is no significant medical history concerning immediate family members  making it more likely a fluke genetic mutation rather than a hereditary condition.  Slide 5: Previous Interventions An initial surgery was conducted during infancy to alleviate some symptoms  but Patient X was foreseen to need further surgical corrections later on. The patient has no history of consenting to medical therapies and no known allergies.  Slide 6: Current Medical Status Currently  Patient X shows signs of cyanosis and has difficulty during rigorous activities. There is a history of an average of one Tet spell per year  and a recent decrease in growth velocity. These could be indicators of necessary surgery in the future.  Slide 7: Anticipated Care and Management Pediatric cardiologists closely monitor Patient X's clinical progression. They anticipate another surgery to amend the Tetralogy of Fallot in the next six months to a year. The importance of multidisciplinary team involvement is recognized to ensure comprehensive care.

Tests for CHD are usually done during pregnancy or soon after delivery.   Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our subject is a 6-month-old Asian male infant who was brought in by his parents for an evaluation of a heart murmur noticed at his 6-month routine check. The family history is significant for bicuspid aortic valve disease on the paternal side.  Slide 3: Past Medical History The child was delivered naturally at full term with no reported complications during pregnancy or labor. The mother had regular antenatal follow-ups and all reports were normal. However  the child had been experiencing difficulties in feeding and slower weight gain compared to averages for his age.  Slide 4: Physical Findings Upon examination  the child was alert  but smaller for his age. Listen to his heart revealed a murmur of grade 3/6 in intensity in the pulmonic area  with a mechanical S2.  Slide 5: Investigation Results Further investigation via an Echocardiogram showed a congenital disease known as Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). This condition included four abnormalities: VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect)  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta.  Slide 6: Discussion This condition is causing the child significant issues  mainly the ability of his heart to pump oxygenated blood to his body causing his feeding difficulties and poor weight gain  commonly referred to as 'Failure to Thrive'.   Slide 7: Treatment Plan The plan includes initially managing symptoms with medication to ensure a stable condition  followed by definitive repair via open heart surgery within the first year of life. This will enable the child to live a healthy life with regular cardiac follow-ups.  Slide 8: Conclusion Congenital heart diseases  such as Tetralogy of Fallot  can initially present as mild symptoms  underscoring the importance of thorough investigations when a heart murmur is detected. Early diagnosis and management can play a vital role in these infants' lives.  Slide 9: Questions? Encourage the audience to ask questions and engage in a discussion about the case and how to recognize and manage similar situations.

13,3,79,diagnosis13-prompt3-trial79,Slide 1: Introduction Our presentation today involves a comprehensive study of a patient who has been diagnosed with congenic heart disease (CHD). We will be looking into their demographics  past medical history  and how these factors combined with their current medical condition affects their health.  Slide 2: Patient Profile Patient X is a two-year-old male child with parents of Hispanic descent. His family is from a lower socioeconomic background and lives in a semi-urban area. There is a history of heart disease on his father's side of the family.  Slide 3: Medical History The patient was prenatally diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot at 24 weeks gestation via fetal echocardiography. The child did not require neonatal intervention and was discharged home on standard newborn medications. He was closely followed up with pediatric cardiology  and his physical development has been normal.  Slide 4: Present Medical Condition At present  the child is primarily experiencing 'cyanotic spells'  known to be symptoms of his condition - Tetralogy of Fallot. He has been hospitalized twice for these spells and is currently taking medications to manage the symptoms.   Slide 5: Family History The patient's paternal aunt died at the age of 20 due to an undiagnosed heart disease  which is presumptively attributed to congenital heart defect. There are no instances of any heart disease or related conditions on the maternal side of his family.  Slide 6: Linking History with Present Condition Given the family history of heart disease  along with early diagnosis  it is feasible to deduce that the child's CHD is a result of a genetic predisposition. The current health condition requires consistent monitoring and treatment to ensure the best possible growth and development for the child.  Slide 7: Conclusion Despite living with CHD  our young patient shows a positive prognosis due to early detection and ongoing medical care. Maintaining this trend can help him lead a fulfilling life. It also underscores the value of initial screening and regular follow-ups for children with congenital heart disease  especially those coming from families with a history of heart disease.

13,3,98,diagnosis13-prompt3-trial98,Title: Congenital Heart Disease Case Presentation  Slide 1: Introduction This presentation focuses on a case study of congenital heart disease  which is a structural abnormality of the heart present at birth.  Slide 2: Demographics Our patient is a 6-year old Caucasian male child  currently residing in New York. He is a first-born child  from a non-consanguineous marriage. The child was delivered full term  without any complications  and developed normally until this point.  Slide 3: Presenting Complaints His parents sought medical attention due to recurrent respiratory infections  reduced tolerance for physical activities compared to his peers and unexplained weight loss.   Slide 4: Past Medical History The patient's past medical history is notable for multiple episodes of pneumonia in childhood. Aside from these  he generally has had normal growth and development patterns for his age. He has no acute illnesses  and his vaccination schedule is up-to-date.  Slide 5: Family History The family history is significant for heart diseases  with the patient's mother diagnosed with atrial septal defect in her childhood  which was surgically corrected.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Evaluation An extensive cardiovascular examination revealed a heart murmur indicative of a heart defect. Further testing with an echocardiogram confirmed the presence of a ventricular septal defect (VSD).  Slide 7: Clinical Course Our patient's diagnosis led to optimal medical management to control his symptoms. Given his mother's medical background and the severity of his VSD  he was referred to a pediatric cardiologist for potential surgical review.  Slide 8: Conclusion This case highlights the importance of early recognition of congenital heart defects  potentially leading to better prognosis and quality of life. Clinicians need to take into account the full clinical picture  including thorough family and personal medical histories. Furthermore  the case underscores the significance of patient education  as prompt medical help was sought due to parental awareness.  Slide 9: Take Home Message Congenital heart diseases are common and can be challenging to diagnose due to varied symptoms. As healthcare providers  we must maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical presentations in the pediatric population for a timely and correct diagnosis.
13,3,99,diagnosis13-prompt3-trial99,Title: Understanding Congital Heart Disease Through a Clinical Lens   Slide 1: Introduction The incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) is around 1 out of every 100 births in the United States  making it the most common type of birth defect. Today  we'll discuss the case of a patient presenting with CHD.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  The patient is a 2-month-old Caucasian male born at full term via vaginal delivery. The birth was uneventful  and pregnancy scans didn't detect any anomalies. The mother had access to prenatal care  had an uncomplicated pregnancy  and has no known genetic or health issues.  Slide 3: Patient Medical History The patient has no chronic illnesses and no known allergies. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date.  Slide 4: Current Presentation The infant was brought to the pediatric clinic by his parents concerned about his frequent episodes of rapid breathing and poor feeding. They also reported that he becomes extremely lethargic after feeding  Slide 5: Diagnosis & Findings Up on physical examination  the infant was noted to be slightly cyanotic and had decreased exercise tolerance. An echocardiogram confirmed a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)  a type of CHD where a hole in the heart wall separates the lower chambers.  Slide 6: Management Strategy The child was referred to a pediatric cardiologist for cardiac catheterization and subsequently  open-heart surgery was done to repair the defect. The postoperative course was uneventful. Currently  the child is receiving appropriate medication and is under regular cardiological follow-up.  Slide 7: Conclusion This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of CHD in newborns and infants  given the subtle signs and symptoms. It highlights the importance of early detection and intervention to have successful outcomes.

Slide 4: Past Medical History John was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot at birth. The condition involves four defects within the heart's structures  including a ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an over-riding aorta. He has been under regular follow-up since.  Slide 5: Surgical History John underwent corrective surgery at 6 months old to repair the ventricular septal defect and relieve the pulmonary stenosis.   Slide 6: Family History His family history includes a father with a coronary artery disease and a mother with hypertension. There is no known congenital heart disease in his family.  Slide 7: Medications John has been on Propranolol to lessen the possibility of cyanotic spells and Furosemide to prevent fluid buildup since post-surgery.  Slide 8: Progress and Current Symptoms Over the years  John's general health has been good  with manageable cyanotic spells. However  recently he has experienced increasing episodes of breathlessness and cyanosis during physical exertion.  Slide 9: Potential Concerns Given his symptoms  there may be a need for further surgical intervention or medication modifications. Additionally  considerations for the impact of his condition on long-term health  lifestyle  and potential complications need to be made.  Slide 10: Conclusion Managing congenital heart disease requires a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach  focusing not only on the heart condition itself but on the patient's overall wellbeing. John's case highlights the importance of close monitoring  early intervention  and regular reassessment for patients with congenital heart disease.

He frequently gets infections that require prolonged antibiotic therapy. He was born at term without any complications.  Past Medical History: None. This is the infant's first significant reported health anomaly.  Family History: Mother has type II diabetes. Father is healthy. No known family history of congenital heart disease.  Physical Exam: Upon examination  the infant appears in distress with noticeable shortness of breath and mild cyanosis. There is an audible heart murmur. The infant is below the average weight and height for his age.  Problem Representation: A 4-month-old male infant presenting with symptoms indicative of a probable congenital heart disease  including tachypnea  poor feeding  frequent infections  failure to thrive  a heart murmur  and mild cyanosis. There is no significant family history of heart disease but mother has type II diabetes.  Needs further diagnostic evaluation to understand the nature and severity of the congenital heart condition.
13,5,2,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial2,Patient Information: Male baby  6 months old  Caucasian.  Chief Complaint: Difficulty feeding  excessive sweating  and episodes of rapid breathing.  History of Present Illness: The mother reports the baby has had difficulty feeding since birth. She has also noticed the baby perspiring heavily  particularly after feedings. She has also observed the baby experiencing bouts of rapid breathing  unrelated to exertion or temperature. The baby has gaining weight but at a slower pace compared to healthy infants of the same age.  Past Medical History: No prior hospitalizations. This is the first child for the parents and no prenatal complications reported.   Family History: No significant heart diseases or genetic conditions in family history. Mother's pregnancy was not complicated by infections or exposure to substances that might cause a baby to develop congenital heart disease.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  the baby is alert but appears fatigued. Auscultation reveals a heart murmur. The extremities are cool to touch and peripheral pulses are diminished. The liver is palpable below the rib cage suggesting liver enlargement.  Assessment: The symptoms and clinical presentation suggest a possible congenital heart disease which can be causing reduced blood flow and oxygen delivery to the body leading to the symptoms of sweating  rapid breathing and decreased feeding due to fatigue. The heart murmur  cooling extremities and liver enlargement further supports this suspicion. Further diagnostic evaluation including echocardiogram and other imaging studies are required to confirm the diagnosis and ascertain the type of congenital heart disease. Genetics consultation might also be useful for diagnosis  as well as guiding family planning.   Plan: Medical management to support this patient’s cardiovascular function will be considered once the exact type and severity of congenital heart disease are known. Cardiac surgery might be discussed according to diagnostic findings. The parents should be informed about the disease  its implications  the need for follow-up appointments and monitoring  signs of worsening condition  and the optimal feeding methods for the baby in the interim. The family should also be linked with support resources including social work and psychology.

No known family history of congenital heart disease.  Presenting Symptoms: During her recent health check-up  the pediatrician noted symptoms such as tachypnea (increased respiratory rate)  diaphoresis  and poor weight gain. On physical exam  a heart murmur was detected along with signs of congestive heart failure. The child appeared tired and showed signs of exercise intolerance during physical activities. The infant's mother also reported episodes of rapid breathing and decreased appetite during feeding. The symptoms combined with the physical exam findings led to a suspicion of possible congenital heart disease.
13,5,4,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial4,"Patient Profile: A 1-year-old Caucasian male infant.  Medical History:  The infant was born nine months ago with a congenital heart disorder diagnosed as Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF). Family history is significant for congenital heart disease  presenting in both maternal and paternal grandparents.   Presenting Symptoms:  The infant has been experiencing episodes of cyanosis  especially during feeding and crying  known as """"Tet spells"""". The baby also exhibits signs of breathlessness and fatigue during such episodes. On examination  he has clubbing of fingers  a systolic murmur  failure to thrive  and a history of delayed milestones. He is also below the 5th percentile for height and weight  which may be attributable to the increased metabolic demand of his heart condition.  Past Medical and Surgical History:  No prior surgeries. No history of other medical treatment or hospitalizations.  Allergies:  No known drug allergies.  Current Medication: Propranolol prescribed for the control of Tet spells. No other medication being taken currently.  Physical Examination:  Vital signs stable; temperature 98.6°F  pulse 110 beats per minute  respiratory rate 30/minute  blood pressure 85/65 mmHg. Heart sounds show a loud systolic ejection murmur in the left upper sternal border. Clubbing noticed in fingers. Other physical examination findings are normal.   Investigations:  Echocardiography shows pulmonary stenosis  ventricular septal defect  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta – consistent with the diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot.  Impression:  This is a case of a 1-year-old infant with congenital heart disease (primarily ToF)  presenting with classic symptoms of """"tet spells""""  including cyanosis during feeding and episodes of fussiness  along with evidence of failure to thrive.    Plan:  Continuation of Propranolol therapy as prescribed and consideration for total correction with intracardiac repair surgery after consultation with a pediatric cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon. Regular follow-ups are recommended for monitoring growth and symptom progress. A high-calorie diet is suggested to help with any weight gain issues."
13,5,5,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial5,Demographics: A three-month-old female baby born prematurely at 24 weeks.  Medical History: The baby was born prematurely in an out of hospital setting and was admitted to the NICU due to respiratory distress. The infant was diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and has required supplemental oxygen since birth. A grade 3-4 systolic murmur was detected on day 2 of life  so an echocardiogram was performed. The echo indicated the presence of a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) that was causing increased blood flow to her lungs  compounding the respiratory issues from her bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The PDA was managed medically initially  but failed  so she underwent surgical closure.   Presenting Symptoms: Following the procedure  the baby continues to struggle with poor growth and ongoing issues such as feeding difficulties  sweating during feeds  rapid breathing  fast heart rate  and persistent lower respiratory tract infections. In the latest physical examination  she has been spotted with mild cyanosis. Furthermore  she has presented recurrent episodes of fainting in the last two weeks.

13,5,12,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial12,Patient Presentation: A three-month-old Caucasian female from middle-class family background presents to the pediatric cardiology unit for evaluation.  Medical History: The patient was born at term  with a birth weight of 3.1 kilograms. The postnatal period was uneventful  but during a routine neonatal screening  a heart murmur was detected and the patient was referred for further evaluation. There is no family history of heart disease.  Current Illness: For the past one month  the patient's mother noticed frequent episodes of fast breathing  excessive sweating especially during feeding and the baby seems to fatigue more easily. Other symptoms include poor weight gain and a persistently rapid heartbeat.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  the baby has signs consistent with cardiac failure including underweight for age (4.2 kilograms)  tachypnea (rapid breathing rate of 60 per minute)  tachycardia (heart rate of 140 beats per minute)  and lower extremity edema. A systolic murmur is noted on cardiac auscultation.  In this setting  these clinical features could suggest a diagnosis of congenital heart disease  possibly a large ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus that has led to heart failure. Further diagnostic evaluation including echocardiogram and chest X-ray is indicated.
13,5,13,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial13,Patient is a two-month-old Hispanic male  JC  born full-term via normal vaginal delivery and now presenting with poor feeding  rapid breathing  and cyanosis. He experienced a one-month NICU course post delivery due to initial presentation of such symptoms. His prenatal course was uncomplicated  and he has no known drug allergies. Family history is significant for heart disease on his maternal side. Pertinent negatives include absence of other congenital anomalies or developmental delays. Physical examination reveals an underfed infant with intercostal retractions and a grade 3/6 pansystolic murmur best heard over the left lower sternal border that increases with Valsalva maneuver. Rest of the examination was unremarkable. Mother states JC has been more fatigued than his twin brother and has difficulty gaining weight. Synthesized with his clinical history and family history  his signs and symptoms are suggestive of a potential congenital heart disease  possibly ventricular septal defect. Further diagnostic work-up and referral to a pediatric cardiologist are necessary.
13,5,14,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial14,Patient Profile:   The patient is a single  6-month-old Caucasian male  born full term through normal delivery. He lives with his parents in New York City and is currently on breast milk feeding.  Medical History:   The patient has been diagnosed with congenital heart disease since birth. There is no history of any allergies. Immunization is up to date as per the age. There is no significant family history of cardiovascular diseases or sudden cardiac deaths in the family.  Presenting Symptoms:  Over the past couple of weeks  the patient has been more irritable than usual and tires easily  particularly during feeding  sometimes even sweating. The parents have also noticed that he seems to breath faster than usual. On physical examination  a heart murmur was heard  his pulse was weak  and his skin color had a slight blueish hue especially on the lips and fingers. The patient also shows signs of poor weight gain and slower than average growth pattern. Chest radiography showed heart enlargement with pulmonary vascular markings. An ECG indicated right ventricular hypertrophy and right atrial enlargement while echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot. The patient's symptoms such as cyanosis  dyspnea  feeding difficulties  slow growth  and poor weight gain are likely due to decreased oxygen supply to the body tissues caused by the cardiac defect.
13,5,15,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial15,Patient: 2-month old Hispanic male   Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  from the neonatal period.  Presenting Complaints: Over the past week  the mother has noticed increasing episodes of cyanosis  especially during feeding and crying. The cyanosis fades away with rest. In addition  the baby is not gaining weight adequately and has experienced frequent episodes of shortness of breath. The mother also reports the baby's lips and skin turn blue during these episodes.  Clinical Examination: On physical examination  the baby presents with a heart murmur  poor weight gain  and clubbing of the fingers and toes. Shortness of breath and rapid heart rate were also observed. Pulse oximetry revealed hypoxemia.  Background Information: Congenital heart diseases are the most common type of birth defect. They result from a defect in the structure of the heart and great vessels during fetal development. Tetralogy of Fallot is a type of congenital heart defect that features four problems including a hole between the lower chambers of the heart  an obstruction from the heart to the lungs  the aorta lies over the hole in the lower chambers  and the muscle surrounding the lower right chamber becomes overly thickened. Tet spells  or episodes of bluish color to the skin occurring in children with TOF  typically occur in infants who are older than 2 months of age. The majority of children with TOF do not have a genetic disorder. However  certain conditions  such as Down syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome  have been linked to TOF.
13,5,16,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial16,Patient Profile: A 2-month-old Hispanic male infant born via normal delivery with no maternal complications.  Relevant Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with Down Syndrome shortly after birth. Mother has a history of rheumatic heart disease. Family history also includes other congenital heart diseases.   Presenting Symptoms: The infant was brought to the clinic due to frequent cyanosis  especially during feeding  and observable difficulty in breathing. The parents reported poor weight gain and episodes of excessive perspiration. On physical examination  a heart murmur was also noted.  Assessment: Given the patient's cyanotic episodes  tachypnea  and heart murmur  along with his diagnosis of Down Syndrome and family medical history  the diagnosis of a congenital heart defect should be considered. Further diagnostic tests including EKG and echocardiogram should be considered to confirm heart disease and evaluate the degree of cardiac malfunction.
13,5,17,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial17,Patient Profile:  A 1-month-old Caucasian male infant delivered at full term with birth weight appropriate for gestational age.  Medical History: The infant was seen by the pediatrician for well-child care and was noted to be cyanotic  specifically around the lips and extremities. Mother reports difficulty in feeding  shortness of breath  excessive sleepiness  failure to gain weight  and episodes of fast  labored breathing after feeding. No history of any congenital anomalies or genetic disorders in the family. Mother's prenatal screenings and ultrasound were unremarkable  and she had a non-eventful pregnancy without any tobacco  alcohol  or illicit drug use.  Presentation:  On physical examination  the infant appeared malnourished and pale. Vitals were normal except for elevated heart rate and respiratory rate. Heart auscultation revealed a systolic murmur. Oxygen saturation in room air was below normal. The infant was in obvious distress with signs of respiratory difficulty.   This clinical presentation suggests a possible case of cyanotic congenital heart disease  including lesions such as transposition of the great arteries  tetralogy of Fallot  or tricuspid atresia. Further diagnostic investigation by echocardiography and possibly cardiac catheterization is necessary for definitive diagnosis and planning for necessary surgical intervention. Follow-up with a pediatric cardiologist is immediately warranted.

13,5,21,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial21,Patient Profile:   A 6-month-old Asian male infant  Medical History:   The patient was diagnosed with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) shortly after birth during screening through a routine pulse oximetry examination. He was born at full-term after an uncomplicated gestation period  and there was no reported history of maternal drug or alcohol abuse  rubella infection  or diabetes during pregnancy. The child’s parents are non-consanguineous with no known family history of congenital heart diseases.   Presenting Symptoms:   The child presents today with symptoms including persistent tachypnea  frequent respiratory infections  and cyanosis  mainly upon exertion. He also demonstrates poor weight gain and pallor. On cardiac examination  there is noted cardiomegaly with a palpable thrill. A parasternal heave is evident on examination. Abnormal heart sounds are present  with a characteristic systolic murmur detected along the left sternal border.   Upon further investigation  oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) are observed to be trending at lower than normal ranges  consistent with the cyanotic appearance of the child. Chest X-ray  Echocardiogram  and Electrocardiogram (ECG) all suggest structural abnormalities  likely Tetralogy of Fallot  which include Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)  Overriding Aorta  Pulmonary Stenosis  and Right Ventricular Hypertrophy.    The infant’s symptoms and medical history are concerning for the progression of the congenital heart defect and may suggest a necessity to consider surgical intervention. Regular follow-ups and thorough monitoring are primary undertakings to manage the condition at this juncture.

She tends to sweat more than normal  especially during feeds and her extremities show signs of cyanosis.  Physical Examination: Examination reveals a prominent precordium with a palpable parasternal heave. On auscultation  a loud  harsh pansystolic murmur is heard best at the left lower sternal border with radiation to the back  and a mid-diastolic rumbling murmur is heard at the apex.  Given her age  symptoms  and genetic condition  there is high suspicion of congenital heart disease  likely Tetralogy of Fallot or Atrioventricular Septal Defect (AVSD) – both often associated with Down syndrome. Echocardiography and further cardiac evaluation are recommended.
13,5,39,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial39,Patient Presentation: A 2-month-old Hispanic female with a past medical history significant for prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot  presents with her parents to the pediatric office for follow-up evaluation.   History of Present Illness: The child's parents report progressive symptoms of increased work of breathing  episodes of bluish discoloration especially during feeding and crying  and poor weight gain since birth. There is no report of fever  cough  vomiting  or diarrhea. They also note she seems more tired than usual.  Past Medical History: Prenatal ultrasound at 20 weeks gestation revealed a congenital heart defect  further diagnostic evaluations postnatally confirmed Tetralogy of Fallot. No other medical history or surgical history is present as patient is a neonate.  Family History: No known family history of congenital heart disease or other genetic disorders.   Review of Systems: Patient is too young for reliable report. Based on parental observations  the patient seems to have shortness of breath  difficult and reduced feeding  and overall appears lethargic.   Physical Exam: On examination  the child appears small for her age  pale  and slightly cyanotic particularly around the lips. Decreased breath sounds heard upon auscultation. Heart sounds include a harsh systolic ejection murmur heard loudest at the left upper sternal border. Rest of the physical examination within normal limits for age.   Assessment: This 2-month-old female with a known diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot presents with symptoms suggestive of cyanotic spells  attributed to her underlying congenital heart pathology. Immediate cardiology consultation and intervention might be necessary.

There is decreased breath sound in the left lung and a harsh pan systolic murmur noted in left third intercostal space along the lower sternal border. The infant exhibits poor feeding and has below-average weight gain.   This case presentation might suggest complex congenital heart disease  perhaps a form of cyanotic heart disease  such as Tetralogy of Fallot  or a left-to-right shunt  such as ventricular septal defect or atrioventricular canal defect. Further evaluation is clearly recommended and should be prompt."
13,5,41,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial41,Demographics: A 6-month-old infant boy  Hispanic  Medical history: The patient was born at full term with regular prenatal checkups displaying no abnormal findings. Vaccination is up-to-date as per the pediatric vaccination schedule. No known family history of congenital heart diseases or other genetic disorders. No history of significant illness since birth.  Presenting symptoms: The mother reports noticing the baby turning blue during crying or feeding. She also noticed the baby presenting signs of fatigue frequently and was not gaining weight properly. The pediatrician reported a significant finding of heart murmur during a regular check-up. The infant also displayed symptoms of breathlessness and some fluid retention.   Given these signs and symptoms  the attending physician suspects a case of Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart disease  and orders for further diagnostic tests including echocardiogram  chest X-ray  and pulse oximetry.
13,5,42,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial42,Demographics: A Caucasian  6-week-old male infant presented to the clinic with his mother for a routine pediatric checkup.  History: The patient was born at 38 weeks by normal vaginal delivery. No significant complications were reported at birth. However  the baby had a positive family history with his maternal grandfather diagnosed with congenital heart disease.  Presenting Symptoms: Upon examination  the infant showed symptoms of poor feeding  excessive sweating  and appeared quite fatigued. The mother reported that the baby seemed to be having difficulty breathing  especially during feedings  and was not gaining weight appropriately. The pediatrician noted a bluish hue to the baby’s skin (cyanosis) and an irregular heartbeat upon auscultation which was perceived as a heart murmur.  The combination of the general fatigue  difficulty feeding  inadequate weight gain  breathing problems  cyanosis and irregular heartbeat  especially in the context of a hereditary predisposition  is suggestive of a probable case of congenital heart disease. Further diagnostic testing will be necessary to ascertain the type and severity of the condition.
13,5,43,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial43,Patient is a 6-month-old male infant  first born to non-consanguineous parents with no significant family history of congenital anomalies or heart diseases. Patient was born at term with no obstetric complications  but was noted to have cyanosis  and difficulty feeding shortly after birth. It was also noticed that the infant became excessively sweaty during feedings.  On physical examination  there was central cyanosis  tachypnea  and tachycardia. Auscultation of the heart showed a continuous precordial murmur most prominent over the left upper sternal border and radiating over entire precordium. Differential cyanosis was observed along with differential blood pressure in upper and lower extremities. Pulse oximetry showed oxygen saturation of 80% on room air.  The infant was screened with echocardiography  which revealed truncus arteriosus and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with bidirectional shunting. It showed that both the aorta and pulmonary artery were originating from a common arterial trunk overriding a large ventricular septal defect (VSD). There was moderate pulmonary hypertension present.  The infant's diagnostic workup is consistent with the diagnosis of complex congenital heart disease  specifically truncus arteriosus with associated patent ductus arteriosus and ventricular septal defect. This explains the infant's symptom complex  including cyanosis  difficulty feeding  sweating during feeding and continuous heart murmur.
13,5,44,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial44,Patient is a 2-week old  Asian American male  born full term with no immediate post-natal complications.

13,5,49,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial49,Patient Information: A 2-week-old Asian female infant  born at full term  39 weeks gestation without complications.  Medical History: The patient was diagnosed antenatally with a congenital heart defect. Mother was healthy throughout the pregnancy  with no known exposure to known teratogens or viral infections. The child underwent all newborn screenings and received all necessary vaccinations. Genetic testing was done due to the heart defect identified in the ultrasound; no congenital malformations or genetic syndromes were identified.  Presenting Symptoms: The infant was feeding well initially but began showing signs of breathing difficulties and poor feeding in the second week. Parent(s) noticed increased episodes of tachypnea  sweating during feeding  and less wet diapers than in the first week.  Examination Findings: Upon physical examination  the baby appears dyspneic both at rest and with minimal exertion such as feeding. An audible heart murmur is observed  with the rest of the cardiac exam revealing no other external cardiac anomalies. The child is small for her age  exhibiting failure to thrive.   Summary: Given the infant's prenatal diagnosis of a congenital heart defect  coupled with her current symptoms of feeding difficulties  tachypnea  failure to thrive and presence of a heart murmur  there is a high suspicion for a critical congenital heart disease  specifically left-sided obstructive lesion -typically coarctation of the aorta  hypo plastic left heart syndrome or critical aortic stenosis. Further diagnostic investigation including echocardiography is indicated.

13,5,62,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial62,Patient Profile: A male infant  6 months old  born full term  Asian descent  first child in the family  from a non-consanguineous marriage.  Medical History: The infant has been diagnosed with Down syndrome via genetic testing after birth due to characteristic physical markers. There is no known family history of heart disease. The parents report several episodes of the infant turning blue  especially while feeding  along with episodes of rapid breathing and poor weight gain.  Symptoms on Examination: On physical examination  the infant is smaller than average with hallmark features consist with Down syndrome  including flat facial features  upward slanting eyes and small ears. Auscultation of the heart reveals a loud  harsh holosystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border  along with a mid-diastolic rumble at the apex. The peripheral pulses are full and bounding  and there is mild subcostal and intercostal retraction indicating respiratory distress.  Given the infant's Down syndrome diagnosis  the presence of a heart murmur  and the symptoms of cyanosis during feeds  rapid breathing  and poor growth  the suspicion is high for congenital heart disease. The infant's signs and symptomatology are suggestive of a possible atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)  which is commonly associated with Down syndrome. Further investigations need to be carried out to confirm the same and plan an appropriate treatment strategy.

Presenting Problem: Parents report several episodes of unexplained cyanosis  especially during feedings and bouts of crying. They also report AV synchronization disruptions in the form of fast heart rates.  Medical History: Preterm birth at 35 weeks. There is a noteworthy family history of congenital heart abnormalities on the female lineage with no history of metabolic disorders  immune disorders  or genetic abnormalities.  Current Clinical Presentation: Upon physical examination  the patient showed signs of dyspnea  cyanosis  and poor weight gain. A murmur was identified on auscultation. Basic pediatric evaluation indicated slower than normal growth rate for her age. Furthermore  orthopnea was noted during crying and feeding. Lung and respiratory examination gave significant findings for underdeveloped lung sounds  indicating possible pulmonary issues.  Conclusion: Clinical presentation of cyanosis  dyspnea  abnormal heart sounds  and a familial history of heart abnormalities raise suspicion for congenital heart disease. Further diagnostic testing is necessary to identify the specific type and severity of the heart defect. 
13,5,71,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial71,Patient Information: A 2-year-old Caucasian male   Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot at birth. His prenatal ultrasound scans revealed a congenital heart defect. He was also noted to have a single umbilical artery and facial dysmorphism. He has a documented family history of congenital heart disorders.  Presenting Complaint: The mother reports that the child has been easily fatigued and irritable recently. She has noticed a substantial decrease in her son's daily activity levels. Besides  she has observed changes in the child's skin color with a bluish tinge  more noticeably around the lips  especially after simple tasks like feeding. Mother also reported episodes of deep blue skin coloration which lasted for some minutes.  Examination: On examination  the child measures below the 3rd percentile for both height and weight for his age. Cyanosis is evident on the lips and fingertips. Heart auscultation reveals a harsh systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border.  Summary: This is a 2-year-old boy with Tetralogy of Fallot  showing symptoms of fatigue  irritability  reduced activity  and cyanosis  which likely indicate decrease in oxygen level due to his congenital heart disease. Signs of developmental delay are also present  possibly associated with his chronic health conditions.
13,5,72,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial72,Patient is a 6-month-old Hispanic female  born full term with no complications  who presents with frequent episodes of breathlessness and failure to gain weight.

The parents note she frequently has difficulty feeding  appearing to tire and becoming sweaty during bottle feeding. She breaths rapidly and her cry is much weaker than that of other babies they've observed. Additionally  she has not been gaining weight at a typical rate  based on pediatrician-provided growth charts. No fevers  vomiting or diarrhea reported. On examination  there is mild cyanosis especially on her lips  a low-grade systolic murmur is heard  and she has poor weight gain with mild hypotonia.  Working Diagnosis:  The presenting symptoms and the established genetic syndrome suggest that the infant likely has underlying congenital heart disease  possibly Interrupted Aortic Arch or other conotruncal cardiac defect associated with DiGeorge Syndrome. Further cardiological evaluation and imaging is warranted.
13,5,80,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial80,Problem Representation:  Patient: A 4-month-old male infant  born full-term following an uncomplicated pregnancy to a 28-year-old  healthy mother.  Background: No previous medical history. Patient born via C-section  negative for maternal diabetes  maternal drug use  or HIV exposure.  Vaccinations up to date.  Presenting Complaint: The baby was brought to the pediatric outpatient clinic by the mother who was concerned about the baby's constant fatigue  noticeable paleness  and poor feeding.  Symptoms: The baby has been increasingly irritable and tired for the past two weeks. Mother reports difficulty feeding the baby  who seems breathless after a few mouthfuls and rarely finishes a feed. Baby often feels cold to touch and appears notably pale. No known allergies.   Examination: Heart murmur identified during examination. Cyanosis observed after feeding  which subsides at rest. Detailed investigation shows poor weight gain over the past month.  Relevant tests: Confirmation of congenital heart disease through echocardiography  showing an atrial septal defect. Hemoglobin  complete blood count  renal function  hepatic function ordered to look for any related complications.   Working diagnosis: The 4-month-old male infant presented with symptoms indicative of congenital heart disease  specifically an atrial septal defect  confirmed through echocardiogram. Current symptoms include fatigue  poor feeding  and failure to thrive  likely linked to decreased oxygen perfusion due to the heart defect. The plan includes referral for management involving potential surgical intervention  coupled with a comprehensive plan to manage symptoms.
13,5,81,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial81,"Patient: 6-month-old Caucasian male infant  Chief Complaint: """"Baby has difficulty feeding and is less active""""  Past Medical History: Born full-term via spontaneous vaginal delivery with no complications reported during prenatal and postnatal periods. No history of any major illnesses.  Family History: Father has a history of unspecified congenital heart disease. No history of cardiovascular diseases in immediate family members.  Present Illness: On presentation  mother reported that the baby has difficulty suckling and takes longer to finish feeding. She also noted a decrease in his activity level and occasional rapid breathing  more pronounced after feeds. No episodes of cyanosis reported. Over the past two weeks  the infant has gained less weight.  Physical Examination: The infant is small for his age. Upon examination  central cyanosis was noted. A grade 3/6 pansystolic murmur was heard best at the left lower sternal border. Pulses were full and equal bilaterally.  Impression: Clinical features are suggestive of congenital heart disease  possibly a ventricular septal defect owing to the mid-systolic murmur and the infant's failure to thrive. This diagnosis accounts for presenting symptoms and is also genetically plausible given the father's medical history. Further workup needs to be initiated to confirm the diagnosis and guide the course of treatment."
13,5,82,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial82,Demographics: An eight-month-old Hispanic girl is presented.  Medical History: She was born at term without complications. However  she did not thrive as expected for her age; instead  she showed retarded growth. Her parents also report that she gets tired and breathy easily during breastfeeding. The parents have no significant family history of congenital heart disease.  Symptoms on Presentation: The physical examination reveals a failure to thrive  a low weight for her age and height  cyanotic lips  and a finger-clubbing feature. She exhibits signs of difficulty in breathing  such as flaring nostrils and in-drawing lower ribs. Auscultation of the heart reveals a continuous murmur  and a decrease in air entry is observed on the left lung base. She also has a low oxygen saturation level of 80% in the resting state.
13,5,83,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial83,Patient Presentation: A six-month-old male infant  full-term  third child of non-consanguineous parents  presents to the pediatric outpatient department with complaints of poor weight gain  exhaustion during feeding  and increased frequency of respiratory infections since birth.   Medical history: The patient’s prenatal history is unremarkable. Mother had regular antenatal checkups and ultrasound examinations  which did not reveal any abnormalities. There was no history of maternal diabetes  infections during pregnancy  or exposure to drugs or toxins. There is no family history of congenital heart disease or other genetic disorders.   Current status: The patient seems underweight for his age (below the 3rd percentile). Physical examination reveals a systolic murmur heard best at the upper left sternal border. There are signs of respiratory distress including subcostal and intercostal retractions  tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 48 breaths per minute  and mild cyanosis of the lips. He is active  alert  and not in acute distress.   Based on his clinical presentation and history  the infant may be suffering from a cyanotic congenital heart disease such as Tetralogy of Fallot or Tricuspid Atresia. The failure to thrive  frequent infections  and cyanosis are suggestive of chronic hypoxia due to the abnormal right to left shunting of blood. Further diagnostic workup is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
13,5,84,diagnosis13-prompt5-trial84,Patient Information: A 5-year-old Caucasian male child  Medical History: Diagnosed with a congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot  at birth. Underwent complete repair with a transannular patch at 1 year of age with no postoperative complications documented. Also has a history of moderate pulmonary valve regurgitation due to the therapy.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient's mother reports that the child is experiencing increasing dyspnea upon exertion  specifically while playing soccer  and occasional complaints of mild chest pain after running. The child also exhibited cyanosis several times without any apparent reason. Additionally  a significant exercise intolerance was reported by the physical education teacher at school.  Clinical Findings: Upon physical examination  the lung fields were clear. There is a palpable thrill at the left upper sternal border with a harsh holosystolic and early diastolic murmur at the same location. The pulses were equal and full in all four extremities. The patient's oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. These findings are indicative of potential stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract or pulmonary valve.

13,6,3,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial3,Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  fatigue  and poor weight gain in a 4-month-old child.  Problem Representation:  The patient is a 4-month-old Caucasian male brought by his parents for a pediatric consultation due to apparent symptoms of shortness of breath  fatigue  and poor weight gain. Comparing current body weight and height with the growth chart illustrated a lag behind the standard percentiles for his age.  Preceding these symptoms  the parents noticed that the child tends to tire easily  sweats heavily during feeding and shows slower growth development compared to other newborns of the same age. They also observed appropriate milestones in cognitive and motor skills  with the infant able to hold his head up independently and attempting to roll over. Despite appropriate appetite and feeding  the poor weight gain and fatigue persisted.  Patient's mother had a normal pregnancy without significant complications. At birth  the baby was full-term and had normal APGAR scores. There were no apparent anomalies or abnormalities found during his initial screening and discharged in well condition.  Family history reveals an open-heart surgery in the child's paternal grandfather due to a congenital heart defect. No other significant genetic or environmental risks  including maternal infection  smoking  alcohol or illicit drug use during pregnancy  were identified.  Immunization is up-to-date  with the child receiving all scheduled vaccinations for his age.  Based on this history coupled with the symptoms and genetic predisposition  there is a high chance of existence of a congenital heart disease such as a septal defect or other forms of abnormal cardiac formation. Further diagnostic tests are necessary  like chest X-ray  EKG  and echocardiography  to confirm the suspected diagnosis.  In this representation  the problem is the combination of symptoms – fatigue  shortness of breath  heavy sweating  and poor weight gain in an infant with a family history of congenital heart disease. These symptoms suggest an underlying condition that is affecting the child's normal growth and development. The most likely diagnosis at this point is some form of congenital heart disease.
13,6,4,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial4,Problem Representation:  Demographic Characterization:  Patient A is a six-month-old female infant  who currently resides in a suburban area. She is of African American ethnicity and was born via a normal spontaneous delivery to a 25-year-old healthy mother. She is fully breastfed and up to date with all her vaccinations. She is the first child and there are no siblings. She has no known drug allergies.  Relevant Past Medical History:  Patient A was taken to the hospital in her third month due to persistent poor feeding  rapid breathing and fatigue during feeding. Upon examination  she was found to have evidence of cardiomegaly (enlarged heart). She was hospitalized and further investigation was done. A thorough examination through echocardiography led to a diagnosis of a congenital heart defect  namely a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). With the guidance of her pediatric cardiologist  she was subjected to medical management focusing on managing her symptoms.   Her mother has reported a couple of times her bluish skin color  especially around her lips and fingernails  when she is crying. Further  her growth has been lagging when compared to normal infants of the same age. Her mother reports no history of alcohol or illicit drug use during pregnancy. She had taken prenatal vitamins and there was no known exposure to toxins or infections during pregnancy. Patient A's parents have no history of congenital heart diseases and no other family history of genetic or hereditary heart disorders.  Her diagnosis at six months shows she is suffering from typical symptoms associated with congenital heart disease  including feeding difficulties  failure to thrive  and episodes of cyanosis.  In addition to her primary diagnosis of VSD  she was also diagnosed with minor pulmonary complications due to the excess pulmonary blood flow secondary to her VSD. She was ensured a close follow-up with her Pediatric Cardiologist to monitor her medically managed condition and to decide when surgical correction of her condition will be performed.

13,6,41,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial41,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: - Age: 2 months old - Gender: Male - Race: Asian - Weight: 4.2 kg - Height: 52 cm  Medical History: The baby was born term (40 weeks) with a birth weight of 3.4 kg. The pregnancy was marked by gestational diabetes and maternal fever second to urinary tract infection during peripartum period. Family history revealed a paternal cousin with an unspecified heart condition. Neonatal period was uneventful until repeated episodes of cyanosis were noticed during breastfeeding. Episodes were characterized by bluish discoloration of lips and extremities  difficulty in breathing and feeding.   Clinical Features: Currently presenting the baby with persistent cyanosis  dysmorphic features including wide-set eyes  a flat facial profile  and respiratory distress. Clinical assessment reveals a systolic murmur  significantly decreased pulmonary ventilation on auscultation of the left lung and visible precordial pulsations. Oxygen saturation in room air is noted to be 87%. Electrocardiogram shows right axis deviation.  Physical Examination: Peripheries were cool with delayed capillary refill time. There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly palpable. Signs of congestive heart failure were absent.  Impression: This is a 2 months old male infant with significant cyanosis  dysmorphic features and systolic murmur  combined with a history of episodes of cyanosis during feeding  suggesting underlying congenital heart disease. The possibility of a cyanotic congenital heart disease  such as Tetralogy of Fallot needs to be considered given the findings  although differential diagnoses include other forms of cyanotic heart diseases.  Proposed Course of Action: A detailed echocardiography is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. Consultation with a paediatric cardiologist for further discussion about the possible medical or surgical treatment options is advised. Genetic consultation may also be beneficial  as certain tetrology of Fallot cases are linked with chromosomal disorders. Regular reviews and follow-up is essential for ongoing management and surveillance of the baby's condition.

13,6,43,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial43,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 6-month-old Hispanic male infant  currently residing in Texas. His parents are non-consanguineous and they have no other children. The father is 30 years old and the mother is 28 years old. The family has a lower-middle socioeconomic status.   Presenting Symptoms:  The patient appears mildly cyanotic  exhibiting noticeable bluish discoloration of his lips  tongue  and extremities. Parents report episodes of excessive rapid breathing and poor feeding. There is a decrease in weight compared to previous records  suggesting a failure to thrive.  Family Medical History:  The baby has a maternal uncle who had a 'hole in the heart'  but details of diagnosis  surgical interventions  or outcomes are unavailable. Both parents are otherwise healthy  with no diagnosed genetic disorders or congenital anomalies.  Personal Medical History: The patient was not diagnosed with any disease at birth. His growth was within normal percentiles until two months of age. After that period  lags in weight gain became noticeable.   Prenatal and Perinatal History: The mother had regular antenatal care with no identified risk factors. The mother denies substance abuse during pregnancy. Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful; birth weight  length  and other vital statistics were within the acceptable range.   Immunization: The infant is up-to-date with his age-appropriate vaccinations.  Physical Examination: The baby appears thin with noticeable pallor. On auscultation  a continuous murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border. Pulse was observed to be weak. The liver was palpable 1 cm below the right costal margin. Other physical findings were unremarkable.   Lab Findings: Pending   A problem list based on the above information would include:  1. Congenital heart disease (suspected) 2. Cyanosis 3. Tachypnea 4. Failure to Thrive 5. Family history of congenital heart disease 6. Mild hepatomegaly.      Further investigations such as chest X-ray  ECG  and Echocardiogram would help confirm the diagnosis of any specific congenital heart diseases like Tetralogy of Fallot  ventricular septal defect  etc.          
13,6,44,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial44,Patient Profile:  Name: Jane Doe Age: 6 months Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Birthweight: 3 kg Current weight: 5 kg Civil Status: Dependent on parents Education: Nil Occupation: Nil  Presenting Problem:  Jane Doe is a 6-month-old baby girl who was referred to the cardiologist by her pediatrician due to suspicion of congenital heart disease. She exhibits symptoms such as rapid breathing  poor weight gain  cyanotic lips  and extreme fatigue.  Past Medical History:  Jane was born full-term via normal vaginal delivery. She had a low birthweight and difficulty with feeding right after birth. Pediatric records indicate that she was diagnosed with failure to thrive at 2 months of age due to slow weight gain. During well-baby visits  her pediatrician noticed she often tires easily during feeding  sweat excessively  and has persistent fast breathing even when at rest. There were also occasional times when her skin and lips were noted to have a bluish shade  particularly when she cries.  Family History:  There is a known history of congenital heart disease on the maternal side of the family. Jane's mother's younger brother had Tetralogy of Fallot and required surgery in early infancy. Her grandmother on the maternal side has a bicuspid aortic valve. There are no known congenital heart disease or other significant medical conditions on the paternal side of the family.  Lifestyle Factors:  Jane is exclusively breastfed and receives routine infant vaccinations. She is often at home and is not exposed to smoke or harmful substances. The household is reported to be well suited for raising an infant  with the required amenities and safety measures.   Observations/Examinations:  On physical examination  Jane's heart rate is notably fast  she breathes rapidly  and her lips and skin appear slightly bluish (cyanotic). Low oxygen saturation levels have been recorded. Upon listening to her chest  a heart murmur is detected. She has a low weight for her age.  Investigations:  Further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis which could include blood tests  echocardiogram  and possibly cardiac catheterization.  Initial Diagnosis:  The presenting symptoms strongly suggest a case of congenital heart disease  but the exact type is yet to be definitively determined. Further investigations are crucial to confirm this.
13,6,45,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial45,Patient Profile:   Name: Little John  Gender: Male  Age: 7 months  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Residence: California  USA   Medical History:   1. Patient diagnosed with cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to poor circulation or insufficient oxygen) during the neonatal period.   2. Persistent feeding difficulties and progressive weight loss in comparison to peers from the 3rd month onwards.   3. Two episodes of respiratory tract infection requiring hospitalization at the 5th month.   4. Regular follow-up with pediatrician since birth for routine vaccination and growth monitoring.   5. No other known congenital anomalies or genetic disorders.   Family History:   1. No reported history of congenital heart disease or other genetic disorders from both paternal and maternal lineage.   2. One older sibling who is healthy and has normal growth and development.   3. Parents and grandparents are alive and reportedly healthy  with no history of heart disease.   Clinical Findings:   On examination  the child appears undernourished and has obvious cyanosis. He is tachypnoeic (abnormally rapid breathing) and has clubbing (enlargement or rounding of fingers and toes often associated with long-term oxygen deprivation). Grade 3/6 ejection systolic murmur (irregular heartbeat sound) can be heard in the upper left sternal border. Saturation of oxygen is 85% in room air.   Diagnosis:   Based on clinical examination and echocardiogram findings  Little John is diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  which is a congenital heart disease. Further genetic evaluation is recommended due to the unknown cause of this condition.   Treatment and Management Plan:   The child requires cardiac evaluation and therapeutic interventions. A cardiac catheterization might be recommended prior to the surgical repair. The definitive surgical treatment  intracardiac repair  is performed usually between 6 months and 2 years of age. Long-term follow up is necessary due to possible complications and the need for potential re-interventions.   For the feeding difficulties and failure to thrive  a nutritional evaluation and management plan is also warranted. This likely will include high-calorie formula or breast milk fortifiers  frequent feeding schedules  and potential use of feeding tube until adequate weight gain is achieved.   Given his susceptibility to respiratory infections  vaccination against common viruses and careful monitoring for symptoms of infection are also important. A healthy and germ-free home environment should be maintained.

Socioeconomic status: Middle class  Presenting Problem: Patient X presents with episodes of rapid breathing and fatigue even during feeding. Parents also notice bluish color on his skin  lips  and fingernails especially during these episodes.     Past Medical History:  Prenatal: The mother had regular prenatal checkups. No complications or infections were reported during pregnancy. No history of maternal drug or alcohol abuse. A routine anomaly scan at 20 weeks of gestation suggested possible anomalies in the fetal heart.  Birth: Born full term via normal vaginal delivery with no complications. Birth weight was in the 50th percentile for gestational age.  Neonatal: Initially well  but started showing signs of feeding difficulties and poor weight gain by 1 month.  Immunizations: Up-to-date for age.  Family history: No known genetic diseases or congenital heart defects in immediate or extended family.  Surgical History: No previous surgeries.  Hospitalization History: Admitted once at the age of 3 months due to severe shortness of breath.  Medications: None  Allergies: None known  Developmental milestones: Because of the feeding difficulties and frequent fatigue  the infant's motor skills such as sitting and crawling seem to be slightly delayed.  The working diagnosis based on the history is congenital heart disease  the cause of which needs to be determined through further diagnostic procedures.

Physical Examination:  On examination  Emily Jones is alert and calm but has a noticeable pallor and jaundice. She has normal respiratory rate for her age  however on auscultation  a significant heart murmur was detected. Hepatomegaly is palpable under the ribs  but the lungs are clear.   Possible Diagnosis:  Based on presenting symptoms and physical examination pointing to heart abnormality  Emily might be having a congenital heart disease such as patent ductus arteriosus  ventricular septal defect  or atrial septal defect. Further diagnostic investigations like echocardiogram and ECG are required to confirm the diagnosis.  Summary:  Emily Jones is a 5-day old mixed-ethnicity female infant presented with feeding problems  neonatal jaundice  and profuse sweating during eating. She has an abnormal heart murmur and hepatomegaly  indicating a possible congenital heart disease diagnosis. Further diagnostic workup is required to confirm this suspicion."
13,6,48,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial48,Patient Profile:   Name: Baby John Doe  Age: 6 months  Gender: Male  Ethnicity: African American  Place of residence: Houston  Texas  Problem Representation:  Baby John Doe  a 6-month-old male infant of African American ethnicity  is currently residing in Houston  Texas. His parents have identified noticeable cyanosis and observed that John Doe presents difficulty in feeding and excessive sweating. He also shows signs of shortness of breath and appears to growth failure when compared to other children of his age.   Past Medical History:  Baby John Doe was born full-term with a birth weight of 3 kg. His prenatal history was uneventful  and he was delivered via normal vaginal delivery. There were no immediate postnatal complications  and he was discharged home with his mother in a stable condition.  However  within the first week at home  his parents noticed that he became quite distressed while feeding  showing signs of sweating and difficulty in breathing. He was less active and alert compared to at birth and was not gaining weight efficiently. He was subsequently hospitalized for a detailed assessment  during which a heart murmur was detected. He underwent diagnostic procedures  including Echocardiography and Electrocardiogram.  The echocardiogram revealed some congenital heart defects  including Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed right ventricular hypertrophy and right atrium enlargement - all characteristics consistent with his diagnosis of TOF.  Given his declining condition and confirmed diagnosis of congenital heart disease  baby John Doe is likely to need further ongoing care and potentially surgical intervention to correct the defects. He is currently prescribed medications to manage his symptoms  including Digoxin and Diuretics.   Family History:  There is a cousin on his mother's side who was also diagnosed with a congenital heart disease. However  both his parents have no known health conditions.  Social History:  Baby John Doe lives with both parents who are employed full time. The family has health insurance that can cover the majority of his medical expenses. No reported exposure to smoke  alcohol  or illicit substances.

Notes on Risk Factors: Patient has a higher risk for developing arrhythmias  endocarditis  and may need further medical follow-ups or surgical interventions in the future due to consequences of the initial repair.
13,6,50,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial50,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Age: 3 months old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Address: 123 Main Street  Anytown  Anywhere Culture/Religion: Christian  Presentation:  John Doe has been brought in by his parents due to concern over his persistent fatigue and difficulty feeding. He was observed to be tiring easily after feeding  with episodes of cyanosis  especially during crying or feeding.   Demographics:  John Doe was born full term via normal spontaneous delivery with no reported complications during pregnancy or delivery. He's been exclusively breastfed. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is the first child in the family. His growth milestones appear to be slightly delayed according to his two-month checkup records. His mother  aged 35  had regular prenatal care and has no significant medical history.  Family Medical History:  Both parents are healthy with no reported heart disease  hypertension or diabetes. There is no known family history of congenital heart disease  genetic disorders  or chromosomal abnormalities.  Medical History:  John was noted to have a heart murmur on his two-month checkup. Due to this and his symptoms of fatigue and cyanosis  it's suspected that he may have a possible congenital cardiac anomaly. No other anomalies were detected in post-natal and neonatal period. He has not been hospitalized or undergone any surgery. He has no known drug allergies.  Summary:  The profile represents a 3-month-old male infant suspected of harboring a congenital heart condition  based on his persistent fatigue  difficulty feeding  episodes of cyanosis  and detected heart murmur. Further diagnostic tests and evaluation are required to confirm the type and severity of the condition if present  and formulate an appropriate treatment plan. The lack of family history of heart conditions might hint on a non-hereditary congenital heart condition. However  complete genealogical and chromosomal studies may be necessary to establish the exact genesis and implications for lifetime management and prognosis.
13,6,51,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial51,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 6-month-old female presenting with symptoms indicative of congenic heart disease. Her name is Emma Thompson. She was born full term with no evident complications during her mother's pregnancy. However  although her parents are non-consanguineous  they have a family history of congenital heart diseases on her mother's side. Her growth and development have been within normal limits apart from a lack of weight gain over the past month.   Presenting Concern: Emma's parents have noticed she has a faster breathing rate  poor feeding  and less frequent bowel movements. In addition  she appears to have difficulty gaining weight despite increased feeding attempts. Emma's primary pediatrician  upon examination  also noted a slight bluish discoloration around her mouth and on her fingers and toes (cyanosis)  as well as a soft heart murmur.   Past Medical History: Apart from her current symptoms  Emma has been generally healthy since birth  with all immunizations up-to-date. She had a brief admission for jaundice just after birth  but no complications since then. She has not had any surgeries or significant illnesses.   Family Medical History:  Emma's maternal uncle underwent surgery at age 1 for a congenital heart defect  Tetralogy of Fallot. Her mother's cousin  also had surgery in early childhood for a Ventricular Septal Defect. Her paternal family history is reportedly free of cardiovascular diseases.   Social History: Emma's parents are non-smokers and her home environment is safe  clean  and nurturing.   Problem Representation Summary: A 6-month-old female with a family history of congenital heart disease presenting with symptoms such as faster breathing rate  poor feeding  cyanosis  reduced bowel movements  and failure to gain weight over the past month despite increased feeding attempts. Potential congenital heart disease is suspected due to her symptoms and the findings of the physical exam.

Mother: Has hypothyroidism.  No familial history of heart diseases.  Medical History:  Born full term via vaginal delivery. No complications during birth. Exclusively breastfed for 6 months  currently on mixed feed. Had routine newborn screening and vaccinations. A heart murmur was noted at birth and the baby was referred to a cardiologist. The echocardiogram showed Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).  No pathological jaundice experienced. No significant history of infections or use of medications.   Current Problem:  The baby presents with cyanotic episodes  especially while crying or feeding (so-called """"tet spells""""). There is a delay in weight gain as compared to his age.   Physical Examination:  Upon physical examination  baby appears slightly cyanotic  particularly the lips and fingertips. He displays signs of respiratory distress. A heart murmur is noted.  Diagnostic Findings:  Echocardiogram: Confirms the presence of TOF with ventricular septal defect  pulmonary valve stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta.  ECG: Demonstrates right ventricle hypertrophy.  Chest X-Ray: Boot-shaped heart.  Clinical Manifestation:  The patient’s clinical manifestations include cyanotic episodes  delayed growth  and dyspnea on exertion. The presence of the heart murmur raises suspicion for a congenital heart disease which was confirmed by the echocardiogram showing TOF.   Plan of Care:  An expert pediatric cardiologist will create a plan of multidisciplinary care  which will typically include palliative surgery followed by corrective surgery at a later age. Potentially  the need for long-term follow-up to monitor for complications and manage associated conditions such as arrhythmias  pulmonary regurgitations  or residual ventricular septal defects. Psychological support for the family will also be provided.   NB: This is a fictional case scenario and any resemblance to real life scenarios is purely coincidental.

She was presented with common symptoms like tiring easily during feeding  rapid breathing  shortness of breath  edema (swelling) in the legs  abdomen  and areas around the eyes  and has a blue color to the skin  lips  and fingernails (cyanosis).  Past Medical History:   Maria was born full term with a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. However  she was diagnosed with a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) at birth which went undetected during antenatal scans. She had a low birth weight of 2500 grams and had to spend a week in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to respiratory difficulties.  After being discharged  Maria thrived for a few months but started showing symptoms of fatigue  poor growth  and a heart murmur was detected during a routine check-up at about four months of age. The pediatrician referred her to the pediatric cardiologist for further evaluation  where she was initially diagnosed with a VSD.  Family History:   There is no known family history of congenital heart disease. However  Maria's mother  aged 29  has Type II Diabetes and her father  aged 33  has a history of hypertension and is an occasional smoker. Maria is the second child  with a healthy 4-year-old brother.  Recent Laboratory Findings:  Two-dimensional Echocardiography/Echo-Doppler and color flow imaging have confirmed the VSD diagnosis. Routine laboratory tests including blood tests  chest X-ray  and EKG have been completed  the results of which were fairly normal but showed signs consistent with CHD.   Maria’s oxygen saturation levels  however  are intermittently below normal  indicating that she is not getting enough oxygen due to the VSD.   Future Management Plan:  The Pediatric Cardiologist recommends Maria for a cardiac catheterization to have a clear image of how blood flows in and out of the heart  which should provide detailed diagnostics. Surgical repair of the defect would be considered based on the severity and location of it. Maria's developmental progress and growth will be closely monitored. Management will involve a multidisciplinary approach with regular follow-ups.  The parents are counseled on the potential risks and complications. They are recommended to give her a balanced diet enriched with essential nutrients for her physical growth and early initiation of therapies if required  to help Maria meet development milestones as much as possible.
13,6,61,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial61,Patient Problem Representation:  A two-month-old female infant of Hispanic ethnicity referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further management and assessment of congenital heart disease detected on routine neonatal screening. The infant was born through a normal vaginal delivery and has no known exposure to toxins or environmental risk factors. However  she has been irritable and has shown feeding difficulties including poor intake and frequent spitting or vomiting after feeding. There has also been noticeable weight loss since birth and the pediatrician noted cyanosis in the lips and nail beds during the last check-up.  The family history is significant as her mother had a miscarriage three years ago and the family has a history of congenital heart diseases  with a maternal uncle having passed away from complications related to an undiagnosed congenital heart defect in early childhood. The infant's mother also has Type 2 Diabetes. The infant does not have any known drug allergies but is on a prescribed multivitamin supplement.   Further diagnostic testing  including echocardiograms  is pending to confirm the diagnosis and understand the extent of the problem. Given the complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors along with the family history of congenital heart disease  this patient is at a higher risk for congenital heart defects and subsequent complications. Implications of the diagnosis and potential treatment options will depend on the specific type of defect identified. Issues may include impact on growth and development  risk of infective endocarditis  and risk of premature death. Active and timely treatment is crucial for survival and to enhance the quality of life.

Past Medical History:  Prenatal: Mother reported uneventful pregnancy and opted for minimal prenatal testing  except for regular ultrasound tests. No congenital anomalies were reported. Mother had adequate prenatal care and reported no use of tobacco  alcohol  or illegal drugs during pregnancy.  Perinatal: Baby John was born full term via normal vaginal delivery. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at one and five minutes  respectively. Birth weight was lower than average (2.3kgs)  but baby did not require any immediate medical intervention.  Postnatal: Baby John had normal development milestones for the first month. However  the pediatrician noted failure to thrive from the 2nd month onward  as the baby was not gaining weight as expected. John also experienced repeated episodes of breathlessness after feeding and excessive sweating. No history of cyanotic attacks.  Hospitalizations: Baby John was admitted to the hospital at 4 months due to severe breathlessness and diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection.   Presenting Complaints:  Mother reports that John appears increasingly lethargic  has difficulty in feeding  and sweats excessively. She also noticed that John's skin and lips often take on a bluish hue  especially after crying or feeding.   Medical assessments to date:  Physical examination: On examination  the baby is found to be cyanotic. Other signs include mild chest deformity  lower limb coolness  decreased peripheral pulses  and a heart murmur.  Diagnostic investigations: Based on these symptoms  the pediatrician ordered further diagnostic tests. A chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly (enlarged heart) and increased pulmonary vascular markings. An Echocardiography confirmed the presence of a congenital heart defect - Tetralogy of Fallot  which includes a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)  overriding aorta  pulmonary stenosis  and right ventricular hypertrophy.   Treatment to date:  Baby John has been on medication for heart failure management  including Diuretics and Digoxin. The Pediatric Cardiology team is discussing the optimal timing for corrective surgery.   Psychosocial History:  Parents are understandably anxious about John's health and progress.

13,6,85,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial85,Problem Representation:  Demographic information: Patient X is an eight-month-old Asian male. He is the first child of non-consanguineous parents with no known family history of congenital heart disease or other genetic disorders. His prenatal period was uneventful  with normal prenatal screening results.  Present medical history: Patient X has been experiencing recurrent episodes of breathing difficulty  poor feeding  failure to thrive  and excessive sweating since he was four months old. He has a history of multiple hospital admissions due to respiratory infections.   Past medical history: At birth  he was a full-term baby with normal Apgar scores. He was breastfed and his early development milestones were appropriate for his age until the age of four months when he started showing the above-mentioned symptoms.  Examination findings: Physical examination revealed the patient to be small for his age  cyanotic  and breathless with minimal exertion. Chest auscultation found an S2 heart sound splitting along with a systolic ejection murmur.   Hospitalization history: He had three hospital admissions in the past four months due to severe respiratory distress  each requiring a prolonged stay of at least a week. All the infections were treated accordingly with antibiotics.  Conclusion: Altogether  the recurrent respiratory infections  failure to thrive  poor feeding  and the abnormal heart sounds suggest a likely diagnosis of congenital heart disease. Further diagnostic investigations are needed to confirm the type of congenital heart disease and discuss appropriate treatment options.

13,6,89,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial89,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:   The patient is a three-month-old Caucasian female infant.   Demographics:  She is the first child of non-consanguineous parents  born at full term after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Her parents are young  both in their early-30s  and healthy  with no history of chronic illnesses or genetic conditions. There is no family history of congenital heart disease or any other birth defects.  Chief Complaint:  The infant presents with poor weight gain  less frequent and shortened feeding times  excessive sweating especially during nipple feedings  rapid breathing  and increasingly frequent respiratory infections.   Past Medical History:  The infant received all standard newborn screenings and vaccinations at birth as per recommended pediatric guidelines. There were no abnormal neonatal screening results. Her birth weight  length  and head circumference were within normal ranges. However  subsequent visits have seen a decreased rate in growth and weight gain. Heart murmur was noted at her 1-month checkup.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  the infant showed signs of respiratory distress  tachypnea  and visible sweating. She also showed signs of poor peripheral circulation such as cyanosis/ bluish tint of the skin  and there was also a presence of lower limb edema. Cardiovascular examination revealed a loud systolic murmur.  Suspected Diagnosis: Based on the mentioned symptoms and findings  the leading suspected diagnosis is a congenital heart disease.  Special Consideration: The requires comprehensive cardiac evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and to ascertain complexity and severity  which can include echocardiography  chest X-ray  and/or cardiac catheterization. Close monitoring of her growth and development is essential to identify any complications or issues early and manage them promptly.

13,6,91,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial91,Patient Problem Representation:  A 2-year-old Hispanic female  accompanied by her parents  presents with worsening pallor  shortness of breath  and poor feeding over the last month. Her parents also note frequent episodes of rapid heartbeats and sweating especially during meals. The girl was diagnosed with a congenital heart disease known as Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) three months after birth at a well-baby visit. She was born at full term following an uncomplicated pregnancy. The family history is significant on the mother's side  with a maternal uncle who was diagnosed with early childhood heart disease but the specific type is unknown.  The girl's development milestones are reportedly on schedule  except for weight gain which has been slow since birth. She is up to date on immunizations and has no known drug allergies. She had a common cold about two weeks ago which has subsided.  She is currently on Enalapril (0.5 mg/kg  twice daily) and Lasix (1 mg/kg  once daily) prescribed after the VSD diagnosis. Despite medication  her symptoms have progressively worsened.  Physical examination reveals a failure to thrive with a weight below the 5th percentile for her age. She is afebrile with a regular heart rate of 130 bpm  and her respiratory rate is slightly elevated. There is evidence of poor peripheral perfusion with cold extremities. Auscultation reveals a pansystolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border.  Essentially  we are presented with a baby girl  diagnosed with Congenital Heart Disease (Ventricular Septal Defect)  who despite being on heart failure medication is showing signs of progressive worsening.

Presenting Problem: - Patient has been experiencing rapid breathing  poor weight gain  and has periods of 'blue skin' episodes signifying inadequate oxygenation. These symptoms have been progressive since birth.  Past Medical History: - Prenatal: Patient was delivered at 38 weeks via a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery  with a birth weight of 2.7 kg. Mother reported reduced movements during the third trimester. - Neonatal: Patient required oxygen support shortly after birth due to cyanosis. - Post-neonatal: The patient has been receiving regular infant immunizations but has been recurrently hospitalized for respiratory infections. Regular diet but poor weight gain. - Surgical history: None at present.  Relevant Past Medical Tests: - Echocardiogram at 2 months showed severe congenital heart disease. Further cardiac imagining indicates Tetralogy of Fallot  with an overriding aorta  ventricular septal defect  right ventricular outflow tract obstruction  and right ventricular hypertrophy.  Summary:  Our patient is a 2-year-old Hispanic female with a confirmed diagnosis of congenital heart disease  more specifically Tetralogy of Fallot. Her presenting issues include difficulty breathing  poor weight gain  and cyanotic episodes. Her symptoms coupled with her positive medical tests make her a high-risk pediatric patient needing longitudinal cardiac care. Considering her mother's exposure to teratogens during pregnancy  further genetic investigation might be needed.
13,6,98,diagnosis13-prompt6-trial98,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  Identity: Male infant aged 6 months old. First born of a non-consanguineous married couple  residing in an urban setting. Father is a software engineer and Mother is a homemaker.  Demographics: Hispanic  Median income household. Parents are non-smokers  no known exposure to harmful radiation or toxins around the mother during pregnancy or post-birth.  Presenting Complaint: Recurrent episodes of breathlessness and inadequate weight gain. The child appears generally unwell.  Past Medical History: The obstetric history is unremarkable. Pregnancy and delivery were both uneventful. The child was born at term with APGAR scores of 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Postnatal period was uneventful with normal feeding  sleeping  and excretion habits. Immunizations are up to date as per the schedule.   Family History: No known genetic disorders or congenital heart defects in the family. No sudden deaths in the young in either maternal or paternal family.  Clinical Examination: On examination  the infant is small for age. Signs of labored breathing are seen. The skin is pale  but no cyanosis. Auscultation reveals abnormal heart sounds with murmurs.   Likely Diagnoses: The symptoms and signs point towards a possible congenital cardiac condition. The difficulty in breathing and failure to thrive are common presentations in pediatric heart disease. The abnormal heart sounds indicate structural heart defects.  Plan: An echocardiogram is planned to investigate for structural cardiac disorders. Further genetic testing may be indicated based on clinical suspicion if any syndromic condition is suspected. Consultation with a pediatric cardiologist for further management is advised.    This problem representation aids in forming the hypothesis of congenital heart disease in this infant. However  further investigative tests will confirm the diagnosis and help chalk out a detailed management plan.

13,7,1,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial1,Case Report: Congenital Heart Disease in a 6-Year-Old Female of Hispanic Heritage  Patient Information:  The patient is a 6-year-old female of Hispanic origin. The child resides in a suburban area in southern California where she was brought to the local hospital by her parents due to regular episodes of fatigue and occasional shortness of breath  both of which were reported to have increased recently in frequency and severity. The child was an only child with a birth weight of 3.6 Kg with no reported history of neonatal asphyxia  neonatal infection  or neonatal icterus.  Clinical Findings:  Upon consultation  the pediatric cardiologist noted cyanosis and puffiness around the eyes. The physical examination revealed a decrease in lower limb pulses and the presence of a grade III/VI pansystolic murmur. A chest X-ray indicated the presence of cardiomegaly. Additionally  an electrocardiogram showed right ventricular hypertrophy  and echocardiography showed a large ventricular septal defect (VSD). The collected data led to the preliminary diagnosis of Eisenmenger syndrome  a type of congenital heart disease.  Past Medical History:  The patient was born at a local hospital with a gestational period of 39 weeks. The mother had a healthy pregnancy  and no complications were reported during the delivery. Both parents were generally healthy with no identified genetic syndromes  no history of congenital heart disease  and no heart disease history in their extended families. The child reached her development milestones normally for her age  with no previous hospitalized events recorded until this current issue. There is no history of smoking  alcohol  or drug use in the immediate family.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  A study of blood gas levels revealed below-normal oxygen saturation  a condition known as hypoxemia. Her hematocrit was elevated  suggesting that the body was producing more red blood cells to compensate for the low oxygen levels  a condition known as polycythemia. This combination of findings can signal Eisenmenger syndrome  where a large heart defect causes oxygen-poor blood to flow into the oxygen-rich blood and out to the body.   The patient’s ventricular septal defect was confirmed during a cardiac catheterization procedure. The cardiologist decided that any surgical intervention at this point may be risky  given the advanced state of the disease.   Therapeutic Focus and Assessment:  Initial treatments primarily focused on keeping the patient stable and comfortable. Medications to regulate the blood pressure  manage the symptoms of heart failure and prevent blood clots were administered. Due to the present complexities and complications of Eisenmenger Syndrome  a multidisciplinary team including a cardiologist  hematologist  and a pulmonologist was involved in her care.   Patient’s parents were thoroughly educated about the condition and a family-centered care plan was made  keeping in consideration all the social  psychological  and medical needs.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  The patient's condition is currently under control  with regular check-ups scheduled every 3 months. Future management options  such as lung and/or heart transplant  will be considered depending on how the disease progresses.  Informed Patient Consent - Obtained   This case report provides an insight into the complexities and appropriate management for a child suffering from congenital heart disease  and specifically Eisenmenger syndrome. 
13,7,2,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial2,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  I. Demographic Information   The patient is a 22-year-old Caucasian male  currently studying and living in New York City. He is a lifetime non-smoker and consumes alcohol socially. He admits to having an active lifestyle  playing soccer and basketball with his peers every weekend. He denies drug usage. His family history reveals his father has hypertension but there is no familial history of cardiovascular diseases.   II. Chief Complaint   The patient presented himself at the clinic with complaints of fatigue and shortness of breath  primarily on exertion. He also recounted multiple episodes of fainting  noticed in the preceding six months.   III. Past Medical History   His prenatal and perinatal history was unremarkable. Born at term  there were no complications in delivery and he had normal developmental milestones. He had mandatory school health checks that indicated nothing significant. Additionally  he had chickenpox at six years of age and an appendectomy at fourteen.  In high school  he was engaged in sport activities and swimming  but he started finding difficulties recently to catch his breath during and after physical activity. He was initially evaluated by his university's health service  where a murmur was detected on a general physical examination.  IV. Current Examination Findings   On physical examination  the patient was alert and oriented. His body mass index was within the normal range. Cardiac auscultation revealed a systolic heart murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border. Other systemic examinations were normal  with no cyanosis  clubbing  or peripheral edemas.   V. Investigations  An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed right ventricular hypertrophy and a chest X-ray displayed cardiomegaly. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large perimembranous Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) with a left-to-right shunt and moderate pulmonary hypertension.  VI. Diagnosis  The patient was consequently diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CHD) - specifically  a large  unrepaired Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD).   VII. Treatment and Progress  The patient was referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and treatment planning. Symptomatic medication was initiated with beta blocker (Metoprolol) and diuretic (Furosemide). He was advised to modify his lifestyle with low-intensity exercises  a balanced diet  and periodic medical follow-ups.  Patient is currently under evaluation regarding the possibility of surgical repair of the VSD. His medical management plan is being designed with a multidisciplinary team approach involving cardiology  cardiac surgery  and medical therapy.

It underscores the importance of clinical suspicion  examination  and investigation in early diagnosis and management of such cases.
13,7,3,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial3,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Information:  The patient is a six-month-old male  of South Asian ethnicity  born and presently being raised in New York. He is the firstborn with non-consanguineous parents who are both healthy. There is no known family history of congenital heart diseases. The child was born full term via normal spontaneous delivery without significant perinatal events.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient was initially brought by his parents for routine pediatric follow-up but then complained of difficulty in feeding  excessive sweating  and lethargy. There was no history of respiratory issues  cyanosis  or fainting episodes.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed tachycardia with a heart rate of 160 beats per minute. The baby showed signs of poor weight gain. Auscultation of the heart revealed a loud  harsh pansystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border. No cyanosis was observed  but intermediate pulses were noted.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Based on physical findings and presenting complaints  the infant was subjected to numerous diagnostic procedures including EKG  echocardiogram  chest X-ray  arterial blood gas (ABG) assessment  and cardiac catheterization. The EKG showed right ventricular hypertrophy while the echocardiogram demonstrated a large ventricular septal defect causing a significant left-to-right shunt  pulmonary hypertension  and an enlarged right ventricle. The chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly. The ABG showed mild hypoxia and acidosis likely secondary to pulmonary hypertension and poor cardiac output.   Therapeutic Intervention:  After consultation with the cardiology team  pharmacological treatment was initiated to improve his heart functionality and gain some time to optimize his condition for surgery. He was started on Digoxin for increased cardiac output  Diuretics for pulmonary congestion  and ACE inhibitors for afterload reduction. Nutritional therapy included high-calorie diet to facilitate weight gain.  Follow Up and Outcome:  Despite the initial pharmacotherapy  the patient's symptoms did not significantly improve over the course of 3 weeks. Considering his failing health status  the cardiothoracic team decided to proceed with surgical intervention. A successful repair of the ventricular septal defect was performed and post-operative recovery was uneventful. As of his most recent follow-up (3 weeks post-op)  the patient has made substantial progress  is showing noticeable weight gain  diminished symptoms  and improved vitals.  Patien Perspective:  Due to the young age of the patient  his parents are the main source of information concerning his condition. They have expressed gratitude for the care team and satisfaction with the progress following the surgical intervention. They continue to be anxious about the child's future health status.  Informed Consent:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient's parents for publication of this case report.  Takeaway:  This case illustrates the importance of timely diagnosis and intervention in cases of congenital heart disease to prevent severe complications. Heart murmurs in infants should be taken seriously  and if persistent  require further investigation with echocardiography. Nutritional therapy is also important to help these children gain weight and increase their chances of successful surgery and recovery.
13,7,4,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial4,Title: Congenital Heart Disease in an Adolescent Male: A Case Report  Introduction  This case report describes a 15-year-old male patient  of African American ethnicity  diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CHD).   Case Presentation  The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of chest pain  breathlessness  palpitations  and cyanosis  persisting for the past few weeks. He lives in the urban area of Detroit  Michigan  with a low-income single-parent family setup. His family history suggests that his maternal grandfather had a similar heart condition  which suggests a possible genetic predisposition.   Medical History  The patient had a history of repeated hospitalizations from a very young age due to recurring respiratory infections and a failure to thrive  despite adequate nutritional intake. He was diagnosed with CHD at 6 months of age. The specific form of CHD was Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  comprised of the four cardinal features: ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and overriding of the aorta.  Discussion  The patient had a delayed diagnosis due to socioeconomic factors and limited access to health services. Over the years  the severity of his symptoms increased and included shortness of breath  and incidents of unconsciousness. On physical examination in the ED  clubbing of fingers and toes was observed  indicative of chronic hypoxia. Diagnostic modalities such as chest X-ray and Echocardiography results confirmed the diagnosis of TOF.  He was managed medically with beta-blockers  diuretics  and prophylactic antibiotics to control his heart rate  ameliorate fluid retention  and prevent respiratory infections respectively. Considering the increasing severity of the symptoms  surgical intervention – intracardiac repair procedure  was recommended.  Summary    This case report underlines the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment in congenital heart disease. Despite the guarded prognosis  the patient showed resilience  and surgical intervention offered a ray of hope. Taking into account the familial incidence of CHD  genetic counseling for the family was recommended.  This report aims to shed light on the struggles of vulnerable populations in accessing quality healthcare  the need for early diagnosis  and prompt treatment of congenital heart diseases to prevent life-threatening complications and improve the quality of life.
13,7,5,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial5,Case Report - Congital Heart Disease  Patient Profile: The patient is a 2-year old Caucasian female from Phoenix  Arizona. The patient's parents have a non-consanguineous relationship and there is no family history of congenital heart disease. The patient is up-to-date with her vaccinations and has no known allergies. She has had episodic breathlessness and fatigue since birth. She has been breastfed for 12 months with no complementary feeding.  Clinical Presentations: The patient was delivered at full term via C-section with a birth weight of 3.2 kg. She was presented to the pediatrician at about six weeks of age for her initial well-child visit. At the initial presentation  the patient exhibited signs of decreased blood flow with symptoms of frequent breathlessness  fatigue  and a mild bluish discoloration of her skin (cyanosis). She had poor feeding habits and was growing slowly. A physical examination revealed a cardiac murmur.  The patient's pediatrician raised concerns about a possible heart problem and promptly referred the child for further evaluation. Cardiological investigations including electrocardiogram (ECG) and transthoracic echocardiogram were carried out  which revealed a large secundum atrial septal defect and a moderate patent ductus arteriosus.  Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history remained unremarkable till the age of six weeks  after which she started showing signs of heart disease. She does not have any other known medical conditions. There is no history of recurrent RTIs. She had no prior hospital admissions or surgical interventions till the date of reporting.  Treatment  Progress  and Follow-Up: The patient was referred to a pediatric cardiovascular surgeon for surgical correction. Subsequently  she underwent successful closure of the atrial septal defect and ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus.  Postoperative course was uneventful with significant clinical improvement - the bluish discoloration of the skin faded and the frequency of breathlessness reduced notably. Her feeding and growth improved rapidly post-surgery. She has been kept under regular follow-ups with the pediatric cardiologist at 3-month intervals. She is advised to continue routine childhood vaccinations in consultation with the pediatrician.  In conclusion  a congenital heart defect should be considered in infants with poor feeding  poor growth  breathlessness  and bluish skin. Delay in diagnosis and management might lead to serious consequences including failure to thrive and death. Parents need education and psychological support to ensure long term compliance with treatment and follow-up visits.

13,7,7,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial7,Title: A Rare Case of Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Transposition of the Great Arteries in a Male Infant: A Case Report.  Patient Details: The patient is a six-month-old  Caucasian male with congenic heart disease. He was born through normal vaginal delivery and full term. The present report will focus on the medical symptoms  diagnostic procedures  and the management process of congenital heart disease in this patient.  Medical and Family History: The patient was diagnosed with Down syndrome at birth  an autosomal syndrome known to be associated with congenital heart diseases in up to 50% of cases  followed by minor symptoms such as fatigue  fast breathing and feeding difficulties. His family history revealed no instances of congenital heart disease or similar conditions  suggesting a sporadic  non-heritable occurrence of the condition in the patient.  Clinical Findings:  Upon general physical examination  the infant exhibited features consistent with Down syndrome  including flattened facial features  slightly tilted ears  and a protruding tongue. Auscultation of the chest revealed a loud systolic murmur. Key symptoms such as lethargy  poor feeding  and abnormal rapid breathing were evident.  Diagnostic Assessment: An echocardiogram was performed which revealed a double outlet right ventricle (DORV) with transposition of the great arteries (TGA)  a relatively rare form of congenital heart disease.   Interventions: Following the diagnosis  surgical intervention was promptly initiated. A successful arterial switch operation was performed  which was complemented with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) patch closure.   Follow up and outcome: Post-surgery  the baby was thoroughly monitored in the cardiac intensive care unit. Treating team implemented physical therapy sessions to expedite rehabilitation. Upon discharge  his parents were equipped with appropriate instructions to maintain his healthy progression at home. Regular follow-ups and echocardiograms have shown satisfactory post-surgical cardiac function  with symptoms showing significant improvement.  Learning Points: This case emphasizes the complex relationship between Down syndrome and congenital heart diseases  highlighting the necessity of a high index of suspicion and early diagnostic assessment in these patients. Early diagnosis and prompt intervention can lead to successful management and positive long-term outcomes in patients with such conditions  despite their complex presentation. The role of parental education in post-discharge care is also essential in ensuring successful recovery and a good quality of life for the patient.
13,7,8,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial8,Patient Profile  Name: Jane Doe Age: 7 years old  Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Residence: Nashville  Tennessee  USA  Chief Complaint: The parents have reported recurrent episodes of fatigue  palpitations  and shortness of breath during physical activities such as playing.  Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with congenital heart disease at birth with a condition of Tetralogy of Fallot (an uncommon combination of four heart defects). The diagnosis was suspected during prenatal ultrasound and confirmed after birth. Early symptoms included a bluish coloration of the skin (cyanosis) and poor weight gain. She underwent a successful cardiac repair surgery when she was three months old at a renowned cardiovascular institution.  Family History: No family history of congenital heart disease. However  the patient’s mother faced complications during pregnancy; she contracted gestational diabetes but was well-managed with diet and exercise regimen.  Presenting symptoms: Upon examination  the patient was found to be cyanotic and dyspneic. The palpitations were reported to be frequent throughout the day and especially increased during physical exertion. The parents also reported feeding difficulties and slower growth compared to peers.  Diagnostic Assessment: A detailed cardiopulmonary examination was conducted  which showed a boot-shaped heart in the chest X-ray  and electrocardiogram (EKG) displayed right ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography revealed a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy and an overriding aorta - the four defects typically seen in Tetralogy of Fallot. Additionally  a complete blood count (CBC) showed polycythemia  and arterial blood gases (ABGs) indicated hypoxemia.  Management and Prognosis: She had a Blalock-Taussig shunt placed during her first surgery and is now advised for complete repair surgery. The parents have been counseled about the surgical risks and the benefits in her case. She would likely require lifelong follow-ups and possible medical management for her symptoms. A prophylactic regimen was initiated to prevent bacterial endocarditis.  Healthcare professionals have emphasized the importance of regular monitoring of Jane's growth  development  and physical activity levels. Jane's parents have been instructed to monitor for any signs of cyanosis  difficulty feeding  or failure to thrive as this might indicate worsening of her condition.  Conclusion: Congenital heart conditions  such as Tetralogy of Fallot  are serious disorders that require lifelong surveillance. However  with proper medical care and surgical intervention when necessary  many children with these conditions live healthy lives. Jane's case demonstrates the importance of early detection  appropriate surgical intervention  and continuous follow-up care.
13,7,9,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial9,Case Report: Congenital Heart Disease in a Pediatric Patient  Introduction:  A 4-year-old African American female was presented to our pediatric cardiology clinic with symptoms of poor weight gain  rapid breathing  chronic fatigue  and a heart murmur initially noticed by her primary caregiver.  Patient Information:  The patient  a resident of Nevada  USA  is a singleton birth resulting from a full-term pregnancy  born to non-consanguineous and previously healthy parents. Her birth weight and length were normal for gestational age  and there was no history of neonatal insults. The family history was negative for congenital heart diseases and other genetic disorders.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  the patient appeared undernourished with a weight of 12.5 kg (5th percentile). She seemed weak and short of breath. Cardiac auscultation revealed a heart murmur.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Chest X-Ray was done and showed cardiomegaly. An Echocardiogram confirmed the cardiac murmur s was due to a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) with pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  overriding of the aorta  and a right-to-left shunt  diagnosing her with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a complex congenital heart disease.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Upon reaching a definitive diagnosis  the patient was immediately referred to a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon. Due to the nature and severity of her condition  she underwent corrective surgery known as total repair procedure  which involved patch closure of the VSD and resection of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  Following surgery  the patient was moved to an intensive care unit for medical observation and recovery. She was kept on ventilatory support for 48 hours post-surgery and was completely weaned off subsequently. After a sufficient period of stabilization and control of her vital signs  she was transitioned to the ward under close monitoring. After two weeks of post-operative care  the patient’s condition had significantly improved  allowing her discharge.  On five-month follow-up  her weight had increased to 15 kg (15th percentile); her rapid breathing and fatigue resolved noticeably. Further physical examinations and echocardiograms showed clear indications of improvement. She was able to carry out normal physical activity without intra-cardiac shunt or outflow tract obstruction.  This case underscores the importance of early detection and intervention of congenital heart disease to prevent severe complications  improve growth  and optimize quality of life. It also highlights the essential role that healthcare practitioners play in regular monitoring and providing appropriate education to the patient's family.

13,7,10,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial10,Title: Congenital Heart Disease in a Young Female: A Case Report  Abstract:  This case report presents a 15-year-old Caucasian female with congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot  that was diagnosed when she was an infant.   Case Presentation:  The patient  a 15-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the cardiology department for regular monitoring. The patient was born full term with a birth weight of 3.2kgs. She was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot at 9 weeks old after blue baby episodes were reported. The diagnosis was confirmed using 2D echocardiography.  Medical History:  The patient underwent a complete repair surgery at six-months old. The procedure involved closure of the ventricular septal defect (VSD) and resection of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stenosis. Since then  she has had regular trans-thoracic echocardiography with cardiology every six months.   She also has had pediatric general check-ups annually  where growth charts have shown her to be within normal percentiles for her age. No pulmonary issues  digestive problems  or any other health-related symptoms have been reported.   The patient is currently receiving a low dose of daily aspirin due to a history of clot formation two years prior  which was successfully treated with anticoagulants. She takes no other medications and has no known allergies. There is no known history of sudden death or heart diseases in her family.   However  her mother reported delayed walking ability in her early childhood but she had caught up developmentally with her peers by the age of three.   Case Management and Follow-up:  The patient's recent trans-thoracic echocardiography showed mild pulmonary regurgitation with an otherwise structurally normal heart. Her EKG showed right ventricular hypertrophy  a common finding in Tetralogy of Fallot post-repair.   She was advised regular follow-ups every six months or as symptoms occur.   Conclusion:  This patient's case demonstrates that early diagnosis  timely intervention  and regular monitoring can lead to positive outcomes even in cases of complex congenital heart diseases like Tetralogy of Fallot. The patient is currently doing well and leading a near-normal life  illustrating successful management of this condition. 
13,7,11,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial11,Patient Profile and History:  Patient: Mr. X Age: 25 Gender: Male  Background: Hispanic  Residence: Arizona  USA  Occupation: Financial analyst Marital Status: Single  Presenting Complaint:  The primary reason for consultation was difficulty in breathing  particularly at night and during physical strain  accompanied by palpitations.  Medical History:  Mr. X is known to have a congenital heart disease which was diagnosed shortly after his birth. He has been on regular follow-ups and medications ever since. He was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of heart defect that happens due to abnormal development of the heart during the early weeks of pregnancy. Specifically  four related heart defects are present making up the condition  including ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta.  He underwent Neonatal Teaching Sano Modification surgery when he was 4-months old  followed by an intra-cardiac repair when he was 18-months old. He has been on heart medication since then  including beta blockers and blood thinners  which has not deviated from this prescribed regimen. He does not have a history of smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol. He maintains an overall healthy lifestyle and profession that does not involve strenuous physical labor.  Family History:  There is a history of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) in his family. His eldest sister  who is 5 years older than him  also has the same disease and has been operated twice.  Clinical Findings:  Upon examination  cyanosis was present  perhaps due to the deoxygenation of blood resulting from the underlying Tetralogy of Fallot. Auscultation revealed a loud systolic murmur over the left mid-sternal border. The chest X-Ray hinted at the possible enlargement of the right section of the heart  a common symptom among Tetralogy of Fallot patients.  Clinical Course:  Considering his current condition  his medication was further adjusted. He was prescribed a higher dosage of beta blockers to manage his palpitations and an additional diuretic to manage the fluid buildup in his body.  Outcome:  The increased dosage of medication seemed to have a positive effect  as the patient did not complain of breathing difficulty at his follow-up visit after a month. He was also put under observation for possible surgery in the future depending on the progression of his symptoms.  Patient Education:  He was educated about the signs of heart failure and was advised to come to the emergency immediately if he experiences extreme fatigue  rapid weight gain  fainting or swollen ankles and feet. His lifestyle modifications were continuous  emphasizing a heart-healthy diet and moderate exercise  as he is at potential risk for bacterial endocarditis due to his underlying condition. He was also advised to follow a consistent medication schedule and ensure his regular follow-ups.   Given the heritability and history of CHD in the family  the patient was advised that potential partners and future children might have a higher risk of having the disease. He was suggested to consider genetic counseling to understand the risk better and make informed decisions.   Conclusion:  The patient with congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot  has been managed primarily with medical treatments and lifestyle modification thus far. His condition is being closely monitored for necessary surgical interventions as required.
13,7,12,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial12,Title: Congenital Heart Disease in a Young Hispanic Female: A Case Report   Demographics:  A 17-year-old Hispanic female presented to the pediatric cardiology clinic with her parents. Her birth had proceeded normally  but within the first few days of her life  an abnormal heart rhythm was noted. Further diagnostic evaluations revealed a congenital heart disease. For the purpose of this study  we shall refer to the patient as Ms. Z.  Clinical Features and Symptoms: Ms. Z reported experiencing episodes of dyspnea  palpitations under physical exertion  mild cyanosis  and fatigue. She had regular doctor visits throughout her life due to her condition  which was documented as a ventricular septal defect (VSD) with secondary pulmonary hypertension  a form of congenital heart disease. Her weight and height were within normal limits for her age.  Past Medical History: Ms. Z was born full term by normal delivery with no perinatal complications. The family history was notable for cardiovascular disease; her maternal grandmother has hypertension and her paternal grandfather had a myocardial infarction. There was no known history of congenital heart disease or genetic anomalies in the family. Ms. Z was diagnosed with VSD few days after birth. She had an uncomplicated surgical closure of the VSD at the age of 5  which helped achieve a much-improved hemodynamic status and echocardiographic findings for several years.   Physical Exam: On examination  she had mild cyanosis and clubbing. There were no signs of systemic or pulmonary congestion and her blood pressure was in normal range. Chest auscultation showed normal lung sounds bilaterally and a grade III/V systolic murmur was heard in the left lower sternal border. No hepatojugular reflux  jugular venous distension  or palpable organomegaly was found.  Investigations and Results: 2D Echocardiography revealed the presence of a small residual VSD with significant left-right shunting and secondary pulmonary hypertension. A stress test was performed and it demonstrated the moderate limitation of exercise capacity. Lab tests including complete blood count  kidney and liver function tests were within normal limits.  Management and Outcomes: Due to the observed pulmonary hypertension and the patient’s symptomatic state  she was started on sildenafil and bosentan  which are phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors and endothelin receptor antagonists  respectively. The patient was also encouraged to limit physically taxing activities and given dietary advice to maintain a low salt diet. On her recent follow-up visit after three months  she reported a decrease in the frequency of dyspnea incidents  and seemed to be doing well.  This report highlights the importance of consistent follow-up care in congenital heart disease  even after corrective surgery  as changes can occur over time leading to symptomatic conditions. Moreover  this emphasizes the crucial need for personalized therapeutic strategies in managing symptoms and improving the quality of life for these patients.
13,7,13,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial13,"Title: A Case Report on a 6-Month-Old Female with Tetralogy of Fallot  Introduction:  This report is about a 6-month-old female of Asian descent  who was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) – a congenital cardiac condition. The child  born in Boston  Massachusetts  was the first-born of non-consanguineous parents. Her birth weight  length  and head circumference were all within the normal range. The family history was not significant for congenital heart diseases or other genetic disorders. No prenatal exposure to alcohol  drugs  or pathogens was reported.  Case Presentation:  The baby initially had normal oxygen saturation levels; however  at her 6-week postnatal check-up  her doctor noticed the baby becoming cyanotic (developing a bluish color) during crying episodes. This cyanosis would subside upon cessation of crying  which raised suspicions about a possible right-to-left cardiac shunt - a heart defect that allows venous blood to bypass the lungs and flow directly into the systemic circulation.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  The baby was referred to a pediatric cardiologist who performed an echocardiogram that revealed characteristic findings of Tetralogy of Fallot: Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)  Overriding Aorta  Pulmonary Stenosis  and Right Ventricular Hypertrophy. A chest x-ray was performed  revealing a typical """"boot-shaped"""" heart  further indicating TOF. Oxygen saturation levels were measured at 78%  and an electrocardiogram showed right ventricular hypertrophy.  Treatment:  Paediatric cardiologists opted for a staged approach  initially performing a Blalock-Taussig shunt operation to improve oxygenation by increasing pulmonary blood flow. The procedure was successful  with immediate improvement in peripheral oxygen saturation to above 90%.  The patient has been placed on a cardiac monitoring and maintenance program for the final repair surgery planned after she reaches 10-12 months of age or 10 kilograms of weight. The parents were educated about the signs of decreased oxygenation  possible complications  general care  and medications.   Conclusion:  This case emphasizes the critical role of routine postnatal check-ups in detecting congenital heart conditions such as TOF in its early stages. The prompt diagnostic approach and surgical intervention enabled the baby to survive and grow appropriately despite the significant congenital heart defect. The case also enlightens the importance of parental education and home monitoring of cyanotic episodes in patients with TOF.   Follow-up:  Subsequent follow-up visits will evaluate the child's weight gain  growth  development  cardiac symptoms  and progress toward definitive repair.  Confidentiality:  Due to confidentiality agreements  the patient’s identity will remain undisclosed. This report is solely for educational purposes and aimed at improving understanding and management of Tetralogy of Fallot amongst the medical fraternity."

The patient had no reported history of smoking or usage of illicit substances  although his family history reveals a remarkable incidence of cardiovascular diseases.  Clinical Findings:  The patient was brought to our clinic complaining of palpitations  shortness of breath  and a feeling of fatigue over the past six months. These symptoms were found to be more pronounced during physical activity. The reported symptoms were occasionally coupled with bouts of mild chest pain. The patient also reported substantial weight gain without any notable increase in appetite or dietary intake. There were no episodes of syncopes  seizures  or arrhythmias reported.   Avoiding physical exertion was reported  indicative of exercise intolerance; an inclination in adolescents indicative of cardiovascular pathology. He had a body mass index of 20. Physical examination revealed a murmur heard best at the second left intercostal space while cardiac auscultation showed abnormal heart sounds. There were no other significant findings evident across systemic examination.  Diagnostic Assessment:  The patient underwent an echocardiogram for the further setting of the disease. The test reported a common atrioventricular canal defect (AVCD)  a form of congenital heart defect (CHD). This included an ostium primum atrial septal defect and a non-restrictive ventricular septal defect. Moderate left atrioventricular valve regurgitation and right ventricular hypertension were observed as well. Electro cardio-graph (ECG) did not reveal any substantial anomalies.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient and his family were counseled regarding the patient's condition and the need for surgical intervention. Post-counseling  the patient was scheduled for staged corrective surgery  successfully performed without any complications. The patient was monitored in the intensive care unit postoperatively and was discharged on the 10th day postoperative.  Follow-up and Outcomes:  Over the course of the next few months  the patient showed remarkable improvement in symptoms. His exercise tolerance improved substantially  and he also reported relief from palpitations and shortness of breath. Follow-up visits in the consecutive months reported consistent improvement.

Immediately after his birth  it was noted that the child showed symptoms of cyanosis  tachypnea  and poor weight gain which prompted further investigation.  Past Medical History: According to his medical history  the patient was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) shortly after his birth. TOF is a type of congenital heart disease characterized by four specific heart defects including a ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta. He had a surgical intervention at 6 months old to correct his condition. The procedure  a complete repair  was successful and brought a substantial improvement to his condition. The patient has since been on regular follow-ups with a pediatric cardiologist.   The patient's prenatal and postnatal histories were otherwise normal and he has achieved age-specific developmental milestones. Immunizations are up to date. There is no known allergy history and no history of any other acute or chronic illnesses. Family history revealed that there are no other cases of congenital heart diseases or other genetic disorders in his immediate and extended family.  Present Condition: The patient was brought in for a routine follow-up. His growth parameters are within the normal range and his physical examination revealed a well-grown and active child. However  a heart murmur was detected during his clinical examination. His ECG showed right ventricle hypertrophy and his echocardiograph revealed mild pulmonary regurgitation  which are common findings post TOF repair.   Plan: Despite the patient's overall well-being and normal growth patterns  the detection of a heart murmur and the echocardiographic findings have led to the decision to conduct regular 6-month follow-ups. The patient’s parents have been advised about the signs of heart failure and were instructed to seek immediate medical care if these signs occur.   The patient continues to be on low-dose aspirin therapy as part of post-surgery management. He currently participates in physical activities appropriate for his age under medical guidance. It is advised that as he continues to grow  different aspects such as his exercise tolerance and possibility of arrhythmias should be closely monitored.  Conclusion: This case underlines the importance of regular follow-ups in patients with congenital heart diseases even when they appear asymptomatic. Despite an early surgical intervention and a normal growth pattern  later stages may still present complications and require ongoing multidisciplinary management.

13,7,21,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial21,Case Report: 5-Year Old Female Patient with Congital Heart Disease  Demographics: Patient M  a five-year-old female child of Hispanic ethnicity  residing in Chicago  Illinois. She is one of three children in a middle-income family. She is currently enrolled in kindergarten. Her primary caregiver is her mother  a full-time working professional.  Presenting Condition: The patient was brought to the clinic with complaints of fatigue  significantly lower activity levels than typically developing children her age  difficulty in breathing with minimal exertion  and increased episodes of cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels).  Both the parents are carriers of congenital heart disease  increasing the likelihood of this condition in their offspring. The patient's two elder siblings are healthy with no history of heart diseases.  Medical History: Patient M was initially diagnosed with congenital heart disease shortly after birth  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot  characterized by four cardiac defects; ventricular septal defect  right ventricular hypertrophy  overriding aorta  and pulmonary stenosis.   At 6 months old  she underwent corrective surgery to rectify the defects. The surgery was successful with no immediate complications. However  as a compensatory mechanism for her lover oxygen levels due to her heart condition  her body produced more red blood cells  leading to polycythemia.   She has been hospitalized multiple times due to respiratory infections since her immune system is compromised. She has had follow-up visits every 3 months for routine checks with her pediatric cardiologist  who is closely monitoring her well-being.   Treatment plan: Postoperatively  M was put on diuretics and digoxin for reducing heart failure symptoms and improving heart performance. With her polycythemia  she is at an increased risk of clotting and therefore is on baby aspirin.

13,7,23,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial23,Case Report on Congital Heart Disease  Demographics:  Patient L  a four-year-old Asian-American female  resides in Akron  Ohio. She lives with both parents and a two-year-old sibling.   Medical History:  Patient L was diagnosed with congenital heart disease at birth. Indicative symptoms were immediately evident - poor feeding  difficulty breathing  and cyanosis  leading to a prompt diagnosis. In addition to her primary condition  Patient L has had recurrent respiratory infections  likely due to her underlying heart disease. There are no known allergies or adverse medication reactions  but there is a family history of cardiovascular diseases.   Description of the Present Condition:  Currently  Patient L has been experiencing increased fatigue during play  has a decreased appetite  and occasionally experiences episodes of breathlessness and palpitations. Upon physical examination  she has clubbing on her fingers  a heart murmur was heard  and she exhibited cyanosis during her episodes of breathlessness.   Medical Interventions:  The initial diagnosis of congenital heart disease was confirmed via an echocardiogram  revealing a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Surgical closure was recommended but was postponed due to the patient's low body weight and recurrent respiratory infections. Patient L had prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis and was on diuretics to control heart failure.   Current Situation:  Because of worsening symptoms  Patient L is now recommended for surgical correction of her VSD. Parents have been advised about the benefits and risks of the surgery. Counseling and psychological support have been provided for Patient L and her parents.   Discussion:  Early diagnosis and timely intervention can prevent complications and improve the survival rates and quality of life for children with congenital heart diseases. It is crucial that regular follow-ups be maintained to monitor the child's growth and response to medical therapy while waiting for corrective surgery. Worsening symptoms  like increased fatigue and repeated respiratory infections  should prompt consideration of earlier surgical intervention.  This case illustrates the importance of close monitoring of children with congenital heart disease and the need to balance the risks and benefits of early surgical intervention against the potential for disease progression and complications. The broader social and psychological impacts of the disease on the child and her family are important considerations in medical decision-making and should be addressed as part of comprehensive care.   This case highlights the challenges faced by children with congenital heart disease and their families and underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary  patient-centered approach to care.

That was accompanied by episodes of light-headedness and fainting. Mr. A is a non-smoker with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 23 and no history of alcohol or substance abuse. He is not on any medications.   History of Present Illness:  Mr. A reports that his symptoms began gradually  initially occurring only after rigorous physical activity. However  recently  he has started experiencing symptoms even during mild exertion  such as climbing stairs or walking short distances. He has also reported several instances of waking up in the night feeling short of breath.  Past Medical History:  Mr. A was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot at birth  a congenital heart condition which consists of four heart defects. He underwent corrective surgery at infancy and has been kept under regular surveillance since then.  The patient was generally in good health until these new symptoms started. He did not complain of chest pains  cough  or fever. He denied a history of hypertension or diabetes  suits  or allergies. There is no history of similar complaints or cardiac disease in his family.  Physical examination:  Upon examination  the patient appeared conscious and oriented but slightly dyspneic. His blood pressure was measured as 110/70 mmHg  his heart rate was 90 beats per minute (regular)  and his respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Cardiac auscultation revealed a Grade II/VI systolic murmur. His lungs were clear  and no peripheral edema was noted.  Investigation findings:  A 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block indicating bi-fascicular block. Chest X-ray appeared normal with no signs of pulmonary congestion. Echocardiography indicated an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle  marked pulmonary regurgitation  and minimal tricuspid regurgitation.  The exercise stress test was interrupted at the third stage due to the onset of dyspnea and light-headedness and revealed marked reduction in exercise capacity and oxygen uptake. Laboratory tests indicated slight polycythemia with an increased hematocrit of 54%.  Management and Progress:  Based on a thorough evaluation  the patient was diagnosed with severe pulmonary regurgitation and right-sided heart failure  typical long-term complications of surgically corrected Tetralogy of Fallot. He was recommended for pulmonary valve replacement.  The patient underwent successful pulmonary valve replacement surgery. Post-surgery  his symptoms considerably improved  and he was discharged within a week with advice on medications  lifestyle modifications  and regular follow-up.  This case illustrates the potential for late-stage complications in adults with congenital heart disease  who require lifelong medical supervision  to ensure their health is being optimally managed.
13,7,25,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial25,Patient Profile:  Name: Confidential Age: 5-year-old  Gender: Female Ethnicity: African-American Location: North Carolina  USA  Presenting Illness:   The patient was brought into the pediatric cardiology clinic by her parents due to recurrent episodes of shortness of breath  fatigue  and episodes of cyanosis noted particularly during physical activities.   Past Medical History:  The patient was born full-term with no immediate complications. Diagnosed with a congenital heart defect termed Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) during her routine neonatal screening. Genetic analysis demonstrated no known syndrome associated with the heart defect. None of her first-degree relatives ever reported having any congenital heart disease. No other noticeable health issues were reported. The patient is up-to-date on her immunizations appropriate for her age.  Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  a clubbing of her fingers was observed indicating chronic hypoxia. A harsh systolic murmur was audible at the left upper sternal border on auscultation  and with a trans-thoracic echocardiogram  the diagnosis of TOF was confirmed. The patient presented a large ventricular septal defect  infundibular and valvular Pulmonary stenosis resulting in right ventricular outflow tract obstruction  overriding of the aorta and right ventricular hypertrophy. Her oxygen saturation was fluctuating between 78-85%  indicating moderate cyanosis.  Preliminary Diagnosis:  Diagnosed at birth with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease.  Management and Treatment:  The definitive treatment for TOF is surgical repair  which in the majority of cases  is carried out in the first year of life. The patient was referred to a pediatric heart surgeon for complete surgical repair which usually includes closure of the ventricular septal defect with a patch and removal of the obstruction to the outflow of the right ventricle.  Post Treatment Follow-up:  Following surgical repair  the patient showed a significant improvement with lesser episodes of cyanosis and fatigue. She will continue to require lifelong cardiac care and regular follow-ups with a cardiologist at least once a year to monitor and maintain her heart health. The patient's parents have been thoroughly counseled about the routine care  following check-ups  maintaining a healthy lifestyle  and avoiding strenuous physical activities.  This case highlights the importance of early detection  diagnosis  and surgical intervention in congenital heart disease like TOF to prevent complications and improve the quality of life of the affected child.  [Limitations: this case report does not identify any innovative diagnostic or therapeutic measures. It is a clinical scenario that aligns with known therapeutic protocols and best practices for the patient diagnosed with TOF.]  [Recommendation: further studies may be required to investigate links between environmental factors  genetics  and the occurrence of congenital heart diseases in children.]
13,7,26,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial26,Patient Information: The patient  a 2-year-old Asian female  presents for follow-up evaluation at a major hospital in a metropolitan city. The patient is an only child living with both parents and has no siblings. The family has no history of congenital diseases. They are of average socioeconomic status  with normal development and growth parameters.  Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  at 3 months of age. The diagnosis was made based on symptoms of frequent cyanotic spells  feeding difficulty  and an intensified murmur identified during a routine pediatric evaluation. Subsequent echocardiographic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis.  The patient's mother reported a uncomplicated pregnancy  normal delivery  and no early neonatal complications. However  the patient's parents noticed blue coloration of her lips and skin during crying episodes and feeding  which was the first indication of a potential health problem. The patient has experienced recurrent episodes of cyanosis intensifying when crying  feeding  or while exerted. No other significant medical  surgical  immunization  or drug history is reported.  Physical Exam:  The child presented with normal vital signs for her age  with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute and a blood oxygen saturation level of 88%. She showed signs of cyanosis  the presence of a clubbing finger  and had a systolic murmur. She also had a 'boot-shaped' heart on a chest x-ray  indicating right ventricular hypertrophy.   Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  An echocardiogram demonstrated ventricular septal defect  right ventricular outflow tract obstruction  overriding aorta  and severe hypertrophy of the right ventricle  thus confirming TOF.  Treatment and Intervention:  The patient underwent a complete repair surgery at 6 months of age  leading to no immediate postoperative complications. Given her age and weight  a surgical approach was conducted  which involved closing the ventricular septal defect and relieving the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.  Follow-Up:  At her two-year follow-up  the patient showed significant improvements. The cyanotic spells have stopped and she underwent successful corrective surgery. Her cardiac function has stabilized and physical development and growth are optimal. A follow-up echocardiogram showed significant relief from the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction with no residual ventricular septal defect.   Both parents have been educated on how to recognize signs of heart failure and the importance of regular follow-up visits. The patient will continue to have regular follow-ups to anticipate and manage potential long-term issues related to TOF  including arrhythmias and pulmonary valve replacement.  Learning Points:   TOF  if not diagnosed and treated in time  can significantly compromise a child's wellbeing. Timely identification of symptoms by parents and medical providers  prompt diagnostic assessment  and appropriate surgical interventions are necessary for a positive outcome. Lifelong cardiology care is also important to manage potential long-term issues.
13,7,27,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial27,Patient Case Report  PATIENT PROFILE:  Patient Identifier: Ms. X Age: 20 years old Gender: Female Race: Hispanic Occupation: University student  PRESENTING CONCERN:  The patient presented to the clinic complaining of worsening feelings of fatigue  loss of appetite and occasional palpitations.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient was born with a congenital heart disease known as Tetralogy of Fallot. At the age of 6 months  Ms. X had surgery to correct the defects. She has had regular follow-ups since her surgery and was asymptomatic until recently.  Her other medical history includes a minor bout of pneumonia at age 10 and appendectomy at age 15. She has never smoked or consumed alcohol and is not currently or has never been pregnant. There is no known history of drug allergies. No family history of cardiac diseases.  EXAMINATION:  Upon examination  the patient appears tired but was alert and oriented. Vital signs were recorded as follows: blood pressure 105/70 mmHg  pulse 92 bpm  respiratory rate 18 breaths/min  temperature 98.6°F  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Heart auscultation revealed a soft systolic ejection murmur. Lungs were clear  and abdomen was soft and non-tender.  TESTS & DIAGNOSIS:  An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed right ventricular hypertrophy  but no acute ST segment or T wave changes. The chest X-ray showed a right aortic arch and boot-shaped heart  typical of Tetralogy of Fallot. A subsequent echocardiogram confirmed the previous repair of the Tetralogy of Fallot and showed mild right ventricular dilation.  MANAGEMENT:  Given the presence of right ventricular dilation indicative of possible pulmonary regurgitation  the patient was referred to an adult congenital heart disease specialist for further evaluation and assessment of timing for pulmonary valve replacement.  She was also advised to make lifestyle changes to improve her general health  including regular exercise tailored to her specific condition  a heart-healthy diet  and stress management strategies. She was also instructed to report any changes in symptoms promptly.  CONCLUSION:  The case of Ms. X emphasizes the importance of regular follow-up in adult patients with previously repaired congenital heart disease. Despite a successful early repair  ongoing management and assessment are essential due to potential long-term complications.  The multidisciplinary team including cardiologists and cardiac surgeons will collaborate to determine the best course of action for the patient and her quality of life will be closely monitored in the forthcoming consultations.
13,7,28,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial28,Title: Case Report: Complex Congenital Heart Disease in a 12-year-old Male Child  Introduction: This case report centers around a 12-year-old male patient diagnosed with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)  providing insight into the unique features and management approach specific to this case.  Patient Description:  The patient is a 12-year-old Caucasian male  presenting with complaints of shortness of breath  fatigue  and poor feeding. He was born full-term  with no significant complications during pregnancy and delivery. Family history revealed his paternal grandmother also suffered from undetermined heart problems.  The patient's growth and development have been within normal parameters  though he has always displayed decreased exercise tolerance compared to his peers. He did not have any history of previous illness  except for regular upper respiratory tract infections.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed central cyanosis and clubbing. Upon cardiovascular examination  a loud murmur was heard  pointing to a possible heart defect. The patient had a body mass index slightly below the normal range for his age. No abnormalities were found in the respiratory  abdominal or nervous system examination.  Diagnostic Assessment:  Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary blood flow. Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated right atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography confirmed the suspicion of complex congenital heart disease  revealing a spectrum of defects including a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonic stenosis  overriding of the aorta over the VSD  and right ventricular hypertrophy  diagnoses consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot.  Management and Treatment:  The patient was managed conservatively  with close follow-ups and medical therapy designed to reduce symptoms and improve his quality of life. He was started on Digoxin to strengthen the heart muscle contractions and a beta-blocker to lower the heart rate and blood pressure. Given his complex anatomy and the symptoms present  the cardiothoracic surgical team proposed a total repair.  The patient underwent successful surgical repair without any immediate postoperative complications. His parents were educated about his condition and the necessity of strict follow-ups  as the patient will require life-long cardiac surveillance.  Discussion:  This case highlights the importance of early detection and intervention in managing congenital heart diseases. As seen  CHD can have widely varying presentations  severities  and treatment plans. Comprehensive management involves balancing surgical interventions  proper medication management  and patient education  leading to improved outcomes and enhanced quality of life.  Despite the successful surgical intervention  the case emphasizes how CHD patients require regular monitoring and evaluation even after the correction surgery to manage potential long-term complications and ensure optimal heart function.
13,7,29,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial29,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Information:  The patient is a six-year-old Caucasian male born on July 15  2015. His family has no history of congenital heart disease. The patient was born full-term and delivery was without complications. He lives with his parents and two siblings in a middle-class neighborhood in New York. The patient's immunizations are up to date and he has no known allergies.  Medical History:  The oatient'’s previous medical history is unremarkable. No previous hospitalization  surgeries  or chronic illnesses have been recorded. He is yet to hit puberty and his developmental milestones to this point have been age appropriate. His previous annual check-ups  routine vaccinations  and growth monitorings have all shown normal results.  Presenting Problems:  In the recent months  the child's parents began noticing their son becoming easily fatigued  even after minimal physical activity. He also began to complain of occasional chest pains and shortness of breath. The parents initially attributed these complaints to normal behavior until he faints after a bout of rigorous running at a school event. This alarming incident led to an immediate doctor's visit.  Diagnosis:  A thorough examination was carried out in the clinic  including a physical examination and a detailed heart examination. His vital signs were within normal limits. However  a cardiovascular examination revealed a heart murmur. This was followed by an echocardiogram which showed a large ventricular septal defect (VSD). Other cardiovascular structures were found to be normal. Hence  the boy was diagnosed with congenital heart disease  specifically ventricular septal defect.  Treatment:  Following the diagnosis  the patient was referred to a paediatric cardiologist for definitive care. The cardiologist suggested surgical closure of the defect  considering the size of the VSD and the patient's symptoms. After a successful surgery  the patient's symptoms improved significantly. He was then placed on follow-up care to monitor his health status and to ensure the absence of complications.  Discussion:  Congenital heart diseases including ventricular septal defects often manifest with symptoms such as fatigability  shortness of breath  frequent respiratory infections  stunted growth  and feeding difficulties. Although some defects can close spontaneously  others require medical intervention like the patient in this case. Maintaining a high index of suspicion and early detection are crucial in managing these defects effectively.   Conclusion:  Ventricular septal defect is a common type of congenital heart disease. Timely recognition of symptoms  prompt diagnosis  and early surgical intervention are crucial to improving the patient's quality of life and reducing possible complications.   This case report educates on the symptomatic presentation of ventricular septal defects and the need for prompt surgical interventions. With regular follow-ups and medical attention  the patient can lead a normal  healthy life.
13,7,30,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial30,Case Report   Patient Information:   The patient is a 3-year-old male child  referred to our pediatric cardiology department by his local healthcare provider. He is of Asian descent and originally from Vietnam but currently residing in New York  USA. His parents do not have any known medical conditions and they do not have any other children with known congenital defects. There is no history of consanguinity.   Clinical Presentation & Past Medical History:   The patient was born at term via a spontaneous vaginal delivery with no complications. His birth weight was within the normal range (3.2 kg). Despite this  he had presented signs of cyanosis and tachypnea very early in life. At 1 month old  he had an episode of breathlessness and cyanosis following feeding at which point he was referred to a pediatrician  who suspected an underlying congenital heart disease.  Physical Examination:   On examination  the child was alert but appeared cyanosed. He was tachypneic with a rate of 60 breaths/min  heart rate was 128 beats per min. and saturations on pulse oximeter were consistently low (80-85%) without supplemental oxygen. Chest auscultation revealed a systolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border.  Diagnostic Assessment:   An echo-cardiogram was done  which showed dextroposition of the aorta overriding a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)  right ventricular hypertrophy  and pulmonary stenosis. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a common form of cyanotic congenital heart disease.   Treatment & Management:   Following confirmation of diagnosis  the child was stabilized with supplemental oxygen and parenteral nutrition. Due to the anatomical challenges associated with his condition  correction surgery was planned. The surgical correction included closure of the VSD and removal of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Post-operatively  the patient showed improvements with the heart rate stabilized at 100 beats/min and the oxygen saturation levels improved to 95% without supplemental oxygen.   Discussion:   This case highlights the importance of a good clinical examination and suspicion in picking up congenital heart diseases in the early neonatal period. The common symptoms of tetralogy of Fallot are often severe and life-threatening  necessitating prompt diagnosis and management. A delay could have severe repercussions.   With timely surgical intervention  survival rates and quality of life for children with TOF can be significantly enhanced. This case underscores the importance of multidisciplinary management for such children involving pediatricians  cardiologists  cardiothoracic surgeons and nursing staff in order to provide optimal care outcomes.
13,7,31,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial31,Patient Profile: Name - ABC Sex - Male Age - 8 months old Ethnicity - Hispanic Residence - Houston  Texas  Presenting Complaint: The patient's parents had been increasingly concerned about their child's frequent bouts of breathlessness and difficulty feeding  which urged them to seek medical advice.  Medical History: Patient ABC is an 8-month-old male with a history of cyanosis during breastfeeding coupled with weight loss. The family's medical history includes a cousin diagnosed with a congenital heart defect  but there is no known consanguinity between the parents. Moreover  his birth process was wholesome  without the need for intensive care. Vaccinations and developmental milestones are all up to date.  Clinical Findings: The patient appears underweight  lethargic  and cyanotic. On physical examination  a systolic murmur (grade 4/6) was detected at the left sternal border. A Liver was palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin. Examination of other systems  including neurological and musculoskeletal  remained unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment: Chest X-ray displayed an enlarged cardiac silhouette  boosted pulmonary vascular markings  and right aortic arch. Further diagnosis was made using Echocardiography; it showed a significant Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)  overriding of the aorta  pulmonary stenosis  and right ventricular hypertrophy  which confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initially stabilized with supplemental oxygen and fluid management. Once stable  the patient was referred for total surgical correction  which includes VSD closure and relief of Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT) obstruction.  Follow Up and Outcomes: The surgery was successful without any complications. During the follow-up visits  his parents reported that cyanotic episodes had ceased  and the infant was feeding well with a steady gain in weight. Repeat echocardiography showed a significant improvement with no residual VSD and good RVOT flow. The long-term plan includes regular follow-up visits at ever-increasing intervals  with careful monitoring for any residual hemodynamic sequelae.

13,7,32,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial32,Case Report: A Toddler with Congital Heart Disease  I. Patient Information:  The patient is a 24-month-old female of Hispanic-American descent  from Dallas  Texas. She is an only child and raised in a middle-class family. She was brought to the clinic by her parents due to her anticipated well-baby check-up. Her parents also reported increasing incidents of tiredness and shortness of breath in the past couple of weeks.   II. Clinical Findings & Diagnoses:  On physical examination  the toddler exhibited an average growth pattern and normal active behavior. However  she also showed signs of fatigue and tiring quickly. Her lips were mildly cyanotic. During cardiac auscultation  a heart murmur was noted. The physician referred the patient for further diagnostic procedures suspecting a congenital heart disease (CHD).  Echocardiogram findings revealed the presence of a ventricular septal defect (VSD)  thus confirming the diagnosis of congenital heart disease. Her heart was pumping an excess amount of blood into her lungs because of the hole in the heart's septum. This was causing her exhaustion  breathlessness  and cyanosis.  III. Medical History:  Her past medical history included regular preventive care visits without any significant medical concerns. She was born via a normal delivery at full term. Prenatal ultrasounds were reported to be normal. Her perinatal history was unremarkable except for mild jaundice  which was resolved spontaneously. Her immunizations were up-to-date.  Her parents' medical history revealed no evidence of congenital heart diseases or any other genetic disorders. Neither parent has a history of drug use  smoking  or alcohol abuse. They reported no birth complications or notable issues during pregnancy.   IV. Therapy Implemented:  Upon diagnosis  a pediatric cardiologist was consulted  and surgical correction of the VSD was recommended. The parents gave consent  and the patient underwent a successful open-heart surgery. The VSD was closed with a synthetic patch.   V. Patient Status:  Post-surgery  the patient was monitored and later discharged with complete instructions for home care and necessary medications. In follow-up appointments  her parents reported considerably reduced fatigue and shortness of breath. Further echocardiograms and ECGs showed normalized heart function with no residual hole. The patient continues to attend regular cardiac check-ups every six months.   VI. Conclusions:  This case emphasizes the importance of routine examinations in early detection of congenital heart diseases  like ventricular septal defect. Despite an uneventful prenatal history  this disease can present subtly during infancy or early childhood. Timely intervention can lead to excellent prognosis  as displayed in this case report. 
13,7,33,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial33,Case Report: A Five-Month-Old Patient with Congenital Heart Disease  Patient Description: The patient is a five-month-old Hispanic male infant named J.D. He was delivered via a full-term normal vaginal delivery with no known maternal exposure to any harmful agents during pregnancy. There is no family history of congenital heart disease or other genetic disorders. He was largely breastfeeding with some introduction of formula. The parents first noted difficulty with feeding  excessive sweating  and an observed rapid heartbeat.  Clinical Findings: Initial physical examination of the infant showed a rapid rate of respiration and cyanotic appearance. The infant had low weight gain for his age and perceived difficulty during feeding. On auscultation  an abnormal heart sound was noted.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: Further investigations were conducted based on the above findings. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed abnormal heart rhythm. A Transthoracic echocardiogram (Echo) was followed and it disclosed a complex congenital heart defect known as Tetralogy of Fallot  characterized by four anatomical abnormalities. These included right ventricular hypertrophy  septal defect  pulmonary valve stenosis  and overriding aorta.   Therapeutic Focus and Assessment: J.D. was given Propranolol to control his heart rate. He was scheduled for corrective surgery  termed as Intracardiac Repair surgery  usually performed within the first year of life. In the meantime  knee-chest position was recommended during the episodes of cyanosis to increase systemic vascular resistance.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: Preoperatively  the infant was closely monitored for any cyanotic spells and heart failure. He tolerated the Intracardiac Repair surgery well. After the operation  he was shifted to the Pediatric intensive care for close post-operative monitoring. Long-term cardiac follow-up was recommended for evaluating the right ventricular function and pulmonary regurgitation. His developmental milestones will be closely monitored considering the potential risk of neurodevelopmental disabilities in children with complex congenital heart diseases.  Lessons Learned: Early detection and intervention in congenital heart diseases significantly improve child’s quality of life and reduce morbidity and mortality. A multidisciplinary approach involving cardiologist  pediatric surgeon  pediatric intensive care and developmental pediatrician is necessary to manage these complex cases. This case signifies the importance of a comprehensive clinical evaluation of infants presenting with nonspecific symptoms like feeding difficulty and failure to thrive.  Patient Perspective: The family was understandably distressed upon learning their child's diagnosis. Nevertheless  they expressed appreciation for the swift and comprehensive medical attention provided  raising their hopes for their son's healthy future. They agreed to follow the therapeutic plan and were compliant with the post-operative measures and follow-up care.   Source of Funding: No funding was required for the creation of this case report.   Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient's parents for the publication of this case report.
13,7,34,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial34,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Information Patient Initials: J.D. Age: 5 months Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Admission Date: 25/10/2022 Place of Birth: Baltimore  Maryland Admission Diagnosis: Congenital Heart Disease  Clinical Presentation: The patient is a 5-month-old male Caucasian baby with a prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Disease(CHD). He was born at a reputable hospital in Baltimore  Maryland  at full term without complications. His growth milestones are at par with his age  and he has no known food or drug allergies. The patient was referred to our facility by his pediatrician after an echocardiogram revealed a complex congenital cardiac anomaly.  Past Medical History: The mother had regular prenatal check-ups and ultrasounds  with no complications during the term. Routine metabolic screening after birth did not detect any anomalies or genetic abnormalities. At 1 month old  during a routine check-up  the pediatrician detected a heart murmur. A repeat physical examination at 2 months old still found the heart murmur  which led to a referral for an echocardiogram.  Discussion: On admission  the baby appeared well-nourished with normal growth and development for his age. On physical examination  he had a good peripheral pulse  and his capillary refill time was less than 2 seconds. However  cardiac auscultation revealed a grade III/VI pansystolic murmur in the left lower sternal border extending into the axilla.  Diagnostic Tests: The initial echocardiogram  performed outside our facility  showed Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Hence  upon admission  a repeat echocardiogram was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  shown by the presence of a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)  an overriding aorta  pulmonary stenosis  and right ventricular hypertrophy. There were no other associated cardiac anomalies.  Treatment: A multidisciplinary team inclusive of Pediatric Cardiologists  Cardiothoracic Surgeons  Pediatric Intensivists  and Pediatric Nurses are managing the patient. Our plan involves surgical correction of TOF  with a complete repair involving the closure of the VSD and relief of the right ventricular obstruction.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the importance of regular prenatal and postnatal check-ups in identifying cardiovascular anomalies as early as possible. Congenital Heart Diseases like Tetralogy of Fallot can be managed effectively with prompt diagnosis and management  improving the child’s long-term outcomes.
13,7,35,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial35,Case Report: Complex Congenital Heart Disease  Patient Information: Patient J  a 7-year-old Caucasian male child  came to our institution with complaints of progressive fatigue  recurrent respiratory infections  and shortness of breath. He was accompanied by both parents who gave a detailed familial and past medical history.  Idiosyncratic Medical Background: The patient was diagnosed with a complex congenital heart disease (CHD) soon after birth. Specifically  he was identified with a combination of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and a double outlet right ventricle (DORV).  Patient’s Familial Medical Background: There is no family history of congenital heart diseases or genetic abnormalities in both paternal and maternal lineages. His siblings are all healthy with no major health complaints. The parents are also in good health and do not have any known genetic or chronic disorders.  Pregnancy and Perinatal History: Patient was born at term through normal vaginal delivery without complications. Pregnancy was reported as normal with proper prenatal care and no exposure to drugs  radiation  or infections. Birth weight and height were within normal limits. Early milestone development was reported as normal  but mild delays were observed later  particularly after the age of two.  Past Medical and Surgical History: Following the diagnosis of the complex CHD  the child underwent corrective cardiac surgery at the age of six months. The surgery aimed to correct the cardiac anomaly; a relief of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction was performed successfully with a transannular patch. At the age of two  he experienced a challenging recovery phase coupled with several hospital admissions due to respiratory infections and failure to thrive.   Medical Management: The patient has been kept on medications to avoid heart failure and infections  which include prophylactic antibiotics before dental and surgical procedures  ACE inhibitors  and beta-blockers. The patient's growth  development  and nutrition have also been monitored closely.  Physical Examination: Physical examination revealed a cyanotic child who was underweight with poor growth. On auscultation  a loud systolic murmur was heard. Respiratory rate was elevated  and he showed signs of effortful breathing.  From this case  it can be inferred that early and regular comprehensive medical care is vital for children with complex CHD like the patient. They require lifelong monitoring to prevent complications and to manage physical and developmental anomalies. 
13,7,36,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial36,"Title: A Case of Tetralogy of Fallot in a 3-Year-Old Child  Demographic Data: Patient Initials: A.S. Age: 3 years old Sex: Female Ethnicity: Hispanic Birth Place: Tustin  CA  USA   Presenting Complaint: The 3-year-old child A.S. was brought to our pediatric specialty clinic due to persistent cyanosis and difficulty in breathing while playing.   Past Medical History: On examination of the past medical history  it was found that A.S. was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) at birth. It is a form of congenital heart disease and comprises of four cardiac defects: ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta. A.S. has shown a history of 'Tet spells ' characterized by sudden  marked increase in cyanosis followed by syncope  and may result in hypoxic brain injury and death. These spells occurred in response to an increase in the right-to-left shunt leading to severe cyanosis.   Since birth  A.S. has been under the management of a pediatric cardiologist and has undergone a series of follow-up assessments regarding her physical growth  development  and cyanosis.  Family History: There is no significant history of any chronic disease in the family. However  one of her elder siblings had a congenital heart defect but passed away due to complications at the age of 1 year.  Physical Examination:  At presentation  A.S. weighed 14 kilograms and her height was 95 cm (within normal growth percentiles for her age). She exhibited physical signs of cyanosis  particularly upon exertion during play. She also showed clubbing of the fingers  a common physical sign associated with her condition. On auscultation  a murmur was heard  confirming the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.  Diagnostic Assessment: The diagnosis of TOF was reconfirmed through an echocardiogram  which depicted the characteristic four defects of the disease. A chest X-ray revealed a classic """"boot-shaped"""" heart due to the right ventricular hypertrophy  common in TOF cases.  Summary: We report a case of TOF in a 3-year-old Hispanic female with a history of the disease since birth. The child presented with common symptoms including cyanosis  difficulty breathing  and finger clubbing. The prime objective now is to manage her case through regular assessment and appropriate pharmacotherapy  and plan for her surgery to prevent any severe consequences of the disease. Timely surgical intervention is critical for these patients to ensure their normal growth and development and to limit further complications. "
13,7,37,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial37,Patient Profile: Patient Name: [Patient's name] Age: 6 months old Gender: Female Ethnic Background: Hispanic Presenting Clinic: Pediatric Outpatient Clinic Date: [Date]  Case Report:  Chief Complaint:  The patient was brought to the clinic due to frequent episodes of breathlessness  particularly after feeding  and failure to gain weight. The patient's mother reported an increased heart rate and unexplained fatigue in the child.   Past Medical History:  The child was born at term via normal vaginal delivery with no complications. Pregnancy was unremarkable. The patient's mother had all necessary prenatal checks and reported no illnesses or use of medications during pregnancy.   Initial Evaluation and Assessment:  Physical examination revealed a slightly pale complexion and mild nail clubbing. The patient weighed significantly lower than the average weight for her age and failed to follow the normal growth trajectory. Cardiac examination revealed a strong  rapid  or irregular heartbeat  detected via auscultation.   Detailed heart investigation showed a high heart rate (tachycardia) and chest X-ray revealed an enlarged heart. The patient was sent for an echocardiogram  which determined a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) with significant left to right shunting of blood and pulmonary hypertension.  Diagnosis:  Based on the child's clinical presentation  physical examination findings  and echocardiogram report  a diagnosis of Congenital Heart Disease with a specific diagnosis of Ventricular Septal Defect was made.  Clinical Course and Management:  The cardiologist suggested a cardiac catheterization to better understand the extent of the defect. The child was optimized for surgery with adequate control of chest infections.  A complete surgical repair of the VSD was planned. After successful intraoperative management  the VSD was closed surgically. Postoperative echocardiogram was satisfactory with no residual VSD. The patient was discharged after the improvement of the general condition.  Follow-up:  The pediatric cardiologists routinely followed the child. She showed favorable weight gain progress and a decrease in symptoms on subsequent visits to the pediatric outpatient clinic. Each checkup included a physical examination  an evaluation of the child’s growth and development  and an echocardiogram to visualize the heart and valves.  Comments:  This case highlights the importance of high suspicion and early detection of congenital heart diseases  particularly in children showing failure to thrive  and stresses the need for public health awareness about the early signs and symptoms of congenital heart diseases.   The prognosis for this patient with Congenital Heart Disease is generally good. She is expected to continue improving with regular follow-ups ensuring ongoing medical management as required. The child will require endocarditis prophylaxis to prevent potential cardiac infection for any surgical or dental procedures in the future. Regular assessments of growth  development  and the potential late psychosocial impact is also recommended.

SM is a student  and has no history of smoking  drug use  or alcohol consumption.  Medical History:   SM was diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CHD) at birth and has been under regular monitoring ever since. Specifically  he was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF)  one of the most common forms of CHD. ToF is characterized by four key heart defects: ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta.   SM underwent a successful complete repair surgery at eight months old. This surgical intervention involved closure of the ventricular septal defect and relief of pulmonary stenosis. The surgery went without any complications and the initial post-operative recovery was uneventful.  Since the surgery  SM is on a regular follow-up program with cardiology. SM is generally active and participates in moderate exercise with some limitations as guided by his cardiologist.  Despite the successful surgical intervention  he has had multiple subsequent hospitalizations due to recurrent respiratory infections and episodes of cyanosis  especially during physical exertion or emotional stress. His most recent admission was as a result of a syncope episode during a school physical education class  prompting this case review.  Family History:  There's no history of CHD or other cardiac diseases in SM's immediate family including his parents and siblings. However  his maternal grandmother had rheumatic heart disease.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  SM was conscious  alert and well-oriented. There was mild central cyanosis. On auscultation  there were harsh systolic ejection murmurs along left sternal border. His oxygen saturation levels varied between 86%-90% on room air. Laboratory investigations  including complete blood count  electrolytes  renal function test  and liver function test  were within normal limits.  The 12-lead ECG showed right ventricular hypertrophy and right bundle branch block. The echocardiogram revealed a large ventricular septal defect with overriding of the aorta over the ventricular septal defect  severe pulmonary stenosis and right ventricular hypertrophy. These findings are consistent with ToF.  Treatment and Outcome:  SM was stabilized with oxygen therapy. Beta-blockers were started to control symptoms associated with episodes of fainting. He has been scheduled for a routine cardiac review to assess his heart function and to make a decision regarding the necessity of any further surgical intervention or modification of his current treatment regime. It is highly recommended that SM continues to avoid strenuous activities that may precipitate syncope episodes.   Informed Consent:  Informed consent was obtained from SM's parents to present this case and the associated data for scientific publication. This case is being reported as it can offer significant learning potential for medical professionals in managing patients with a complex condition like Tetralogy of Fallot.
13,7,39,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial39,Patient Information:  - Name: Confidential  - Age: 3 months - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian  Presenting Complaint:  The patient was presented by his mother who noticed his lips and fingertips turning blueish  along with difficulty while feeding and frequent respiratory infections. Mother also reported episodes of breathlessness and fatigue in her baby.  Medical History:  Perinatal history revealed that the infant was a full-term baby born via cesarean delivery due to breech presentation  with a birth weight of 3.2 kg. The Apgar score was 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. Early neonatal period was uneventful. all vaccinations are up to date.  Past medical history revealed that the baby was gaining weight slowly which the mother assumed as a lack of appetite.  Examination:  On examination  the baby's weight was 5 kg (below the 5th percentile)  pulse rate was around 130/min  and respiratory rate of 46/min. His O2 saturation level was 88%  indicating a drop from the normal level above 95%. The baby looked irritable and showed signs of difficulty in breathing. He had cyanosis of the lips and nails  as well as a palpable liver edge 3 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiac examination revealed a systolic murmur grade 3/6 at the left sternal edge.  Diagnostic assessment:  Based on the cyanotic presentation  a pulse oximeter reading of less than 85%  and heart murmur  congenital heart disease was highly suspected.  Confirmatory tests including Chest X-Ray  Echocardiogram and Electrocardiogram were performed. An Echocardiogram showed a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)  overriding of the aortic root  pulmonary artery stenosis  and right ventricular hypertrophy. This confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot - a kind of congenital heart defect.  Treatment:  A multi-disciplinary meeting was held with Cardiology  Pediatric  and Cardio-thoracic surgery teams. The decision was made to provide medical management to stabilize the baby prior to surgical intervention. He was treated with Propranolol to reduce the frequency of cyanotic spells and improve hemodynamic stability.  Long-term  complete surgical repair by patch closure of the VSD  resection of the infundibular stenosis  and relief of the Right Ventricular outflow Tract (RVOT) obstruction is planned once the baby reaches the age of 6 months and approximately 5kg in weight.  Presently  the baby is under constant monitoring for any signs of cyanotic spells or drop in oxygen saturation level. Parents were educated about the baby's congenital condition  medications  the possibility of surgery  and home management of cyanotic spells. Scheduled follow-ups were arranged for assessment and surgery planning.  This case is a classic presentation of Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart disease. This emphasizes the importance of thorough clinical examinations in newborns for early detection and effective management of such conditions.
13,7,40,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial40,Title: Management of Congenital Heart Disease in a Pediatric Patient  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 3-year-old Caucasian male born in Denver  CO. He was diagnosed with congenital heart disease at birth after an anomaly was detected in a routine neonatal screening.  Presenting Complaint: The child was brought to the Pediatric Cardiology clinic for a regular check-up. His mother reports that he is generally doing well  with few symptoms. However  she has noticed that he tires more quickly than his peers during physical activities  experiences rapid breathing  and has a poor appetite.  Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a type of congenital heart disease  shortly after birth. He underwent corrective surgery at about 8 months of age. The procedure was successful and the patient has been under regular post-operative surveillance with no significant complications to date. His growth and development milestones have been within normal limits.  He has not had other serious health issues  hospitalizations  or surgeries. His immunizations are all up to date. There's no known history of allergies. The patient's family history reveals that his older brother also has TOF. No other family members have known heart conditions. The parents do not have known congenital disorders nor do they share a close familial relationship.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient was found to be alert with bluish discoloration (cyanosis) of the lips and fingertips. His weight and height were below average for his age  indicating failure to thrive. Cardiac auscultation revealed a loud systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border. The liver was palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin. Other physical examinations were unremarkable.  Investigations: A chest x-ray showed a boot-shaped heart typical of TOF. Echocardiogram confirmed the presence of a ventricular septal defect and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Pulmonary valve stenosis and an overriding aorta were also present. Hemoglobin was elevated leading to the conclusion of secondary polycythemia due to chronic cyanosis.  Treatment and Progress: The patient has been receiving regular medical therapy with the ACE inhibitor Enalapril  the diuretic Furosemide  and the antiplatelet drug Aspirin. Given the recurring cyanosis and rapid breathing reported by the mother  the patient was referred for possible corrective surgery. His care team is monitoring his progress closely to determine the appropriate timing for the next surgical intervention.  Prognosis and Summary: The long-term prognosis of TOF post-corrective surgery is generally favorable  but will be dependent on various factors such as the time of initial intervention  technical aspects of the operation  and any associated abnormalities. In this patient  early diagnosis and appropriate management is expected to continue to improve his quality of life and overall prognosis.

He was born at full term by normal vaginal delivery and the pregnancy was uneventful. The patient's weight was 13.5 kg and height was 91.4 cm  indicating a percentile of 25 based on child growth standards. Both parents were healthy  non-smokers  without any birth complications or genetic disorders in the family.  Clinical findings: The boy presented with mild dyspnea and cyanosis  especially after crying or feeding. Episodes of fainting were also noted. Physical examination revealed a systolic murmur at the left sternal border along with a palpable parasternal heave. Examination of other systems did not present any abnormal findings.   Diagnosis: Complete blood count  chest X-ray  and ECG results were conducted. Due to the clinical suspicion of congenital heart disease  an echocardiogram was performed  which confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).  The echocardiogram revealed a large malaligned ventricular septal defect  right ventricular hypertrophy  pulmonary stenosis  and an overriding aorta. These findings are consistent with diagnosis of TOF.   Therapeutic Intervention: Following diagnosis  the patient was started on a regimen of propranolol to relieve the episodes of cyanosis and pallor  as well as to regulate his heart rate. Additionally  the boy was placed on a high-caloric diet to achieve an optimal weight before surgical correction.  He underwent surgical repair  which included patch closure of the ventricular septal defect and relief of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. His vitals were stabilized post-operation and the next day he had noticeably less cyanosis.   Follow-up and Outcomes: Follow-up echocardiograms 3 months post-surgery showed no residual ventricular septal defect and an adequate pulmonary outflow. The patient no longer presented with cyanosis or fainting spells. Feeding improved  and his growth resumed on a normal curve.  Conclusion: Early diagnosis and appropriate management of congenital heart diseases  particularly Tetralogy of Fallot  are crucial due to potential health and developmental impacts. This case indicates the importance of providing high-calorie feed  use of beta-blockers as bridging therapy  and definitive surgical intervention to improve patient outcome. Regular follow-up to monitor growth and cardiac functioning is an essential part of the treatment plan.
13,7,42,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial42,Introduction: We bring forth a case of a 5-month-old female infant suffering from congenic heart disease that gives insight into the complexity of diagnosing and treating congenital heart anomalies in very young patients.  Patient Information: The patient is a 5-month-old Caucasian female infant born to non-consanguineous parents in Pennsylvania  USA. The birth was full-term without any obstetric complications. The patient was born with a birth weight of 3.2 kg. The infant did not have any siblings. There have not been any cases of genetic or hereditary diseases in the family's medical history.  Clinical Findings: Since birth  the baby demonstrated slow weight gain and was exceptionally weak and breathless upon exerting herself. During the routine checks  the pediatrician noticed that the infant had cyanosis  or bluish discoloration of the skin  lips  and fingernails  along with a recurrent heart murmur.   Diagnosis: Given these symptoms  the pediatrician referred the infant to a pediatric cardiologist for further investigation. The baby underwent a series of investigations including chest X-ray  an echocardiography  and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These diagnostic tools revealed that the baby had Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a type of congenital heart disease that includes four defects  including ventricular septal defect (a hole between the two lower chambers)  pulmonary stenosis (a narrowing of the pulmonary valve)  right ventricular hypertrophy (a thickening of the heart muscle)  and an overriding aorta.  Treatment: Upon diagnosis  the pediatric heart specialist determined surgical intervention as necessary. The child underwent complete surgical repair at the age of 8 months. The operation involved closing the ventricular septal defect and removing the area of heart muscle that was blocking the pulmonary artery to alleviate pulmonary stenosis.   Outcome: Post-surgery  the infant showed substantial improvement. She started gaining weight normally; her symptoms of weakness and shortness of breath disappeared. However  she continues to be closely monitored by her pediatric cardiologist with regular follow-up appointments to track her condition and development.  Discussion: This case emphasizes the importance of prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention in cases of congenital heart disease like Tetralogy of Fallot. The patient  in this case  responded significantly well to the treatment  showing improvements in growth and symptoms. Also  the case highlights the significance of regular follow-ups for such patients to ensure any complications are caught and addressed swiftly.

He lives with his wife and two children in a suburban neighborhood. He has a previous history of congenital heart disease.   Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot at infancy. His medical history includes a corrective surgery at 6 months of age. After the surgery  he was on follow-up and maintained a fairly active and normal lifestyle throughout his childhood and adolescent years with few restrictions by his cardiologist. He is a non-smoker and drinks socially. His father passed away at the age of 62 due to a myocardial infarction  and his mother is alive with a history of type 2 diabetes.    Mr. T occasionally experienced mild dyspnea on heavy exertion. However  over the past 12 months  his exercise tolerance decreased significantly  and he noticed worsening dyspnea even on moderate exertion. He denied symptoms of chest pain  palpitations  syncope  or lower extremity edema. His primary care physician referred him for a cardiology evaluation due to an abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) picked up during his routine annual health check-up.  Clinical Findings and Diagnostic Assessment:  On physical examination  Mr. T's blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg  and pulse rate was 82 beats per minute. His body mass index was within the normal range. The cardiologist noted a clubbing of fingers and a grade 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border.  His EKG showed right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiogram findings corroborated with right ventricular outflow tract obstruction and right ventricular hypertrophy. It also showed evidence of a moderate size of ventricular septal defect with right-to-left shunting. The 24-hour Holter monitoring was normal.   Therapeutic Intervention:  Considering the patient's condition and background  the decision was made to start him on Captopril (ACE inhibitor) and to counsel him on the possible necessity of pulmonary valve replacement in the future.  Patient Follow Up and Outcome:  Mr. T has agreed to a follow-up after 4 weeks to assess the symptom's progress and discuss the surgical options if necessary. He has been advised to restrict his physical activity and report any worsening symptoms promptly.   The patient and his wife expressed their concerns about surgical intervention  the prognosis  and the impact on his quality of life  which were addressed by the healthcare team. Psychological support was offered to help them cope with the situation.   Teaching Points:  Congenital heart diseases such as Tetralogy of Fallot require lifelong follow-up  as the remaining or developing anomalies might contribute later to chronic conditions. It is essential to ensure a complete understanding of the disease  potential complications  and needed lifestyle modifications for the patient and their family. Regular follow-ups  including EKG and echocardiogram  are crucial to monitor the progress of the disease. Multidisciplinary approach including physical  social and psychological support are vital to ensure the best quality of life for these patients.

13,7,46,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial46,Patient Profile: Patient Initials: AS Gender: Female Age: 6 months  Ethnicity: Caucasian Place of Residence: Liverpool  UK  Presenting Complaints: AS presented with complaints of persistent light-headedness  shortness of breath  and poor feeding habits.  Medical History: Since birth  AS has exhibited poor feeding habits  with a subsequent failure to achieve average weight gain milestones observed in infants. She has also experienced episodes of light-headedness and shortness of breath. AS was born full-term via normal vaginal delivery. The gestation period was uneventful  with the mother having regular prenatal checks. The patient’s mother states there is no known family history of congenital heart disease.  Clinical Examination: Upon examination  AS was observed to be cyanotic  with oxygen saturation levels fluctuating between 78% and 85% on room air. Auscultation revealed a pronounced heart murmur. She was also observed having difficulty in feeding due to short breaths. Peripheral pulses were palpable but weak. Other systemic examinations were within normal limits.  Investigations: The pediatrician requested an echocardiogram  which revealed a large Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) with right to left shunt  causing reduced blood flow to the lungs and subsequent hypoxia. This finding was consistent with the patient’s symptoms and confirmed the diagnosis of congenital heart disease.  Management Plan: The cardiologist recommended surgical closure of the VSD. The family was extensively counseled about the condition and the surgical procedure. Signed consent was obtained from the parents for cardiac surgery.  Post-Operative Status: AS tolerated the procedure well. She was monitored closely in the pediatric ICU initially and later in the surgical ward. Her oxygen saturation levels improved remarkably to 98%-100%  and her feeding improved substantially.   Follow-up: At the 1-month  3-month  and 6-month follow-up visits  AS showed marked improvement in her general condition. She gained weight and no longer exhibited signs of difficulty breathing or cyanosis. The echocardiogram done at 6 months post-op showed complete closure of the VSD.   This case exemplifies the importance of early recognition of congenital heart disease and appropriate surgical intervention with effective multidisciplinary care. Regular follow-ups are important to monitor progress and ensure no complications. This ensures the child can lead a healthy life and reach developmental milestones appropriately.

Her parents are both of Chinese descent and she is the second child in a family of four including both parents. The patient has a 5-years-old brother without any significant health issues. She was brought into the clinic by her mother who reports observing the child displaying symptoms of shortness of breath and undue fatigue  particularly during feeds and while playing.  Medical History:  The child was born at full-term  following a pregnancy that was uneventful  via normal vaginal delivery. The mother did not report any complications during pregnancy and childbirth. The child's birth weight  height  and head circumference were in the normal range. She was breastfed until she was one and a half years old. She has had all of her required immunizations. There is no known family history of congenital heart disease or other genetic disorders.  However  post-birth  on the third day of life  she was noted to have a prominent precordial impulse and a heart murmur was detected during a routine check-up. She was subsequently hospitalized for evaluation. Test results suggested Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)  a congenital heart condition.   Upon recent examination  the patient was observed to have a mild failure to thrive in comparison to general growth charts  however  appears nutritionally healthy. She exhibited signs of respiratory distress such as quick  heavy breathing and visible use of accessory muscles. Furthermore  her resting heart rate was observed to be above average for her age and a continuous """"machinery"""" murmur was heard during cardiac auscultation.   Investigations:  Echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound suggested a moderate to large-sized PDA with left-to-right shunt. It also revealed evidence of left atrial and ventricular enlargement indicating increased pulmonary blood flow.  A chest x-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascularity. The electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy.  Treatment:  The child was promptly started on a course of oral diuretics to reduce fluid overload. Preparations were made for surgical intervention to close the PDA after monitoring health status and ensuring the patient’s stable condition. Other supportive and symptomatic treatment was continued.  Conclusions:  Timely identification and initiation of treatment in this infant with congenital heart disease will help prevent further deterioration  optimize growth  and survival.

The family has no significant history of congenital heart disease or any other related heart conditions.  Presenting Concerns:  The primary concern reported by the parents was chronic fatigue in the child  especially noted during physical activities such as playtime or P.E classes at school. The child often experienced shortness of breath  persistent cough  and occasional bouts of rapid breathing. The child also reported recurrent chest pain and a feeling of regular heart palpitations. There were occurrences of swollen ankles  feet  and occasionally around the eyes.  Medical History:  The child was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect (CHD) when she was three months old. Symptoms such as having a bluish tint to the skin  lips  and fingernails; poor weight gain; and recurring lung infections resulted in the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart condition.  Upon consultation  the child was found to have a history of frequent hospitalizations related to her heart condition. She had undergone and successfully recovered from a primary repair using a transannular patch and a right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction at 16 months of age.  Current Medications:  The child is stationed on maintenance doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  beta-blockers  and aspirin as a blood thinner to reduce her risk of developing blood clots. Additionally  she receives regular prophylactic antibiotics to prevent endocarditis.   Clinical Findings:  The physical examination revealed a systolic murmur  a digital clubbing  and mildly cyanotic lips. Her EKG showed an unfulfilled right bundle branch block with severe right ventricular hypertrophy.  The cardiac and chest imaging indicated an enlargement of the right ventricle  a significant degree of pulmonary regurgitation  and a considerable obstruction in the right ventricular outflow tract. The 2-dimensional Echocardiogram followed by Doppler studies suggested evidence of residual VSD.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Considering the symptomatic deterioration  there is planning for another surgical intervention that includes a repeat RVOT reconstruction and replacement of the pulmonary valve.   Follow-up:  Post-surgery  a strict follow-up plan will be implemented to monitor her recovery and manage her ongoing symptoms. This includes periodical outpatient visits  regular cardiac imaging  medication review and adjustment  and psychological support for the child and the family.

13,7,50,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial50,Patient Identification: A case report of a 3-year-old Asian female child was presented by her parents due to recurrent fatigue and difficulty in breathing  especially when she is active or eating. This exertional dyspnea and fatigue had initially been assumed by the parents to be a sign of general child’s behavior change or minor illness. The patient was not cooperative during the physical examination due to distress caused by dyspnea.   Past Medical and Surgical History: The child had always been smaller and less active than her siblings and peers since birth. Birth history was uncomplicated  with a natural delivery at term. Her vaccination records were found to be up-to-date. But a history of delayed milestones was present; she started to walk at the age of two and her overall growth trajectory has been significantly slower. There was also repeated hospital admissions  each time diagnosed as a case of pneumonia.  Family History:  There is no significant familial history of heart disease  but the patient’s father used tobacco products and the mother had gestational diabetes during her pregnancy with the patient.   Physical Examination: On physical examination  the child’s weight and height were below the 3rd percentiles for her age. She has a dusky coloration and the pediatrician found a low oxygen saturation level. There was also the presence of clubbing and she exhibited poor weight gain. A physical examination revealed a murmur and signs of congestive heart failure.   Workup: Chest radiography had shown a boot-shaped heart  and on echocardiography  there was a large ventricular septal defect  overriding aorta  right ventricular hypertrophy  and pulmonary stenosis. The patient was diagnosed with the Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of cyanotic congenital heart disease.  Management and Outcome: The patient was admitted to the hospital and managed initially for heart failure with drugs and oxygen support. Patient was then referred for a corrective surgery. The surgical operation was successful with improvement of the child's cardiological function. The child was discharged after ten days and given a follow up plan emphasizing on monitoring the signs of recurrent heart failings  growth  development  and nutrition. The patient will continue to have follow-up cardiology appointments annually.  Overall  this case report reiterates the need for prompt clinical assessment  diagnostic confirmation of suspected congenital heart disease and effective patient-centered management and follow-up for improved overall prognosis in the pediatric population.
13,7,51,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial51,Title: An Atypical Presentation of Congital Heart Disease in a 25-Year-Old Female   Introduction:  Congenital Heart Diseases (CHD) are structural anomalies of the heart that are present at birth. They affect 1 in 100 births in the United States. However  due to advancements in medical and surgical treatments  CHD survival into adulthood has improved significantly. Herein  we describe a unique case of a 25-year-old female presenting with a rather atypical manifestation of CHD.  Case presentation:  A 25-year-old Caucasian female  with no known family history of congenital heart diseases  presented to our cardiology clinic with recurring episodes of shortness of breath and fatigue following mild physical activities. Her medical history was largely unremarkable with no known cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking  hypertension  diabetes  or dyslipidemia. She also had no history of illicit drug use or alcohol abuse. In terms of her medication history  she was only on an oral contraceptive pill. Further probing revealed that the patient had been experiencing these symptoms mildly since childhood but they had progressively worsened over the last year.   On physical examination  the patient had a low-grade fever of 37.9ºC  pulse rate of 95 beats per minute  blood pressure of 105/70 mmHg  and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with decreased breath sounds bilaterally. No cyanosis  clubbing  or peripheral edema was noted. Cardiac examination revealed a mid-systolic click and late systolic murmur at the apex. Other systemic examinations were within normal limits.  Investigations:  Diagnostic workup was initiated with a chest x-ray  showing an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed right bundle branch block with significant ST changes. An echocardiogram was performed which confirmed the diagnosis of congenital heart disease - more specifically  an atrial septal defect (ASD) with significant left-to-right shunt and resultant tricuspid regurgitation.  Treatment and Outcome:  The patient was immediately started on diuretics to manage the volume overload status and was referred for surgical repair of the ASD. Following surgery  the patient's symptoms significantly improved  and a follow-up echocardiogram showed successful closure of the atrial defect with resolution of tricuspid regurgitation.  Discussion:  This case serves to highlight that CHD can present at any age and may sometimes be missed during routine neonatal screenings due to subtle signs in the early stages. This underscores the need for healthcare practitioners to factor in CHD as a possible differential in patients presenting with recurring unspecific symptoms such as unexplained dyspnea or fatigue.   This case also emphasizes the need for long-term follow-up of those patients with CHD  as they may develop complications even in their adulthood that require intervention. Appropriate referral for repair and long-term follow-up care is essential. 
13,7,52,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial52,Case Report: Pediatric Congenital Heart Disease  Patient Information  Our patient under review is a three-year-old African American male. Currently  the patient resides with his parents in a suburban community in Nashville  Tennessee. The patient has no large exposure history apart from a few playground-related injuries. He has never had any surgeries or tobacco exposure and has a moderate family history of cardiovascular disease on his mother's side  with his maternal grandfather suffering from hypertension. The patient has no history of allergies or previous illnesses.  Case Presentation  The child was presented to our clinic with a chief complaint of dyspnea and frequent episodes of cyanosis  especially on exertion  noted by his parents. There were occasional diaphoresis and episodes of fainting. The parents also stated that the child's weight gain has been slower compared to his peers. Significantly  there was no history of infective endocarditis or rheumatic fever  and no past history of heart disease was reported.  Clinical Findings  Upon physical examination  the child had a heart rate of 110 beats per minute  a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute  and a blood pressure of 85/55 mmHg. The child is cyanotic and showed signs of clubbing in his fingers and toes. A soft systolic murmur was noted on cardiac auscultation. The liver was palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin  indicating mild hepatomegaly. No other significant signs or symptoms were evident.  Diagnostic Assessment  A comprehensive cardiology evaluation was subsequently performed. An electrocardiogram revealed right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography demonstrated a large ventricular septal defect. A diagnostic cardiac catheterization was done which confirmed the heart defect. It showed elevated pressures in the right side of the heart and pulmonary arteries due to the abnormal blood flow caused by the defect.  Therapeutic Intervention  Given the ongoing symptoms and diagnostic confirmation of a ventricular septal defect  the interdisciplinary team decided on surgical intervention. A complete repair of the ventricular septal defect was performed with the placement of a synthetic patch.  Follow-up and Outcome  Postoperative course was uncomplicated  with significant improvement in symptoms observed. The child showed decreased cyanosis and improved weight gain on subsequent check-ups. Follow-up echocardiography revealed a reduced right ventricular hypertrophy  no residual shunts  and normal pulmonary artery pressures. The child will continue to be monitored with annual cardiology reviews  but the results of the surgery seem promising.  Informed consent: The parent provided informed consent for the child's case to be reported.  Note: This case is a representation of a typical presentation of a child with congenital heart disease.

13,7,54,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial54,Patient Information:  Name: Confidential (For Privacy)  Age: 5 Years old  Sex: Male  Race: Caucasian Nationality: American   Presenting Complaints: The patient presented with complaints of shortness of breath on exertion  fatigue  and frequent pulmonary infections. The patient also exhibited a faint bluish coloration or cyanosis especially on the lips and fingers.   Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) when he was 6 months old. Tetralogy of Fallot is a complex congenital heart defect involving four structural abnormalities of the heart. They include a ventricular septal defect (VSD)  overriding aorta  right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO)  and right ventricular hypertrophy. This disorder led to mixing of oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich blood  causing the patient's body not to receive enough oxygen. The patient underwent a surgery to repair the defect when he was 1 year old. His post-operative period was uneventful  with an initial full recovery. However  due to recurrent pulmonary infections  the patient was under close monitoring and regular follow-up sessions.  Family History: The family history revealed no known history of congenital heart disease. The parents are non-consanguineous with no other children. There are no other significant illnesses in the family.  Clinical Examination:  The child appeared to be cyanotic  especially around the lips and fingertips. On auscultation of the heart  a loud  harsh  systolic murmur was heard best along the left lower sternal border.  Diagnosis: The child’s symptoms along with clinical examination and past medical history led to the confirmation of the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot.  Recommendations: After confirmation of the diagnosis  the parents were made aware of the child’s condition. They were encouraged to monitor the child’s symptoms closely  especially episodes of extreme fatigue  breathlessness  and prolonged cyanosis. Regular follow up  vaccinations  good nutrition  and prompt treatment of respiratory tract infections was strongly recommended to prevent further complications. Another cardiac assessment  including echocardiography and electrocardiogram  was scheduled in 6 months to monitor the progression of the disease. Rehabilitation with a pediatric cardiologist and a physical therapist was also proposed to improve the child's quality of life.   Conclusions: In conclusion  the young boy’s case highlights the sequelae and complications that can follow even after a successful surgical correction in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot. Regular follow-ups  monitoring of symptoms  prompt treatment of infections  and adequate rehabilitation care are keys to manage such patients and improve their quality of life over time.

Upon auscultation  a loud systolic murmur was detected between the left second and third rib space. Pulse Oximetry indicated low oxygen saturation of 88%. Blood pressure and heart rate were within normal limits for his age. Growth indicators were below average  suggesting potential failure to thrive.  Diagnostic assessment: An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed right ventricular hypertrophy. A chest X-ray demonstrated cardiac enlargement with a boot-shaped heart  suggesting Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). A subsequent echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of TOF demonstrating a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)  overriding aorta  right ventricular outflow tract obstruction  and right ventricular hypertrophy.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient underwent a successful complete repair of TOF which included patch closure of the VSD and relief of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Post-operatively  he was managed in the pediatric intensive care unit. He was extubated 48 hours post-surgery and started on a course of prophylactic antibiotics. His cyanosis resolved gradually  his oxygen saturation levels improved and he was able to feed well.  Follow-up and outcome of interventions: The patient recovered well and was discharged after one week. He was set up for ongoing outpatient visits to monitor his cardiac function and development. At his first follow-up appointment after 6 weeks  he remained symptom-free with excellent exercise tolerance.  Patient Perspective: Since surgery  the parent noticed significant improvements in his energy levels and color. The child was eating well and was more playful than before.  Conclusion: Prompt recognition and management of symptoms of congenital heart disease in pediatric patients are critical for their well-being. In this case  early surgical intervention has led to remarkable improvements in the patient's health and quality of life. This case illustrates the importance of routine and comprehensive newborn screening  particularly in those with known genetic abnormalities.
13,7,66,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial66,Patient Information:  A 15-year-old Asian male  residing in an urban city  presented to the pediatric cardiology clinic accompanied by his parents. His birth weight was 3.2 kilograms  lower than normal  and he was delivered through normal vaginal delivery at term. He has no siblings and both his parents are healthy with no history of congenital anomalies.  Clinical Findings:  The patient was brought to the attention of a pediatric cardiologist due to persistent cyanosis  fatigue  and a history of recurrent respiratory infections. He had a notable history of feeding difficulties and failure to thrive  a characteristic common among children with congenital heart disease.  Medical History:  He was born with cyanosis  but it was initially diagnosed as benign and transient due to delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid. The persistence of cyanosis  fatigue  and frequent respiratory infections called the initial diagnosis into question. He was evaluated at 1 year old for these issues but no exact cause was found at that time.  Diagnostic Assessment:  This time around  on physical examination  the pediatric cardiologist noted central cyanosis  clubbing of fingers and toes  and lack of appropriate weight gain. Cardiac examination revealed a single second heart sound and a systolic ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border.  Further diagnostic tests including chest X-ray  electrocardiogram  and echocardiogram were ordered. The chest X-ray showed cardiac enlargement and increased pulmonary vascular markings. The echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a type of congenital heart disease  presenting ventricular septal defect  right ventricular hypertrophy  pulmonary stenosis  and an overriding aorta.  Diagnosis and Intervention:  The patient was diagnosed with congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot. He was scheduled for heart surgical repair which is considered the definitive treatment for TOF. His parents were counseled about the nature of the disease  the need for surgery  and the associated risks and outcomes.  Outcome:  The patient underwent successful intracardiac repair surgery and had an uneventful postoperative course. He had a remarkable improvement in his symptoms of cyanosis and fatigue and reported a significant decrease in respiratory infections postoperatively. Currently  he is on regular follow-up visits with better growth development.  Clinical Relevance:  This case underscores the importance of thorough clinical evaluation in patients presenting with persistent cyanosis and/or recurrent respiratory infections. Early detection and management is crucial to reduce potentially fatal complications and improve the quality of life in these patients.
13,7,67,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial67,Case Report: Congenital Heart Disease in a 9-Year-Old Female Aboriginal Child  Patient Profile:   A 9-year-old Aboriginal female from the Northern Territory of Australia was brought to the healthcare facility complaining of fatigue  palpitations  and shortness of breath  especially during physical activities like playing with peers. She was previously healthy with no known allergies and no previous hospital admissions apart from routine immunizations. There is no known history of smoking  alcohol  or drug exposure.   The family's medical history revealed that the patient's maternal grandmother had a history of rheumatic heart disease. Environmental history revealed no significant exposure to toxic substances  pollutants  or radiation. There were no similar symptoms or diseases identified in the patient's sibling.  Clinical Examination:  On physical examination  the patient was found to be in no apparent distress  with a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius  blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg  pulse rate of 90 beats per minute  and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Her height and weight were proportionate for her age.  The cardiovascular examination revealed a soft systolic murmur  grade 3/6  best heard at the second intercostal space along the left sternal border. Additionally  a narrowly split second heart sound was heard. Examination of other systems was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Evaluation:  An electrocardiogram (ECG) was done showing a right bundle branch block. Chest radiography revealed cardiac enlargement with prominence of the pulmonary conus. Blood workup  including complete blood count and renal function tests  were within normal limits.  An echocardiograph was performed  shifting the suspicion towards a congenital heart disease. It revealed a large atrial septal defect (3cm)  with a significant right to left shunt  right atrial enlargement  and severe pulmonary hypertension.  Management:   Upon suspicion of Secundum atrial septal defect (ASD)  the patient was referred to a pediatric cardiology center for further assessment  management  and advice. Cardiothoracic surgery consultation was sought for possible closure of the defect.  Monitoring for arrhythmias and heart failure symptoms  along with counseling the family regarding potential need for surgery  physical activity restrictions  and regular follow-up were also included in the management plan.  This case report illustrates the importance of a detailed clinical examination in diagnosing heart diseases in children  especially in environments lacking advanced diagnostic tests. Having a high index of suspicion is needed to detect and treat congenital heart disease early  significantly reducing morbidity and mortality.

13,7,68,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial68,Patient Information:   Ms. P  a 22-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to the specialist heart center for evaluation of dyspnea and fatigue. Born and now residing in the Knoxville  Tennessee area  she's currently in her last year of graduate studies at the University of Tennessee. Her symptoms  which include difficulty breathing during exertion and general weakness  started approximately 6 months ago and have progressively worsened. She reported no recent travel  medication or drug use  with a notable exception of  occasional alcohol intake in social gatherings.  Her family history revealed that her father had hypertension  and her maternal grandfather had a heart attack in his 50s. However  there's no known family history of congenital heart disease.  Past Medical History:  As per her medical records  she was born full term with no immediate postnatal complications. However  she was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) at the age of 3 months when a cardiac murmur was noticed during a routine checkup. She underwent a successful complete repair surgery at age of 6 months. Post-surgery  she experienced an uncomplicated recovery and had normal growth and development throughout her childhood. She had not needed any further hospitalizations or surgeries.  She has followed annual checkups at the local cardiology clinic  with the last echocardiogram performed a year ago showing no signs of residual disease. Her cardiac medication history involves prophylactic subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) antibiotics prior to dental procedures up until she turned 18.  Current Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed a mildly dyspneic young woman with a pulse of 88 beats/min and blood pressure 115/77 mmHg. Cardiac auscultation showed a regular rhythm without murmurs  while pulmonary auscultation exhibited clear lungs with no rales or wheezes noted. O2 saturation was 95% on room air. She had no clubbing  cyanosis  or edema in her lower extremities.  Further Investigations:  Due to the progressive nature of the symptoms  further investigations were conducted. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and a repeat echocardiogram were ordered. Additionally  a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was planned to detect any residual or progressive conditions linked to her previous TOF.  Treatment Plan:  The management will depend on the findings of the aforementioned investigations  but it may range from medication adjustments to surgical interventions. It was emphasized that correlation between clinical findings and imaging studies is necessary before any decision regarding treatment is made.  The case highlights the importance of regular follow-ups and detailed evaluation of congenital heart disease patients even in adulthood. The transition of care from pediatric to adult cardiology requires thorough communication and handing over to ensure nothing falls through the cracks  while also providing a continuum of care for patients.
13,7,69,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial69,Patient Information:   The patient is a recently born male infant  of Hispanic origin  born in the USA at a term of 38 weeks  to non-consanguineous parents. His birth weight was 3.2 kilograms. His parents have a history of a healthy and uneventful pregnancy  with no maternal consumption of alcohol  tobacco  or illicit substances during the pregnancy. The mother attended regular antenatal sessions and received appropriate immunizations including a flu shot during the second trimester. The baby was delivered via an uncomplicated vaginal birth.  Family History:   The parents have one other child who is currently 3 years old with no history of congenital or chronic diseases. There is no family history of congenital heart disease on both the maternal and paternal sides of the family.  Presenting Concerns:   The baby presented symptoms of grunting  sweating  poor feeding  and deterioration of the general condition within the first 24 hours of life. Despite the baby's term birth and normal weight  his pediatrician noticed a weak pulse and faint heart sounds during the routine newborn examination. The infant’s O2 saturation was noted to be 86% and was not improving with oxygen via nasal cannula.   Clinical Findings:   A detailed physical examination found slight perioral cyanosis and a liver palpable two finger-breadths below the costal margin. Cardiac examination revealed a grade III/VI systolic murmur heard best at the apex. There was no evidence of skeletal anomalies or dysmorphic features. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment:   An echocardiography was performed due to suspicion of congenital heart disease based on clinical findings. Results showed complex congenital heart disease with transposition of the great arteries  ventricular septal defect  and right ventricular hypertrophy. There were no signs of extracardiac anomalies based on the ultrasound of the abdomen and cranial ultrasound.  An X-ray of the chest indicated cardomegaly and increased pulmonary vascularity. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy.  Therapeutic Intervention:   The infant was immediately started on prostaglandin E1 to maintain the patency of the ductus arteriosus until definitive surgical management could be undertaken. Oxygen supplementation was provided  but the O2 saturation levels were carefully monitored because too much oxygen could close the patent ductus arteriosus before surgery.  Outcome:   The infant was successfully managed with surgery conducted at the age of 7 days. Post-operative course was uneventful and O2 saturation levels improved to 98%. At present  the child is under regular follow-up  showing satisfactory growth and development.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of early recognition and immediate intervention in managing congenital heart diseases. It also underscores the value of routine newborn examination and the crucial role it plays in the early diagnosis of such congenital conditions  improving morbidity and long-term outcomes.
13,7,70,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial70,Title: An Infant with Complex Congenital Heart Disease: Transposition of Great Arteries  Ventricular Septal Defect  and Pulmonary Stenosis  Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 3-month-old male  of Caucasian descent  presented to us with the concern of difficulty in feeding  excessive sweating  and rapid breathing. The mother reported recurrent hospital admissions and failure to gain weight.  Past Medical History:  The infant was born via normal vaginal delivery with an uneventful gestational history. However  postnatal cyanosis was noted soon after birth. Also  difficulty in feeding and excessive sweating was noticed by the parents. He was first admitted at 5 weeks of age for similar symptoms which improved after a course of intravenous antibiotics  considering a suspected respiratory infection. He was then again admitted at the age of 2 months with similar symptoms but was discharged with a presumptive diagnosis of 'failure to thrive.'  Presenting Complaints:  The parents report that their son has difficulty in feeding  tires easily  sweats excessively mainly while feeding  and seems to have a rapid breathing pattern.  Physical Examination: On examination  he was observed to be tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 54 per minute  a pulse rate of 162 beats per minute  and peripheral cyanosis was noted. Muffled heart sounds were noted on auscultation with a grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard in the left lower sternal border. The liver was palpable 2cm below the right costal margin.  Investigation Results: An initial Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly. Echocardiography demonstrated D-Transposition of the great arteries with a large perimembranous ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis. The estimated Pulmonary arterial pressure was about half of the systemic arterial pressure. Electrocardiogram presented right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy.  Treatment and Progress: The infant was referred to a pediatric cardiology center where he underwent arterial switch operation with ventricular septal defect closure and relief of pulmonary stenosis. Postoperatively  he was managed in the pediatric intensive care unit. He was eventually discharged home in a stable condition with outpatient follow-ups scheduled.  Conclusion: Congenital heart diseases may present with non-specific symptoms like difficulty in feeding  failure to thrive  or recurrent respiratory infections leading to frequent hospital admissions. A thorough clinical examination followed by appropriate investigations should be performed to diagnose and manage such infants to prevent morbidity and mortality.
13,7,71,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial71,"Patient Profile:   Patient ID: XYZ123 Name: [Anonymous for confidentiality reasons] Date of Birth: July 1  2005 Age: 15 years  Gender: Male  Ethnicity: Hispanic Residence: Florida  USA  Presenting Concern:  Patient presented complaints of dyspnea (breathlessness) with minimal exertion  recurrent respiratory tract infections  poor weight gain  fatigability  and sporadic episodes of cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin  resultant of an inadequate amount of oxygen in the blood).  Medical History:  The patient was born full-term via normal vaginal delivery after an uneventful pregnancy. At birth  he was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a type of congenital heart defect. He underwent a successful corrective surgery for the heart condition when he was six months old.  Other relevant past medical history included recurrent pneumonia for which he was frequently hospitalized between the ages of 1 and 5. Apart from this  no history of any significant illness or surgery  no allergies  and no family history of cardiovascular disease were reported.  Treatment History:  Following the corrective surgery for TOF  regular monitoring was conducted to track the progress of his condition. Implementation of proper immunizations was maintained to reduce the risk of respiratory infections.  Currently  he is prescribed anti-congestive measures like diuretics  along with antibiotics for respiratory tract infections whenever required. A strict low-salt diet was recommended to prevent fluid buildup in the body. Regular physical activity with limitation of overexertion was advised for maintaining overall health.   Recent Clinical Findings:  Recently  a comprehensive medical examination suggested the presence of a mild residual ventricular septal defect. The patient's electrocardiogram indicated right ventricular hypertrophy and the presence of """"Right Bundle Branch Block"""". Echocardiography further confirmed these findings along with mild pulmonary valve stenosis. Despite these  his cardiac function was at a near-normal level.  Conclusion:  Despite the occurrence of mild residual symptoms of TOF such as dyspnea and recurrent infections  the patient has shown consistent growth and development. His academic and social performances have remained unaffected. This growth and success of the patient are attributable to early detection of the congenital heart defect  early surgical intervention and effective long-term postoperative care and monitoring.  While continuing with the current treatment regimen  further monitoring will be conducted to assess the necessity of any additional treatment or intervention for the mild residual defects. The possibility of surgical correction for the pulmonary valve stenosis will be explored in future if symptoms worsen."

Chief Complaint: He visited the cardiac specialty clinic expressing concerns about persistent shortness of breath even during low-intensity activities  occasional chest pains  fatigue  and bluish hue on his lips and skin during extreme cold.  History of Present Illness: The patient has been struggling with these symptoms since his early teenage years. The severity of symptoms increased over time  disrupting his daily activities  including academics and social interactions. He reported no use of tobacco  alcohol or illicit drugs. He is not on any chronic medications.  Past Medical History: The patient was born with Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart disease characterized by four anatomical abnormalities of the heart  which was diagnosed immediately after birth. He underwent a complete repair surgery when he was one year old. There have been no other significant illnesses or hospitalizations post-surgery.  Family History: Aside from his own congenital heart condition  there is no significant history of heart disease in his immediate family. His parents are both alive and well. One sibling  a 15-year-old brother  is healthy with no known medical conditions.  Physical Examination: On examination  Mr. K.S. was alert  oriented  and appeared well-developed. His weight and height were within normal limits for his age. His blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg  heart rate of 85 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 16 per minute  and a pulse oximetry reading of 92% on room air.   Cardiovascular examination revealed a slightly elevated jugular venous pressure. On auscultation  S1 and S2 heart sounds were normal with 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard over the left sternal border. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.  Investigation: Considering the clinical findings  an echocardiogram was carried out  which revealed right ventricular hypertrophy  progressive pulmonary valve stenosis  and a minor residual ventricular septal defect  leading to right-to-left shunting.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical findings  physical examination  and echocardiogram results  the patient is diagnosed with recurring symptoms of Tetralogy of Fallot.   Plan: The patient was referred to the cardiothoracic surgeon for re-evaluation of his suitability for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation or surgical valve replacement to alleviate pressure on the right ventricle. Meanwhile  he was also advised to avoid strenuous activities and extreme cold. He was put on a beta-blocker (Atenolol) to help manage symptoms.  The patient will continue to have regular follow-up visits to monitor his condition and manage his symptoms in the best possible way. 
13,7,73,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial73,"Patient Profile: The patient is a one-year-old Caucasian female.  Presenting Issue: The patient has been diagnosed with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).  Past Medical History: The patient has no previous medical history other than the diagnosis of TOF at birth. The diagnosis was based on a routine echocardiogram and physical examination after birth that showed typical signs of TOF including cyanosis (blue or purple coloration of the skin due to low oxygen). A follow-up cardiac catheterization study confirmed the diagnosis.  Family History: The family history reveals that the patient's maternal grandmother also had a congenital heart condition. Beyond this  there are no known cases of CHD in the immediate or extended family.   Clinical Findings: Upon examination  the patient exhibited 'Tet spells' characteristic of TOF  which manifested as sudden  temporary deep blue skin coloration  particularly during crying or feeding. She also demonstrated difficulty in breathing and was not growing at the expected rate.  Diagnostic Assessment: A repeat echocardiogram revealed a large Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)  overriding of the aorta over the VSD  pulmonary stenosis  and right ventricular hypertrophy – the characteristic four defects of TOF. A chest X-ray showed the """"boot-shaped heart"""" typical in TOF patients  and an EKG revealed right ventricular hypertrophy.  Therapeutic Intervention: Surgical repair using the complete intracardiac repair method was performed when the infant was 6 months old. This involved closing the VSD and relieving the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Post-surgically  the patient made an excellent recovery with good hemodynamics.  Follow Up and Outcomes: Upon a six-month follow-up appointment  the patient showed significantly improved growth and no 'Tet spells.' The most recent echocardiogram showed good right ventricle function and no residual VSD or significant pulmonic stenosis. However  the patient will continue routine cardiac follow-ups to monitor her progress and catch any possible complications early.  Patient Perspective: As the patient is an infant  the parents expressed relief at the successful surgery and improvement of their daughter.   Informed Consent: The parents of the patient gave informed consent for the details of this case to be published. Note: The names of the patient and parents have been withheld for privacy reasons."
13,7,74,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial74,Title: Congenital Heart Disease in a Female Infant: A Case Report  Introduction: Congenital heart disease (CHD) represents a comprehensive series of structural problems in the heart  present from birth  affecting about 1% of newborns. This clinical case emphasizes a rare presentation of congenital heart disease in an infant with no associated syndromic features or family history.  Case Presentation: The patient is a 6-month-old female  born full-term after an uneventful pregnancy with no prenatal diagnosis of any congenital anomalies  by a non-consanguineous couple  without any significant family history. The infant is of Asian ethnicity  born in Canada  with regular immunization history. Her developmental milestones were recorded appropriately for her age with no in-utero exposure to harmful substances like alcohol  tobacco  or drugs.  At her regular pediatric visit  the infant's parents reported repeated episodes of breathlessness during breastfeeding and failure to gain weight. Upon physical examination  she was found to have central cyanosis and clubbing  along with a systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation.  Oxygen saturation was measured at 80% in room air. The rest of her systems examination was unremarkable. She was immediately referred for a detailed cardio-pulmonary investigation.  Investigations and Diagnosis: The Echocardiogram revealed a large ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) with a left-to-right shunt and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed right ventricular hypertrophy and right atrial enlargement. These findings were consistent with Eisenmenger Syndrome  a severe form of pulmonary heart disease arising from high pulmonary artery pressures due to a congenital heart defect  such as an ASD.  Treatment and Outcome: The infant was started on chronic oxygen therapy  diuretics  and digoxin for heart failure symptoms. She was also started on sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension. She remained clinically stable  with improved oxygen saturation  decreased incidence of cyanotic spells  and witnessed weight gain on this regimen. A follow-up echocardiogram showed a persistently large ASD with decreased pulmonary arterial pressure. She is listed for surgery to close the atrial septal defect.  Conclusion: This case underlines the importance of an appropriate cardiovascular examination during routine pediatric visits as early detection of congenital heart defects allows timely intervention. Considering the rarity of Eisenmenger syndrome due to an ASD  this case report provides relevant information on diagnosis  management  and implications on the child's quality of life.   This case also emphasizes the importance of screening for congenital heart disease in infancy  given the extreme potential severity of these conditions if left untreated.
13,7,75,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial75,Patient Case Report: Congenital Heart Disease   I. Patient Information   The patient  referred here as 'Mr. X'  is a 20-year-old Caucasian male  who is brought in by his parents for a regular follow-up. The patient was diagnosed with congenital heart disease (double outlet right ventricle - DORV) at birth and has been monitored regularly ever since. He is currently studying in college. He is a non-smoker  non-alcoholic  and has no reported drug allergies.  II. Medical History  Mr. X was diagnosed with DORV along with Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) and Pulmonic Stenosis (PS) at birth. DORV is a rare type of congenital heart disorder where both the pulmonary artery and the aorta arise largely or entirely from the right ventricle.  He underwent a corrective surgery (Rastelli procedure) for the defect when he was 6 months old. The procedure was successful and he was under medication and regular follow-up since then. He underwent another procedure for Pulmonary valve replacement at the age of 13  due to worsening PS. His regular medication includes Aspirin  Furosemide  and Captopril for managing heart failure symptoms.  III. Family History  Mr. X is the only child. His family medical history is unremarkable  with no known heart diseases in immediate family members. His parents are non-smokers and lead an active lifestyle.  IV. Review Of Systems  Upon physical examination  Mr. X looked well-grown  active and was not in distress. He had a mid-diastolic murmur over the cardiac apex. His blood pressure was 115/70 mm Hg  with a pulse rate of 85 beats per minute. His oxygen saturation was within the normal range. There was no clubbing  cyanosis or edema noted.  V. Current Status and Plan  Mr. X is currently stable. He is prescribed to continue his current medication regime. He visits bi-annually for a thorough cardiac evaluation  which includes an EKG  Chest X-Ray  and Echocardiogram. He is encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle and report any changes in his symptoms promptly. He is also advised regular vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia. We are also discussing the options of enrolling him in a vocational cardiac rehabilitation program to improve his overall health and quality of life.  VI. Conclusion  Mr. X's case highlights the importance of continuous management  prompt surgical interventions  and regular follow-up in improving the prognosis of the patient with congenital heart disease.

13,7,76,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial76,Patient Profile: The patient is a 10-month-old Caucasian female named Lily.  Demographics: Lily lives with her parents in suburban Maryland. Her parents are in their early 30s  non-smokers  and without remarkable medical history. They have no history of heart disease or other heart-related issues in their family. Lily has no siblings  and she came out of a full-term pregnancy without any complications.  Past Medical History: Before this visit  Lily had been seen twice by her pediatrician for developmental checks and vaccinations  without any reported illnesses. She has been observed to be growing and developing appropriately.   Presenting Concern: Lily was brought to the clinic by her parents due to persistent slow feeding  rapid breathing  as well as symptoms of fatigue and sweating  especially during feeds. Her pediatrician had initially attributed these symptoms to normal baby behavior  but the symptoms persisted and seemed to intensify.  Clinical Findings: A physical examination found that Lily had a mild growth delay. She weighed only 7.7 kg  which is below the average for her gender and age. Moreover  she had mild tachypnea with increased work of breathing. There was a visible palpable thrill in the left upper sternal border with a harsh and loud systolic murmur heard best in the same area.  Investigations: Based on the physical examination  a suspicion of heart disease was raised  and Lily was referred for echocardiography. The echocardiogram revealed a significant VSD (ventricular septal defect)  hence confirming the diagnosis of congenital heart disease.  Management and Outcome: Lily was immediately referred to a pediatric cardiologist who corroborated the previous findings and initiated her on appropriate medical management. She was put on diuretics to prevent fluid accumulation. Her parents were counseled about her condition and advised to provide a diet high in calories to make up for her increased metabolic demand.  Upcoming surgeries were discussed with the parents. They were also informed about the supportive care needed post-surgery. The cardiologist emphasized the need for consistent follow-ups for monitoring of growth and development  as well as early identification of heart failure symptoms.  Current Status: Lily is scheduled for open-heart surgery soon to repair the VSD. In the meantime  she is on medical management and under close review by the team of pediatricians and cardiologists.    This case of a patient with congenital heart disease underlines the importance of considering heart diseases in infants presenting with symptoms such as slow feeding  rapid breathing  fatigue  and sweating during feeds.
13,7,77,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial77,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease in a Pediatric Patient  Introduction:  This case report involves a 6-year-old male patient  of Asian descent  presenting with symptoms related to congenital heart disease.   Demographics:   The patient is a 6-year-old male  living in an urban setting. He attends a public school and has an active involvement in sports activities. His parents are of Asian descent  non-smokers  and with no apparent disease. The patient has a 4-year-old sibling  who is healthy with no cardiovascular complaints.  Past Medical History:  Since birth  the patient had been in good health with no serious illness or hospitalization until about eight months ago when he started showing symptoms of easy fatiguability and poor feeding. According to the parents  he experienced recurrent midnight perspiration and according to his pediatrician  he showed signs of poor weight gain. He was initially treated for acute bronchitis five months ago.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  the child looked visibly asthenic with a body mass below the 3rd percentile for his age. He presented with cyanosis  mainly of the lips and fingertips. He was afebrile. Cardiac auscultation revealed a loud precordial activity along with a grade 3/6 ejection systolic murmur  best heard at the left upper sternal border.  Diagnostic Process:  An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated right atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy. A transthoracic echocardiogram visualized a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) with bidirectional shunt and right ventricular pressure overload  thus confirming the diagnosis of a significant congenital heart defect; Eisenmenger’s Syndrome was also considered due to the presence of cyanosis.  Therapeutic Intervention:  The cardiologists and heart surgeons decided that a surgical procedure for closure of VSD would be beneficial for the patient. Parents provided consent for the surgery after detailed counseling about the risks and benefits associated. Post-operatively  the patient was kept in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for close monitoring. He was administered antibiotics  diuretics  and inotropic support as per protocol.  Outcome:  The patient responded well to the treatment plan. His cyanosis significantly reduced  and he demonstrated improved growth a few months post-surgery.   Discussion:  This case raises the importance of early recognition and intervention in cases of congenital heart disease. Early symptomatic presentations like recurrent respiratory infections and failure to thrive must be evaluated thoroughly. High index of clinical suspicion followed by prompt diagnostic evaluation is essential to prevent complications in such patients.  Patient consent was obtained to publish this case report. 
13,7,78,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial78,"Title: Congenital Heart Disease in a 25-year-old male: A Case Report  1. Introduction  This report describes a case of a 25-year-old male patient who presented with symptoms of profound cyanosis  constant tachypnea  and palpitations in conjunction with a background medical history of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD).  2. Demographic Information  The patient is a 25-year-old Caucasian male  unmarried  non-smoker  and moderate alcohol consumer  working as a software engineer. He resides in an urban area of Manchester  England.  3. Past Medical History  The patient was diagnosed with congenital heart disease during his neonatal period  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). He received a successful corrective surgery at five months of age  which involved a complete repair via closure of the ventricular septal defect and relief of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. However  he required cardiac follow-ups every year.  In recent years  he has had recurrent bouts of community-acquired pneumonia  treated with antibiotics. He takes aspirin for mild hypertension and similar medications for his cardiac condition.  4. Current Clinical Presentation  The patient presented in the clinic due to ongoing fatigue  profound cyanosis  episodes of fainting  and reported difficulty in breathing. An examination revealed a spoon-shaped deformity in his nails (koilonychia) and pallor. The classic """"clubbing"""" of fingertips was also observed  which is an additional common sign in patients with cyanosis.  5. Investigations and Results  The ECG showed right ventricular hypertrophy and 'p' pulmonale  supporting the clinical suspicion of unresolved issues related to CHD. His chest X-ray pointed towards cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascularity. Pulse oximetry revealed a remarkably decreased Oxygen saturation level of barely 80% (the normal range being 95%-100%).  Upon revisiting his echo-cardiographic reports from last year  it was noted that there were signs of deteriorating right ventricular function and moderate pulmonary regurgitation.  6. Conclusion  Following a careful evaluation of the above symptoms  the patient was diagnosed with Eisenmenger Syndrome  which is the reversal of left-to-right shunt into a right-to-left shunt due to the untreated CHD. This led to the manifestation of the aforementioned symptoms. He was immediately referred to a tertiary care cardiology center to decide upon an optimal approach to manage the condition and prevent potential complications such as heart failure  stroke  endocarditis and other life-threatening complications.  This case illustrates the importance of diligent follow-up and routine examinations in patients with CHD  given the substantial risk of developing severe respiratory and cardiac symptoms if left unchecked.

13,7,79,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial79,Title: Congenital Heart Disease in a Young Female Patient: A Case Report  Introduction: Congenital heart disease (CHD) pertains to birth defects related to the structure of the heart and great vessels. The case under discussion presupposes a 12-year-old female patient presenting with symptoms possibly indicative of CHD.   Patient Information: The patient  a female of Hispanic heritage  hails from a middle socio-economic status family residing in southern Texas. She has no known drug allergies but has been diagnosed with mild asthma  controlled with a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid.   Clinical Findings: The patient had been carrying on regular activities without notable incidents until six weeks prior to her current presentation when she began experiencing shortness of breath  palpitation  fatigue  and reduced exercise tolerance. These symptoms became progressively worse over the ensuing weeks.  Physical Examination and Diagnostic Assessment: Clinically  the patient displayed mild cyanosis of the lips and nail beds. She possessed a MRDM (machinery room) murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border  along with slight clubbing noted in her fingers. Her vital signs showed tachycardia  with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute  and an oxygen saturation level of 88% on room air. Full blood count revealed mild polycythemia. Chest X-ray showed a ‘boot-shaped’ heart and electrocardiogram (ECG) featured right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy.   Further diagnostic testing involving Echocardiography confirmed a large ventricular septal defect  pulmonic stenosis  overriding aorta  and right ventricular hypertrophy  a constellation of features confirming the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart disease.  Therapeutic Intervention: Following diagnosis  an initial palliative procedure (Blalock-Taussig shunt operation) was performed to provide better oxygenation and relieve symptoms as a stop-gap measure before a definitive procedure could be executed.  After corrective surgery was explained to the family  they provided the required informed consent for the procedure. An intracardiac repair was consequently carried out  which involved patch closure of the ventricular septal defect and relief of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.  Follow-Up: Her post-operative course was smooth and uneventful. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the tenth post-operative day. The symptoms of shortness of breath  palpitations  and exercise intolerance were noticeably resolved.  She was seen at three  six and twelve months post-operatively. Each follow-up visit entailed clinical evaluation  ECG  and echocardiography. All results were satisfactory with the echocardiogram showing no residual defects or obstructions.   Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of early recognition and prompt intervention in children with CHD to prevent long-term complications and improve quality of life.
13,7,80,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial80,"Title: Congenital Heart Disease in a Middle-Aged Caucasian Female  Abstract: This case report presents a 48-year-old Caucasian female diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CHD)  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  that went undetected until her middle age due to a mild form and lack of apparent symptoms during her childhood. The report outlines the demographic information  medical history  and her current experience with thrust into heart failure.  Background:  Mr. Smith is a native of Chicago  Illinois  of Caucasian ethnicity  a homemaker  non-smoker and with a family history of cardiovascular diseases. She maintains a generally healthy  active lifestyle but reported increased fatigue and breathlessness over the past year  which she had initially attributed to aging and her physically demanding job. She has no history of illicit drug use and is moderate in her alcohol consumption. Mrs. Smith has two children and has had no complications during pregnancy or childbirth.  Medical history:  Except for gestational diabetes in her second pregnancy  Mrs. Smith reports relatively robust health with no past concerning cardiovascular disease diagnosis. Routine medical check-ups and screenings were consistently normal. However  she had been treated for pneumonia several times throughout her childhood. Soon after those episodes  a responsible physician dismissed recurrent heart murmurs as not concerning.  Presenting Concerns:  Mrs. Smith sought medical attention due to fatigue  bouts of breathlessness  and sudden fainting episodes which had a frequency of occurrence over the past year. Upon physical examination  Mrs. Smith appeared cyanotic  with a faint """"clubbing"""" of her fingers and toes. Heart examination discovered a boot-shaped heart via chest X-ray and a significant 'heart murmur' heard through the stethoscope.  Investigations and Diagnosis:  An echocardiogram showed that Mrs. Smith had a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)  right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO)  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta. These are the four defects that make up the Tetralogy of Fallot. A blood test revealed elevated levels of hematocrit and hemoglobin. All symptoms  combined with imaging and laboratory findings  solidified the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot.  Conclusions:  This case underlines the importance of thorough and careful routine check-ups in early stages of life as congenital heart diseases such as TOF can go unnoticed until later stages due to mild expressions of the condition. Mrs. Smith's case is a rare occurrence as she was asymptomatic for the better part of her life  which may be attributed to a less severe form of TOF. This report underscores the relevance of proper medical history taking  regular health check-ups  and a high level of clinical suspicion for improved patient outcomes. It is crucial to carry out appropriate diagnostic tests for patients presenting with persistent symptoms  such as unexplained cyanosis and breathlessness  no matter their age or background. Efforts ought to be made by clinicians to investigate further  even if past medical history does not necessarily indicate a cardiovascular etiology."

The patient is a full-time student but is currently enrolled in online schooling due to health issues.  Medical History:   The patient was diagnosed with Congenital Heart Disease  more specifically Tetralogy of Fallot  at birth. He underwent a successful full repair surgery at six months of age. Other than CHD  the patient does not have any additional congenital abnormalities or genetic disorders.  The patient has a history of frequent cyanotic spells  shortness of breath  and fatigue during physical activity. In terms of his overall health history  the patient had bouts of pneumonia at six and nine years of age  and has a known allergy to penicillin  which results in a rash.   Family History:   The patient’s mother  aged 40  is alive and well  with no history of heart disease. His father  aged 48  is alive and has a history of ischemic heart disease. The patient has a younger sibling  aged 10  who is healthy with no cardiac abnormalities. There is no family history of Rheumatic heart disease or sudden cardiac death.  Current Presentation:   The patient was referred to the cardiology clinic by his pediatrician due to an increasing number of cyanotic spells and a noticeable decline in his endurance during physical activities  which has impacted his overall quality of life. These increasing symptoms have caused him to miss school and withdraw from sports activities.   Recent Physical Examination:   On examination  the patient's heart rate was slightly elevated at 97 bpm  blood pressure was within normal range  and oxygen saturation was sub-normal at 88% on air.  A cardiac examination revealed a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard in the left upper sternal border.  Recent Investigations:   An electrocardiogram revealed right bundle branch block  right atrial enlargement  and extreme right axis deviation. The chest x-ray showed boot-shaped heart characteristic of Tetralogy of Fallot  confirming the diagnosis.   An echocardiogram further demonstrated a large ventricular septal defect  right ventricular hypertrophy  an overly muscular right ventricle  and pulmonary stenosis – aligning with the patient's TOF diagnosis.  Current Management Plan:  The patient was recommended for cardiac re-evaluation including cardiac catheterization to assess the anatomy and pressures in his heart chambers and blood vessels. Depending on the results  he may be considered for corrective surgery  intended to improve blood flow to his lungs and enhance his overall quality of life. Additionally  the patient was prescribed beta-blockers  to regulate his heart rate and reduce the frequency of his cyanotic spells.   Follow-up:  It was recommended that the patient continue to follow-up with the cardiology clinic every six months to ensure close monitoring of his condition and continued medication regulation. The patient’s family education concerning the importance of medication compliance also took place.   Patient’s current health status is stable and under close observation.

13,7,83,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial83,Patient Information: A two-year-old Caucasian male presenting in the pediatric department.  Case History: The patient  accompanied by his parents  was referred from a local community clinic. The child has been noted with poor weight gain  recurrent respiratory tract infections  and increased breathlessness while feeding since birth. These symptoms have progressively worsened over the last couple of months.  Birth History: The patient was born at term with an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Low birth weight was noted (2.5 Kg). The family history revealed no congenital heart disease or other similar conditions. There were no apparent prenatal or postnatal complications.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient appeared cyanotic with noticeable clubbing of the fingers and toes. His weight is below the 5th percentile for his age. Heart sounds were irregular with the presence of a heart murmur. Breath sounds were diminished on the left side with scattered rhonchi.   Medical Investigations: A chest X-ray was performed which indicated an enlarged heart and increased pulmonary vascular markings. An Electrocardiogram detected right axis deviation. 2-D Echocardiography demonstrated a large VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect)  overriding aorta  right ventricular hypertrophy  and pulmonary stenosis  suggesting a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot - a type of congenital heart disease.  Additional Investigations: The Hemoglobin estimation was performed due to the patient's symptoms of cyanosis and clubbing  revealing polycythemia (an increase in the total red blood cell mass). A genetic study was proposed considering congenital heart disease can sometimes be associated with genetic disorders including Down syndrome  DiGeorge syndrome  and others  however  the parents declined.  Management: A multidisciplinary team approach was initiated. The intake and concentration of calories were increased incorporating dietary supplements high in calorie to manage the child's poor weight.   As for his congenital heart disease  after discussing with the parents  a decision was made to conduct a cardiac catheterization as a palliative measure to improve the child's oxygen saturation levels and reduce cyanotic spells until complete corrective surgery can be performed.   Subsequently  once the child gains suitable weight and condition  a complete corrective surgery is being planned. The family was counseled about the nature and prognosis of the disease  the requirement for life-long cardiac follow-up  potential complications  and the possibility of genetic recurrence in future pregnancies.   Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of early recognition of congenital heart disease  which might present with subtle symptoms like failure to thrive and recurrent respiratory infections  but might rapidly progress if left untreated. Careful monitoring and timely intervention are essential to ensure a favorable prognosis and improve the quality of life for such patients.

He is a full-time student attending middle school and lives with his parents and younger sibling. He is not exposed to smoke or alcohol. There have been no documented environmental exposures.  Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with congenital heart disease shortly after his birth. Specifically  he was diagnosed with a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)  the most common type of congenital heart defect. He underwent a surgical correction procedure for the same when he was just nine months old. After that  the patient's cardiac function has been monitored regularly  and he has attended regular reviews with a pediatric cardiologist.  The patient’s family history reveals that his maternal grandfather had an undiagnosed heart condition and died in his early 50s. His mother has hypothyroidism but is otherwise healthy  and his father has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The patient’s younger sibling does not have any known medical problems.  Presenting Problem:  The patient visited the hospital with complaints of difficulty in breathing and fatigue after minor physical exertion like walking a short distance or climbing stairs. He also reported episodes of palpitations in the last few weeks.  Examination & Findings:  On examination  he was found to have mild cyanosis and clubbing of the fingers. However  his vital signs were within normal limits. Auscultation of the chest revealed a loud  harsh holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border.  Investigations including an echocardiogram confirmed a recurrence of the VSD  complicated by pulmonary hypertension. Given the patient’s age  size  and specific anatomy  thedecision was made to manage his condition using a combined approach of medication and periodic monitoring. He was started on heart failure medications  including diuretics  ACE inhibitors  and Beta-blockers.  Follow-Up and Plan:  The plan is to follow up the patient in three months to monitor his response to medications  and symptoms and to adjust the treatment plan as needed. Upon reaching appropriate size and weight  reconsideration for a surgical closure of the VSD will be evaluated depending on the patient's condition.  Patient Education:  The patient's parents were counseled about the need for medication adherence  potential side effects  and what to do in an emergency. The patient was also counseled about the importance of avoiding strenuous activities that may cause undue stress on his heart and maintaining a heart-healthy diet.  In this situation  our patient's past medical history  family history  and presenting symptoms were crucial in shaping his diagnostic journey. Regular monitoring and early medical intervention have been beneficial in managing this complex case of congenital heart disease. Further  patient and parental education play a significant role in managing chronic illnesses in children.

13,7,86,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial86,Title: A Case of Congenital Heart Disease in a Neonate: Complicated with Tetralogy of Fallot  Introduction: This report presents a case study on a neonatal patient with a complex congenital heart disease (CHD) known as Tetralogy of Fallot. This is a four-fold condition involving structural defects in the heart and severe cyanosis  which can lead to hypoxia.  Patient Demographics: The patient is a male neonate born on the date of 4th July 2021 at a gestational age of 38 weeks via cesarean section. Birth weight was 2.9kg  and Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes post-delivery respectively. He is the third child to a Caucasian couple in Akron  Ohio. The family's medical history revealed no genetic disorders or significant medical conditions.  Clinical Findings: The neonate initially presented poor feeding and became cyanosed shortly after birth during crying episodes. With oxygen desaturation to as low as 68%  the patient was sent for echocardiography.   Investigations & Diagnosis: The Echocardiogram revealed significant findings of Tetralogy of Fallot: ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta. No additional defects were noted.  Treatment & Outcome: Emergency stabilizing measures were taken  including maintaining the neonate on prostaglandin E1 to prevent ductal closure and allow increased pulmonary blood flow. After stabilization  surgical intervention for the Tetralogy of Fallot was planned. The neonate underwent successful corrective surgery at the age of three months  showing improvement in cyanosis and feeding. Postoperative echocardiograms revealed significant reduction in right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary stenosis.  Follow-Up: Currently  the baby is six months old. Improvement in growth parameters was noted in follow-up cardiology appointments. He is scheduled for regular follow-up visits to monitor cardiac function  motor and cognitive development.  Discussion: This case exemplifies the challenging diagnosis and successful management of a cyanotic congenital heart disease  Tetralogy of Fallot  in a neonate that presented with cyanosis and feeding difficulties. Early diagnosis and appropriate intervention resulted in an improved prognosis and quality of life for this patient.  Conclusion: Congenital heart diseases  although not always evident at birth  can present potential medical emergencies. This case reinforces the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for infants suspected of having structural heart defects.
13,7,87,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial87,Title: An Unusual Case of Tetralogy of Fallot in a 45-year-old Male   Patient Profile: The patient is a 45-year-old Caucasian male. He was born in a time period when the mortality rates of congenital heart diseases  particularly Tetralogy of Fallot was high. He has been a lifetime resident of Oregon  USA. The man is single and works as a library assistant. He is a non-smoker and doesn't consume alcohol.   Presenting Complaints: The patient continually experienced breathlessness  fatigue  and cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin) due to low oxygen levels in the blood  thus prompting for frequent medical inspections.  Past Medical History: It was noted that the patient was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart defect  shortly after birth. This condition involves four heart defects: ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary stenosis  a misplaced aorta  and a thickened right ventricular wall (right ventricular hypertrophy).   Despite the severe implications of his disease  the patient has managed to live to adulthood without any significant surgical intervention  which is quite unusual for these cases. His medical management mainly involved beta-blockers and diuretics. The patient’s health had been supported with this minimal treatment modality  which made him one of the approximately 3% of adults with congenital heart disease who achieve a relatively normal life without surgical intervention.  Unfortunately  his condition has been gradually deteriorating over the years  and he has been recommended for a total intracardiac repair  a corrective surgery for his disease; however  he keeps postponing the surgery due to personal reasons.  Interestingly  the patient does not have significant additional health conditions  except for mild hypertension likely related to his heart condition. He has no history of diabetes  cancers  or respiratory diseases.  This case presents a unique example of the natural history and course of untreated Tetralogy of Fallot and the remarkable body's adaption to address the physiological challenges posed by this congenital condition.
13,7,88,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial88,Patient Profile: A 23-month-old male presented for a routine follow up with pediatric cardiology. The child was initially seen shortly after birth upon detection of a cardiac murmur  which was initially suspected to be due to a patent ductus arteriosus. The patient is of Asian descent  born at 39 weeks gestation via vaginal delivery to non-consanguineous healthy parents. The patient's birth weight was 3.2 kg and he did not require neonatal intensive care. The patient is the second child in the family  with an older sister who is healthy with no known congenital disorders. Clinical examination of the other family members is unremarkable.  Present Complaint: On physical examination  the child appeared well with normal developmental milestones. There were no features of Down’s syndrome or any dysmorphic features. An apex beat was palpated in the 5th intercostal space and mid-clavicular line. A grade 3/6 pansystolic murmur was heard  loudest at the lower left sternal edge.  Investigation and Diagnosis: Subsequent echocardiographic evaluation revealed Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Further evaluation using cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and cardiac catheterization confirmed TOF with pulmonary stenosis  ventricular septal defect (VSD)  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta.  Course of Treatment: Conservative management was initiated in the neonatal period  but due to persistent growth retardation and worsening cyanotic spells (hypoxemia)  the decision was made to undergo total correction surgery. The surgical correction was performed at the age of 9 months by employing the techniques of VSD patch closure and relief of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.  Present Condition: Now at the age of 23 months  the patient is thriving well with improved weight gain and motor development. He is able to engage in age-appropriate physical activities. A follow-up echocardiogram shown significant improvement in heart structure and functioning.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the role of early detection and timely intervention in managing congenital heart diseases like Tetralogy of Fallot. The patient responded well to the surgical intervention and is currently showing good overall development. This patient will continue to be monitored by pediatric cardiology for managing any potential late post-operative complications such as pulmonary regurgitation  ventricular arrhythmia  and right heart failure. This illustrates that with a thorough diagnostic work-up and timely intervention  children with Tetralogy of Fallot can lead healthy and active lives.
13,7,89,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial89,Patient Information:  The patient is a male newborn  two hours old  delivered at 37 weeks gestation in a rural healthcare center via normal spontaneous delivery. The mother  aged 27  has had a relatively uneventful pregnancy. There was no history of in-utero drug or alcohol exposure. There is no known family history of congenital anomalies or heart disease. The patient’s Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes of life  respectively.  Case Presentation:  Approximately one hour after birth  the nursing staff noticed signs of respiratory distress in the neonate  including increased work of breathing and grunting. The child's oxygen saturation levels were low  ranging between 85 and 90%. Signs of circumoral and mild central cyanosis were observed. Upon physical examination  a murmur was detected suggesting possible congenital heart disease.  Diagnostic Assessment:  The newborn was resuscitated and stabilization measures were initiated. The pediatrician requested a sequence of investigations to further investigate the possibility of a congenital heart defect. The patient’s chest x-ray showed an abnormal heart shadow  suggesting an enlarged heart. The echocardiogram revealed a significant heart anomaly consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) which includes ventricular septal defect (VSD)  overriding aorta  pulmonary stenosis  and right ventricular hypertrophy.  Therapeutic Intervention:  Following the diagnosis  the patient was initially managed with prostaglandin E1 to keep the ductus arteriosus patent and improve oxygenation. The child was transferred to a tertiary care facility for further management. He was placed on diuretics and supplemental oxygen. The parents were counseled and consented for an upcoming surgery for total correction of TOF.  Follow-Up and Outcomes:  The baby underwent complete repair surgery of the TOF at three weeks of age. Post-operatively  he remained in the ICU for a week under close monitoring. The recovery was successful with the infant's oxygen saturation maintaining at a healthy level. The murmur significantly diminished after surgery. The infant continued to do well and was discharged home on post-operative day 14.  The parents were instructed to continue with the child's prescribed medication: a diuretic (furosemide) and antiplatelet (aspirin). They were also provided instructions regarding signs of congestive heart failure  infection  poor feeding  or any other complications to watch for. The parents were advised to have regular follow-ups with a pediatric cardiologist every six months to monitor the child's growth and heart condition.  In conclusion  this case demonstrates that high clinical suspicion and prompt diagnosis can significantly impact the prognosis of congenital heart diseases in the newborn population  particularly in resource-limited settings  where specialized care may be delayed or unavailable.
13,7,90,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial90,Patient's Information:   Name: XXX XXX  Gender: Male  Age: 3 months old  Marital status: Unmarried  Occupation: N/A  Religion: N/A  Race: White  Ethnicity: Hispanic  Language: N/A (family speaks Spanish)  Address: XXX XXX  Florida  USA   Case Report:  Subject's name has been kept confidential due to ethical considerations. The 3-month-old male infant was brought to our attention by his parents who were concerned about his poor feeding habits  rapid breathing  and failure to gain weight. After the initial consultation  the child was recommended for further diagnostic evaluation based on the symptoms presented.  Past Medical History: No previous record of illness. Birth history within normal parameters  born at 39 weeks gestation by spontaneous vaginal delivery. The prenatal period was uneventful  and there's no known family history of congenital heart disease. Mother's pregnancy and delivery were normal according to available records.  Physical Examination: At presentation  the child appeared cyanotic (bluish skin) particularly during feeding. Disproportionate increase in respiratory rate was observed during and after feeds. There was no physical deformity except for mild clubbing of the fingers. There was an audible heart murmur during auscultation.  Investigations: An echocardiogram was performed that showed ventricular septal defect (VSD) and atrial septal defect (ASD)  along with a narrowing of the pulmonary valve  a condition known as pulmonary stenosis. Further  the right ventricle was seen to be larger than the left  pointing towards a condition known as right ventricle hypertrophy. These findings resonate with the features of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a type of cyanotic congenital heart disease.  Treatment: After discussing treatment options with the parents  a decision was made to proceed with corrective heart surgery. The surgery involved closing the ventricular and atrial septal defects with patches  widening the pulmonary valve  and removing the excess muscle in the right ventricle.  Outcome: The infant tolerated the procedure well  and the early postoperative course was uneventful. He was discharged home after a two-week hospital stay. Regular follow-ups have been advised for cardiovascular fitness monitoring.  The requirement to continually monitor this young patient's recovery emphasizes the family's vital role in celebrating even small increments of improvement and resilience. It is also essential to carry out genetic counseling to assess the risk of recurrence in future offspring.
13,7,91,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial91,Title: A Case Report - Congenital Heart Disease in a Three-Year-Old Female  Introduction: This case report describes a three-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD). The patient resides in rural Texas  USA.  Patient Information: The patient  a Caucasian female  was born at home on September 1  2016. She is three years old and is the second child in her family. The patient's prenatal history was uncomplicated  the birth history records a full-term normal vaginal delivery  and early developmental milestones were achieved on time.   Past Medical History: The patient's parents reported recurring symptoms of respiratory tract infections started when she was around six months old. As recalled by her parents  she had repeated episodes of cough and cold illnesses  often lasting more than a week  with prolonged recovery phases. Despite the frequent infections  growth and development milestones have been generally on par with age expectations. She has not been hospitalized or undergone any surgeries.   Physical Examination: The patient appeared normal  her weight was 14.5 kg (52nd percentile for age and gender)  and her height was 93 cm (47th percentile for age and gender). During the examination  she was active and cooperative  but her breathing appeared mildly labored. Auscultation of the heart revealed a grade 3/6  harsh  pansystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. Femoral pulses were slightly delayed with respect to the radial pulses.  Additional Investigations: Given the physical findings  a complete cardiovascular workup was performed. This involved a chest X-ray (showed an enlarged globular heart)  an electrocardiogram (showed right ventricular hypertrophy and right axis deviation)  and an echocardiograph  which confirmed the presence of a ventricular septal defect (VSD).  Diagnosis: Based on the above findings  the patient was diagnosed with a Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) - specifically  Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD).  Treatment: The patient was referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further management of her condition. Open-heart surgery to close the VSD was planned in consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon. In the meantime  she was started on medications to manage her symptoms and prevent heart failure.  Discussion: Early diagnosis and treatment of CHD can help reduce symptoms  improve long-term quality of life  and increase survival rates. This case highlights the importance of careful consideration of growth and recurrent infection history in the diagnosis of such conditions. The case also emphasizes the critical role of echocardiography in evaluating suspected cases of CHD.  Conclusion: While this patient's CHD was identified later than is ideal  the referral for surgical management offers a good prognosis. It is essential for healthcare professionals to maintain a high index of suspicion for CHD in children who present with recurring respiratory infections or who display any abnormalities in their heart sounds during routine physical examinations.

Heart auscultation revealed a pansystolic murmur. She had a relatively small stature and her growth parameters were below the normal range for her age group.   ## Diagnostic Assessment:  An electrocardiography (EKG) showed right axis deviation and features of right ventricular hypertrophy. Further echocardiography confirmed a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) along with pulmonary stenosis  overriding of aorta and right ventricular hypertrophy  highlighting the classic tetralogy of Fallot.  Chest X-ray indicated a """"boot-shaped"""" heart  indicative of the right ventricular hypertrophy and a decreased pulmonary vascular marking. Hematological tests showed an increased hemoglobin and hematocrit level indicating secondary polycythemia.  Genetic testing was suggested given the high association with genetic disorders but parental consent could not be obtained. The patient also suffers from mild mental retardation.  ## Therapeutic Intervention:  After stabilizing her with supplemental oxygen  a course of prostaglandin E1 was commenced to maintain the ductal patency. She was advised to avoid any exertional activities or straining.  Subsequently  she underwent complete repair surgery in which the VSD was patched and the obstruction to the right ventricular outflow tract was relieved.   Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged with a prescription for aspirin to prevent postoperative coagulopathy  diuretics for ventricular dysfunction control  digoxin for heart failure management  and infective endocarditis prophylaxis as per the established guidelines.  ## Follow-up and Outcomes:  The patient's symptoms improved gradually with no further episodes of cyanotic spells over a follow-up of 6-months. She showed improvement in growth parameters and an overall improvement in her quality of life. The patient continues to follow-up in the cardiology clinic.  ## Conclusion:  This case represents a common congenital heart defect – tetralogy of Fallot. Timely diagnosis  early surgical intervention  and continued follow-up are crucial in the management of such cases. Regular follow-up and appropriate management can offer these patients the potential for a normal life expectancy and quality of life. "

Patient Information  Name: [Removing identifiable information for privacy] Gender: Female Ethnic Origin: Hispanic Age: 3 months old  II. Chief Complaint  The patient's mother reports a failure to thrive  reduced capacity for breastfeeding and shortness of breath.  III. Past medical and family cardiac history  The patient was born full-term without complications and has no known allergies. Her immunizations are up-to-date. Her older sibling also has a history of congenital heart disease. The mother had routine prenatal care and did not use alcohol  tobacco or illicit substances during pregnancy. There is no known family history of rheumatic fever  hypertension  or early sudden death.  IV. Physical Examination and Vital Signs  Upon physical examination  the infant had cyanosis  tachypnea  a heart rate of 155 beats per minute  a respiratory rate of 45 breaths per minute  and an oxygen saturation level of 89% on room air. She also exhibited poor weight gain – she weighed 3.4 kilograms  which is below the 5th percentile for her age group.  V. Diagnostic Assessment  Echocardiography revealed the presence of Tetralogy of Fallot  congenital heart disease that involves four anatomical abnormalities of the heart. It showed a ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  an overriding aorta  and right ventricular hypertrophy.  VI. Therapeutic Intervention and Outcome  The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit where she was initially managed with a prostaglandin E1 infusion to maintain ductus arteriosus patency. Oxygen therapy was provided to alleviate cyanosis. She was then planned for surgical repair. Total correction with closure of ventricular septal defect and relief of pulmonary stenosis was performed. After surgery  the patient showed significant improvement in her clinical condition. She gained weight and was able to feed normally. Now she is under regular follow-ups with the pediatric cardiology team.  VII. Prognosis and Follow-up Plans  Given that our patient's condition has been surgically corrected and is being managed well  the prognosis is good with a possibility of normal growth and physical development with periodic monitoring and appropriate care.

13,7,94,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial94,Case Report: Congenital Heart Disease in a Four-Year-Old Girl  Introduction  This case report describes a four-year-old Caucasian girl diagnosed with congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The ethical guidelines and privacy policy of the institution were strictly followed in presenting this case.  Demographics  The patient is a four-year-old Caucasian girl  living with her parents in Chicago City  Illinois. She was born at term  with normal perinatal history. She is the only child of a 32-year-old mother and a 34-year-old father  both of whom appear to be of good health  with no apparent familial history of hereditary or cardiovascular illnesses on either side of the family. She attends a local kindergarten and has normal growth and development for her age.  Past Medical History  The patient was diagnosed with TOF at age six months after her parents took her to their pediatrician due to concerns about episodes of bluish coloration of her skin (cyanosis) during crying and feeding  along with mild breathlessness. They also reported that she had poor weight gain since birth.  She was referred to a pediatric cardiologist and following initial physical examination  detailed cardiac evaluation was conducted using transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The TTE results confirmed the diagnosis of TOF  demonstrating high-ventricular septal defect (VSD)  right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)  overriding aorta and pulmonary stenosis.  Her parents were advised about the nature of the condition  the requirement of future surgical intervention  and the need for follow up. She was started on a pharmacological therapy including beta-blockers and diuretics to manage her symptoms and has been followed up every three months for clinical evaluation  growth monitoring and echocardiographic assessment.  She will require cardiac surgery in future to correct all the deformities  which will be planned according to her growth  development and disease progression.  Patient's Current Health  Over the past three plus years  she has generally remained clinically stable with normal cognitive development and good response to the medical treatment. She continues her routine follow-ups  displaying adequate weight gain and growth.  The surgical team is planning a corrective surgery for TOF within the next six months. They are closely monitoring her growth  development and any changes in symptoms. Her parents have been apprised of the surgical plan and are providing good support to the child.  Conclusion  This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis  regular monitoring  and family support in managing congenital heart diseases in pediatric patients. Future reports following this patient's progress after surgical intervention will offer valuable insights into the long-term prognosis and quality of life for children with TOF. 
13,7,95,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial95,Patient Profile:   Demographics: Patient Name: [Redacted for privacy] Gender: Male Age: 9 years Ethnicity: Caucasian  Residence: Suburban Pennsylvania   Background: The patient is a 9-year-old Caucasian male residing in suburban Pennsylvania. He lives with his parents and a younger sister  attends elementary school  and his hobbies include playing soccer at school. There is no indication of substance abuse or environmental hazards. He is up-to-date on all childhood immunizations.   Medical History: Pregnancy and birth were reported as uneventful by the mother. Developmental history is consistent with the appropriate growth and developmental milestones for his age.   The patient has no history of chronic diseases  hospitalizations  surgeries  or psychiatric disorders. No known allergies  currently not taking any medications. The patient follows a balanced diet as per pediatric recommendations and indulges in regular physical activities. There's no history of genetic conditions or heart disease in the patient's family.  Present Issue:  The patient was initially presented to the pediatrician for routine physical examination where an innocent heart murmur was detected. He was asymptomatic  with no report of chest pain  cyanosis  exertional dyspnea  or syncope. Further testing was recommended to rule out any heart condition.   Investigations: An echocardiogram was performed in a pediatric cardiology center  which demonstrated a significant congenital heart defect  specifically a ventricular septal defect (VSD). This condition implies that there is a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart.   Given the diagnosis  other possible symptoms and aspects of the condition were explored. When specifically asked  parents did report episodes of the child getting tireder than his peers during physical activities  which was previously overlooked. No signs of clubbing or cyanosis were observed.   Management Plan: The patient was referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further management  including monitoring and potential surgical intervention. Parents were educated on the signs to monitor in case the defect causes issues such as failure to thrive  excessive sweating  or rapid breathing. Emphasize was made on periodic follow-up to assess for any progression of the disease. The school was also informed to ensure adequate rest periods during physical activities.  Overall  the patient continues to exhibit positive and normal social and cognitive development  and the congenital heart defect has not yet significantly impacted his lifestyle.  The purpose of this case is to highlight the importance of routine pediatrics check-ups that can aid in the early detection of congenital heart conditions  even in an asymptomatic child.
13,7,96,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial96,Title: Congenital Heart Disease in a 28-Year-Old Male with Down Syndrome and Congenital Hypothyroidism  Patient Profile: The patient is a 28-year-old Caucasian male  born with Down syndrome and congenital hypothyroidism  currently residing in Boston  Massachusetts. He is unemployed  single  non-smoker  and non-alcoholic. He maintains a sedentary lifestyle and is predominantly dependent on his parents for daily activities.  Past medical history: The patient's birth was complicated by a pre-diagnosed case of Down syndrome and hypothyroidism. Prenatal testing indicated trisomy 21  which led to a birth via cesarean section on the 38th week. Neonatal testing confirmed Down Syndrome and also identified congenital hypothyroidism. The patient was promptly started on Levothyroxine and has been under medication since then.  Presenting concerns: The patient presented with increasing fatigue  shortness of breath  and lower limb edema - symptoms that his parents noticed over a couple of weeks. The patient's attending pediatrician  recognizing these symptoms as possible indicators of heart disease  referred him to our cardiology department for further evaluation.  Clinical findings: On examination  the patient appeared dyspneic and cyanotic with distended neck veins. Physical examination revealed a systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. The patient’s BMI was recorded as 28.3 putting him in the 'Overweight' category. An EKG showed right bundle branch block (RBBB) and chest X-ray indicated mild cardiomegaly.   Diagnostic assessment: Echocardiography revealed a large membranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) with bidirectional shunting and tricuspid atresia. Further  moderate pulmonary hypertension was also noted  making him a case of a complex congenital heart disease.  Therapeutic interventions: The patient was hospitalized and stabilized with diuretics  digoxin  and afterload reducers. Given the complexity of the case and worsening heart failure  he was referred to a tertiary center for the possibility of a heart-lung transplant or a series of palliative operations to redirect the flow of blood.  Follow up and outcomes: The patient remains stable on medical management as he awaits further treatment. He requires continuous medical care and monitoring and the need for advanced care in the future cannot be ruled out. The decision regarding surgery is still pending multidisciplinary consultation at the tertiary center.  Patient perspective: The patient's parents reported feeling stressed and anxious about his deteriorating condition  but were hopeful for a positive outcome from advanced surgical interventions. They expressed the desire to see him achieve a better quality of life and committed to supporting him throughout the process.  Informed consent: Patient’s parents  being his legal guardians  have provided informed consent for the case report to be published.

13,7,97,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial97,Patient Case Report  Demographics:  Subject is a 2-month-old Hispanic female infant  Medical History:  The infant was diagnosed at birth with a congenital heart disease  specifically  Tetralogy of Fallot  by echocardiography done as the infant presented with cyanosis upon crying and feeding  and a murmur was detected during a routine physical checkup.   Family medical history reveals that the patient’s paternal grandmother had rheumatic heart disease. The paternal side also has a history of type 2 diabetes. Both parents  aged 36 (male) and 33 (female)  are generally healthy with no known genetic disorders or previous children with congenital heart diseases. The mother maintained regular prenatal check-ups and reports having a normal pregnancy with no alcohol  drug usage  or reported exposure to environmental toxins.   Past Surgical History:  The infant has not undergone any previous surgeries.  Medications:  The patient is currently on Furosemide (Lasix) to control her heart failure symptoms and prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis.  Social History:  The infant is currently being breastfed and lives with both her parents and a 3-year-old sibling in a non-smoking residence.  Physical Examination: Physical examination revealed a weight of 5.3kg  which places her at the 25th percentile for her age  indicating a possible failure to thrive. However  her other physical developmental milestones were appropriate for her age.   Cardiovascular examination showed central cyanosis and a clubbing of the fingers. There was also a palpable thrill at the left sternal border and a RUSB systolic murmur.  Diagnostic Assessment:  A repeat echocardiogram confirmed the initial diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  showing a large ventricular septal defect  right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (infundibular stenosis)  overriding of the aorta  and right ventricular hypertrophy.  Plan:  Currently  the plan is for the infant to undergo corrective surgery  total repair of Tetralogy of Fallot  around 6 months of age. Meanwhile  the infant continues to be under close surveillance and medical therapy. Genetic counselling for the parents has also been recommended due to the rare possibility of an underlying genetic cause. The anticipated prognosis  with early surgical intervention  is relatively optimistic. Frequent follow-ups will be required throughout childhood and into adulthood. Monitoring of growth  development  and nutritional status in addition to serial echocardiograms will also form a part of follow-ups. 
13,7,98,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial98,"Title: Isolated Congenital Coronary Artery Fistula in a 62-Year-Old Female: A Rare Manifestation   Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian female presented to the hospital's Cardiology department with persistent atypical chest pain. She is a nonsmoker  with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia and no known allergies. Her lifestyle is fairly sedentary  and she leads an independent life. The patient has no family history of congenital heart disease.  Presenting Symptoms and Clinical Findings:  The patient's enduring discomfort  described as a feeling of """"pressure"""" present intermittently for the last six months  became constant two days before her presentation. The discomfort was unrelated to exertion or meal times but increased slightly laying flat. This was accompanied by occasional episodes of breathlessness. On examination  the patient had normal breath sounds  and a soft continuous murmur was audible in the left 5th intercostal space along the midclavicular line. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable.   Investigations:  Resting EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with no ST-wave changes. A Transthoracic Echocardiogram showed normal left and right ventricular size and function but a small unexplained color flow near the mitral valve.  Due to inconclusive findings  a Coronary Angiogram was performed resulting in the discovery of a congenital coronary artery fistula (CAF) originating from the proximal left circumflex artery and draining into the left atrium. Additional evaluations with Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) confirmed the anatomical details of the CAF.   Assessment:  The patient was diagnosed with isolated congenital coronary artery fistula  a rare form of congenital heart disease. Only a single coronary artery was involved  and no other congenital heart abnormalities were observed.  Management:   Given the patient's age  potential risks associated with surgical correction and lack of other typical symptoms such as palpitations or signs of heart failure  conservative management with close follow-up was recommended. Aggravating factors  such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia  were addressed with lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy (statins and ACE inhibitors). Prophylaxis against endocarditis was also recommended for any procedures potentially causing bacteremia.   The patient's chest discomfort and shortness of breath improved with pharmacotherapy  and no new symptom has arisen in the six-month follow-up.  Conclusion:   This case underscores the importance of recognizing rare congenital heart anomalies like isolated CAF in adults  even in the presence of seemingly unrelated symptoms. Consideration of a broad differential diagnosis  extensive evaluation with high-level imaging  and individualized risk-benefit analysis are crucial to optimize patient outcomes. "
13,7,99,diagnosis13-prompt7-trial99,"Title: Congenital Heart Disease in a 16-year-old Male  Introduction: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) represents a significant health concern globally and continues to be a leading cause of infantile morbidity and mortality. This report is an instance of a 16-year-old male diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a complex congenital heart disease involving four anatomical anomalies of the heart.  Patient Information: A 16-year-old African-American male was brought to the clinic showing symptoms like cyanosis  fatigue  frequent fainting spells  and rapid heart rate. Born in rural Louisiana  USA  the patient is the eldest among three children in his family with no prior familial history of congenital heart anomalies.  Clinical Findings: The patient presented with elevated jugular venous pulse  clubbing of fingers  and central cyanosis. His SpO2 level on room air was 78%. The initial chest X-ray showed a """"boot-shaped"""" heart  suggestive of Tetralogy of Fallot. Echocardiography confirmed the findings and demonstrated the presence of a large ventricular septal defect  right ventricular hypertrophy  pulmonary stenosis  and an overriding aorta.  Therapuetic Interventions: Surgical repair was recommended to the patient and his family. Complete repair surgery was executed  involving closure of the ventricular septal defect and relief of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.  Follow up and Outcome: The patient showed significant improvement post-surgery. Three months after the surgery  echo findings confirmed the successful closure of the ventricular septal defect and no significant residual stenosis. Now after a year of surgery  he has satisfactorily returned to normal routine activities with occasional minor dyspnea reported upon extreme exertion.   Discussion: The case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of CHD in a symptomatic adolescent through clinical and echocardiographic evaluations. Surgical intervention as in this case  provides considerable relief from the symptoms and significantly improves the overall quality of life.  Conclusion: This case report underlines the efficacy of surgical treatment in a complex congenital heart disease. It depicts the necessity for continuous cardiac health education and awareness about early interventions in such affected patients to ensure improved quality of life and longevity."

13,9,1,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial1,Patient Profile: Patient X is a 5-year-old female child of Asian ethnicity  residing in a suburban community. She was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect at birth  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot.  Past Medical History: The patient was diagnosed in the neonatal period following the identification of a heart murmur during a routine check-up. In the first year of life  she underwent a successful complete surgical repair. Post-operatively  the child remained stable with no significant cardiac issues. She did  however  experience common pediatric ailments such as viral upper respiratory infections and minor skin abrasions but without any major complications.  Family History: Family history indicates a paternal grandmother with rheumatic heart disease. However  there is no history of any congenital heart disease or early cardiac death within the family. Both parents are healthy  and the patient has a 7-year-old healthy sibling.  Clinical Observation: The patient presents with no cyanosis or dyspnea. Her growth is consistent with her age  and she engages in age-appropriate activities. Periodic echocardiograms show no significant residual defects.  Treatment: She is on prophylactic penicillin due to the history of rheumatic heart disease in the family and takes a daily multivitamin supplement. She reportedly tolerates her medication well.  Plan: The patient will continue her prophylactic antibiotics as well as her multivitamin supplement. She is instructed to exist under the care of her pediatric cardiologist with routine monitoring every six months including a full physical exam and echocardiogram.  Provisional Discussion: Considering the patient's age  her very active life and the absence of perceptible symptoms  her prognosis appears favorable. However  it's important to continue monitoring her heart function regularly for any sign of potential issues. As she continues to age and becomes more physically active  potential stress on her heart will be a key consideration.  Patient Education: The patient's parents are committed to her health and understand the importance of regular screenings. They have been briefed about symptoms of potential heart issues to watch out for such as fatigue  shortness of breath  and fainting spells. They understand the potential for further surgical intervention if her symptoms significantly worsen or demonstrate diminished heart function.  In Conclusion: Congenital heart disease  although challenging  can be managed effectively via both surgical intervention and ongoing health surveillance. In this patient's case  early diagnosis and treatment have allowed her to lead a fairly normal childhood to this point. Her prognosis is largely dependent on early detection of complications and timely interventions when necessary.
13,9,2,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial2,Case Presentation:  Patient Profile:  The patient is a two-month-old female infant  named Sophia  born to a Caucasian couple. She was born full term with a birth weight of 3.2kg. The couple resides in Seattle  Washington and both work in mid-level management positions. The couple has a four-year-old son who is in good health. There is no known consanguinity in the family. Sophia is their second child  and there are no reports of miscarriage  stillbirth  or voluntary termination of pregnancy in the mother's obstetric history.  Presentation:  Sophia has been generally healthy since birth with satisfactory growth and development. Her mother recently started to note that Sophia became sweaty and breathless during feeds. She also noticed increased effort in Sophia's breathing and frequent episodes of restlessness and difficulty sleeping. These symptoms raised concern and she brought Sophia in for examination.  Examination:  On physical examination  she was found to be tachypneic and slightly cyanotic. The cyanotic spells primarily occurred during crying and feeding. There were no signs of failure to thrive  her weight was satisfactory and she was alert. On auscultation  a continuous machine-like murmur was noted.  Lab tests and imaging:  Subsequent echocardiograph testing confirmed the diagnosis of Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)  a form of Congenital Heart Disease. Additionally  her Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left ventricle hypertrophy and a chest X-ray demonstrated her heart to be of normal size with slightly increased pulmonary vascular markings.  Family History:  On further exploration of the family history  although there is no known history of congenital heart disease  the patient’s maternal grandmother had suffered from rheumatic heart disease. Also  the maternal aunt had a child born with a cleft palate. This family history could indicate a potential inherited chromosomal abnormality or history of maternal autoimmune disease.  Plan:  The consulting pediatric cardiologist suggested that the PDA should close on its own and advised for close follow up. However  if required  surgical intervention in the form of coil embolisation or surgical ligation might be considered. The family was provided with education regarding the management and prognosis of PDA. In addition  due to her family history  genetic counseling was recommended.  This case of Sophia puts light on PDA  a type of congenital heart disease. Timely diagnosis and management of PDA is essential to prevent complications like congestive heart failure  endarteritis  and pulmonary hypertension.
13,9,3,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial3,Patient Presentation:  Patient's Initials: A.S.  Age: 6 months  Sex: Male   Race: Caucasian  Presenting Problem:  A.S.  a 6-month-old male  was brought to the hospital by his parents due to concerns about his rapid breathing  consistent fatigue  and poor feeding habits.  Past Medical History:  A.S.'s prenatal period was uneventful  and he was born via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 29-year-old G2P2 mother. His development milestones were reportedly normal as per his age. His immunizations are up-to-date. No previous hospitalizations  surgery  or severe illnesses reported.  Family History:  His father  aged 31  and mother  aged 29  are both healthy without any crucial medical conditions. A.S. has a sister aged two years without any considerable health problems. There is no family history of congenital heart disease or other genetic disorders.   Clinical Examination:  Physical examination revealed tachypnea and profuse sweating  particularly during feeds. Furthermore  A.S. had slight peripheral cyanosis and moderate clubbing. Heart examination disclosed a loud palpable P2  a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border  and a diastolic rumble at the apex.  Diagnosis:  A.S. was diagnosed with a congenital heart disorder specifically the presence of a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) based on his family physician's clinical observations and confirmed through an echocardiogram. Further cardiac investigations showed Eisenmenger syndrome.  Plan:  The immediate plan for A.S includes initiating appropriate treatment to manage symptoms and support cardiovascular function. Medication therapies including diuretics and Digoxin have been prescribed initially. Dietary management was discussed to support optimal growth. The parents have been advised about the long-term potential of cardiac surgery to correct the VSD and are referred to a pediatric cardiac surgeon for further evaluation and planning.  Discussion:  Heart defects such as VSD are quite common in children and can lead to conditions such as Eisenmenger syndrome if not treated properly. In such cases where the defect is large  management usually includes a combination of medication and surgery. Given A.S.'s age  the management plan is aggressive to avoid further complications from occurring.  Learning Points:  This case illustrates the importance of early identification and management of congenital heart defects such as VSD to prevent severe complications. The long-term management of these conditions often involves both medication and surgical intervention. The role of family physicians in identifying these conditions early  ensuring appropriate referral for specialist management  and supporting the family through the process is imperative.
13,9,4,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial4,Patient Presentation:  Patient Name: Smith. C.  Age: 6 Months Background: Caucasian Sex: Male  Presenting Issue:   Smith C is a 6-month-old male infant presenting recurrent respiratory infections  mild cyanosis and poor feeding behavior. He was referred following a suspicion of a heart murmur during a routine check-up by the pediatrician. Prior to the referral  Smith's parents mentioned that he seemed less active compared to other babies his age and was not gaining weight at a healthy rate.  Past Medical History:  Smith has experienced regular bouts of pneumonia ever since birth  often accompanied by rapid breathing and poor feeding. His growth has been slow and steady  but he has been lagging behind the expected weight and height percentiles for his age group.  Family History:   There is a known history of congenital heart disease on Smith's father's side. Smith’s father was diagnosed with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) in childhood  which required surgical intervention.   Treatment & Examination:  Upon examination  differential cyanosis and loud heartbeat were observed. Further  Echocardiogram confirmed a diagnosis of congenital heart disease  with a patent ductus arteriosus and a right-to-left shunt.   Given his overall health situation and the severity of his symptoms  Smith will likely need a combination of surgical treatment and long-term medical management. A multidisciplinary team including a pediatric cardiologist  cardiologist  and a pediatric nurse will be involved in Smith’s care and ongoing monitoring.  Discussion:  Smith is young  which increases the risk associated with surgical treatments for congenital heart disease. Further  his constant battles with pneumonia could complicate recovery post-surgery. Thus  the decision for intervention requires careful consideration of all these factors.  Parents have been informed about the situation and the potential options for treatment. Smith’s continuing symptoms like poor feeding  lack of growth  and regular upper respiratory tract infections also suggest that early intervention might be most beneficial for him.  In conclusion  Smith's case indicates a serious congenital heart disease which needs immediate attention. He will need constant monitoring and regular follow-ups even after corrective surgery. It will be crucial to keep his parents informed and involved in his care  seeing as their contribution to his care will be pivotal in his treatment and recovery.
13,9,5,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial5,Patient Presentation  Patient Information: Male  6 years old  Caucasian.  Presenting Complaint: Fatigue during physical activities  shortness of breath  frequent respiratory infections  and undue paleness.  Past Medical History: Frequent respiratory infection during the first 5 years of life. Born full-term without any complications. The neonatal period was uneventful except for minor respiratory issues.  Complete Demographics: The patient lives with his biological parents and older sister in a suburban community. They are middle-income earners with a stable home environment. The patient is currently in kindergarten.  Family History: There is no known family history of congenital heart disease. Both parents are healthy  non-smokers  and have no known medical conditions. The older sister  age 10  has asthma but is otherwise healthy.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a reduced heart rate and a cardiac murmur. Patient showed signs of breathlessness  fatigue  and occasional bouts of rapid breathing. Cyanosis is not present  but the patient was noticeably pale with a reduced hemoglobin count. General growth and developmental milestones are at par with his age.  Diagnostic Assessment: Echocardiography performed showed a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) suggesting congenital heart disease. Follow-up tests confirmed the presence of a sizable hole in the ventricular septa leading to the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.  Planned Management: Open-heart surgery is being considered to close the VSD because of the size of the defect. While awaiting surgery  the patient will be closely monitored and will be placed on medication to help control his symptoms.  Discussion: Congenital heart disease  particularly VSD  is one of the most common birth defects. While small VSDs can close on their own  larger defects like in this patient’s case require surgical intervention. Early intervention is crucial to prevent complications such as pulmonary hypertension or stroke  and to improve the patient's long-term prognosis.  Patient Education: The parents are educated about the condition and the need for surgery. They were also taught to possible signs of heart failure including rapid breathing  decreased feeding  or excessive sweating. They are advised to restrict the child's strenuous activities until after successful treatment.   Conclusion: A multidisciplinary approach employing a pediatric cardiologist  cardiac surgeon  and pediatric nurses will be integral in the successful management of this patient's condition. With the right therapy and supportive measures  prognosis for VSD patients is generally promising. After the surgery  ongoing follow-ups and continuous patient monitoring are imperative for the patient’s wellbeing.
13,9,6,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial6,Patient Profile:  Name: Jane Doe Age: 6 months old Sex: Female Race: Caucasian Parents: First-degree relatives  both in their early 30s  Medical History: Miss Jane Doe was born with Tricuspid Atresia  a form of congenital heart disease that was diagnosed postnatally during routine newborn screening. Our young patient was noticed to have cyanosis  which led to further diagnostic procedures.  Family History: There is no known family history of congenital heart disease  stroke or sudden cardiac death. Both parents are non-smokers and have no history of drug or alcohol abuse. The pregnancy was uncomplicated  with prenatal care and screening appearing normal. This is the couple's first child.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination at 1 week of age revealed cyanosis  particularly of the lips and fingertips. No dysmorphic features were identified. Her vitals at the time of evaluation at our hospital revealed a respiratory rate of 45 breaths per minute  heart rate of 145 beats per minute  oxygen saturation of 81% on room air  and systemic blood pressure of 78/46 mm Hg.  Diagnostic Methods and Results: An echocardiogram revealed diagnosis of Tricuspid Atresia  a condition in which the tricuspid valve — the valve that ensures blood flows from the upper right chamber of the heart to the lower right chamber — doesn't form. As a result  the right side of Jane's heart is underdeveloped  leading to low oxygen saturation.  Treatment Plan: Jane was scheduled for surgery  known as the Blalock–Taussig shunt  to create a passage for blood to reach the lungs. This was done at 1 month of age. The plan moving forward is to do a complete repair  involving two additional procedures. In the interim  we will continue to carefully monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and stability.  Summary: Although this case is unfortunate for the family  through prompt diagnosis and commencement of surgical intervention  the prognosis is positive. Jane has displayed satisfactory recovery and adaptation post first surgery. Significantly  the family exhibits understanding of the condition and the treatment protocol  demonstrating diligent compliance which offers an optimistic outlook for Miss Doe's long-term outcome.   The treating team will continue to monitor the baby and provide ongoing support and education to the family throughout treatment. This case underlines the significance of regular prenatal screening and examinations for early detection of congenital heart disease in newborns.
13,9,7,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial7,Patient Information: The patient is a four-year-old male  of African-American descent. His immediate family resides in Atlanta  Georgia. He was referred to our hospital due to frequent episodes of fatigue and breathlessness.   Past Medical History: Born full term with no immediate complications  he was initially breastfed before weaning onto formula and then solids with no issues. From the age of 3  he was observed to have a slower growth curve compared to his peers  increasing fatigue  and decreased appetite.   Family History: The patient's maternal uncle was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in his late teens  and his paternal grandmother had a congenital heart defect  specifically a ventricular septal defect  which was surgically corrected in her infancy.  Presenting Symptoms: He presented with extreme breathlessness after physical activities  decreased appetite  and he was growing lesser compared to his peers. Upon examination  a heart murmur was noted.  Investigations and Diagnosis: An echocardiogram was ordered  which revealed a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)  hence confirming a diagnosis of congenital heart disease. The VSD was large enough to cause significant shunting from the left to the right ventricle which was likely causing his symptoms of breathlessness and poor growth.  Treatment & Plan: We referred the patient to a pediatric cardiologist for a further evaluation and suggested that the parents consider surgical correction of the VSD due to its large size and the significant symptomatology of the patient. Early intervention at this age can prevent serious complications such as pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger's syndrome. The patient's family was also educated about the congenital nature of the condition and its potential appearance in future offspring.  Conclusion: Congenital heart disease cases like these highlight the importance of early detection and intervention to ensure the growth and development of the child are not hindered. Genetic counseling may be beneficial for the family due to the familial links seen with the condition.

Physical Examination:  On examination  one-month-old male appeared acyanotic at rest with slightly increased respiratory rate and signs of mild distress during episodes of cyanosis. Other physical findings include a loud  harsh murmur heard near the left upper sternal border of the heart.  Investigations:  Chest X-Ray revealed an enlarged heart suggestive of cardiac pathology. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed abnormal heart rhythms. The infant was subjected to an echocardiogram  which indicated a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart disease.  Plan:   1. Consultation with pediatric cardiologist and pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon to decide the best possible treatment approach. 2. Immediate management of the episodes of cyanosis  known as """"tet spells """" by placing the child in a knee-chest position and administering oxygen. Intravenous fluids may be needed as well. 3. Surgical repair of the heart defect (likely within the first year of life) to improve circulation and correct the defects.  4. Regular follow-ups after surgery to monitor growth  development  and function of the repaired heart.  Education and Counseling:  Parents were informed about the diagnosis and possible outcomes. They were educated about ways to manage """"tet spells"""" at home  the importance of regular follow-up appointments  and possible complications.  The case demonstrates congenital heart disease in infants  emphasizing the importance of early recognition of symptoms  the need for targeted diagnostics  and the efficacy of surgical intervention."
13,9,9,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial9,Patient's Information:   A four-year-old male of Hispanic ethnicity came to our attention due to fatigue  persistent cough with sputum  and exposure to cold environments easily causing the blueness of lips and fingers. He has been putting on less weight in comparison to other children of his age. The onset of symptoms was noted soon after birth  but the severity and frequency have increased over time.   Past Medical History:   Upon birth  the child was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect known as Tetralogy of Fallot  which includes four heart defects: a ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta. This diagnosis explained the early cyanosis (blue skin coloring due to inadequate oxygen in the blood) noticed by the parents and hospital staff. Cardiac surgery was suggested upon stabilization of the child's condition  but the family moved out of state shortly after birth and failed to follow up with pediatric cardiology.   Family History:   The family history revealed a pattern of heart disease in the family. The patient’s maternal grandmother underwent heart surgery at the age of 60  and his uncle died prematurely at 40 due to an unspecified congenital heart disease. Both parents  however  are apparently fit and healthy. It is also worth mentioning that the parents are first cousins. There is no significant history of diabetes  hypertension  or any other systemic disease within the family.  Physical and Clinical Findings:   Physical examination revealed a clubbing of fingers  bluish skin (cyanosis)  especially the lips and digits  and the child was noted to be smaller in size compared to average standards. Chest examination revealed a loud harsh quality systolic ejection murmur best heard in the left upper sternal border. The electrocardiogram showed right ventricular hypertrophy and the chest X-ray demonstrated both a boot-shaped heart and lung oligemia  supporting the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot.   Ongoing Management and Plans:   The case was discussed with a pediatric cardiologist for 'Tet spell' management and the possibility of complete surgical repair. The cardiac surgeon has agreed to place the child on the waiting list for surgery. Meanwhile  keeping in mind the family history  genetic counseling was also provided to the parents  and they have been informed of the 3-4% risk of heart defects in future pregnancies. They have also been instructed to prioritize regular follow-ups post-surgery.   Prognosis:   With surgery  most children who have Tetralogy of Fallot live relatively normal lives  though they'll need life-long medical care and may have restrictions on exercise. Those who have had surgery for Tetralogy of Fallot may need additional surgery or procedures.
13,9,10,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial10,Patient Identification: A nine-month-old male infant.  Demographics: The patient hails from a middle-class Caucasian family located in suburban New York.  Presenting Problem: The patient was brought to the hospital by his parents due to repeated episodes of shortness of breath  profuse sweating  and poor feeding. Upon further examination  a heart murmur was heard which led to a more comprehensive diagnostic investigation.  Past Medical History: The patient was born at full term with routine prenatal care; however  his birth weight was lower than average. There was no history of immediate postnatal complications  and no prior hospitalizations. Vaccinations are up to date.  Family History: There is no history of congenital heart diseases  early heart diseases or sudden death in the family. The patient’s other sibling  a healthy three-year-old  has no known medical conditions.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the infant was found to be cyanotic. A heart murmur was detected during the cardiac examination. His oxygen saturation levels were found to be lower than normal.  Diagnostic Testing: An echocardiogram was performed which revealed a large Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). The chest X-ray showed an enlarged heart and increased pulmonary vascular markings. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was abnormal  pointing towards possible heart disease.  Diagnosis: Based on the clinical findings and diagnostic imaging  the infant was diagnosed with congenital heart disease  specifically a large Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD).  Treatment Plan: Given the infant's clinical condition and large size of the VSD  surgical intervention was the recommended option. However  prior to the surgery  it was decided to manage the patient’s condition with medications to help lessen the symptoms and improve his overall heart function.  Prognosis: If the surgery is successful  the prognosis is quite good and the patient is likely to live a normal life. Regular follow-ups with a cardiologist will be critical to monitor the patient's overall health and heart function.  Psychosocial Considerations: Explaining the diagnosis and need for surgery to the parents  and dealing with their ensuing anxiety and fear  requires empathy and clear communication. Appropriate counseling services will be provided. They will be assured of comprehensive care and support to help them transition through this difficult time.
13,9,11,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial11,Case Presentation: Congenital Heart Disease  Demographics: 2-year-old Hispanic male named Jose  Presenting Complaint: Persistent fatigue  poor feeding  and rapid breathing during feeding  Past Medical History: Full-term baby  normal birth weight (3.5 kg)  breastfeeding well until the onset of symptoms at 6 months. Subject to regular immunizations with no noted reactions  and no prior hospitalizations or surgeries.  Family History: No known congenital heart diseases or inherited disorders. The mother  a 28-year-old woman  enjoyed a healthy pregnancy without any complications. Father  a 30-year-old man  is healthy. The patient has one 5-year-old sister who has no health issues. There has been no recorded sudden death  hypertension  diabetes  or high cholesterol on both the maternal and paternal sides of the family.  Living Environment: Lives with both parents and sibling. No exposure to tobacco or alcohol. No travel history outside their hometown of San Diego.   History of Present Illness: Jose started to exhibit signs of fatigue  poor feeding  and rapid breathing during feeding around the age of 6 months. His parents also noted a slower weight gain compared to his sister at the same age. Despite frequent feeding  Jose appeared to be tired all the time and had difficulty keeping up with his feedings.   Physical Examination: Vital signs are within normal limits. The patient was afebrile and his growth parameters were below standard percentiles for his age. Chest examination revealed a loud  harsh holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. Other systems did not reveal any abnormality. He weighed less than average for his age group and appeared malnourished.   Investigations: Electrocardiogram showed right ventricular hypertrophy and chest X-ray showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette consistent with cardiomegaly. An echocardiogram revealed a large defect in the ventricular septum causing an overload of blood in the lungs (ventricular septal defect - VSD).  Diagnosis: Congenital Heart Disease  specifically a large Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD).  Treatment: After the diagnosis  the child was referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further management. Due to the large size of the VSD and the child's symptoms  surgical intervention was recommended.   Discussion: Ventricular Septal Defect is one of the most common forms of congenital heart disease  representing about 30-35% of all cases. It involves one or more holes in the wall that separates the right and left ventricles of the heart. Symptoms tend to appear in the first few weeks or months of a child's life. Without proper treatment  this disease can lead to serious complications like heart failure.  Follow-up Plan: Regular postoperative assessments  monitoring of growth and development  as well as ongoing testing for cardiac function  will be necessary to ensure that the child's heart is functioning normally after the procedure. Any symptoms such as poor feeding  rapid breathing  or poor weight gain would require immediate medical attention.
13,9,12,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial12,"Patient Information:   Patient ABC is a 9-month old female of African American descent who was diagnosed with congenital heart disease at birth.   Demographics:   The patient resides with both parents in an urban residential setting in Chicago  Illinois. Both parents are active in the child's life and are accessing all possible resources to ensure the highest possible quality of life for their daughter.  Past Medical History:  ABC was diagnosed at birth with Tetralogy of Fallot (a form of congenital heart disease) after a murmur was detected during a routine newborn exam. The patient has been under the care of a team of pediatric cardiologists since diagnosis. She underwent successful corrective surgery at six months of age  but due to the complexity of her condition  she continues to require long-term follow-up care. Beyond her heart disorder  ABC's medical history has been unremarkable.   Family Medical History:  The biological mother  26 years old  is generally healthy with a history of mild asthma. The biological father  28 years old  suffers from Type 1 Diabetes. The couple has one older child  a 4-year-old boy  who is healthy with no known medical conditions. There is no known family history of congenital heart conditions  genetic disorders  or other serious illnesses.   Current Health Status:  ABC is currently stable with her condition. Since the surgical correction  she has exhibited improved feeding  weight gain  and physical activity levels. Her development milestones are all normal for her age. Her body color has returned to normal  and she is no longer exhibiting """"blue baby syndrome"""" which was found pre-operatively due to her heart condition. Her pediatric cardiologist is optimistic about her prognosis but maintains a close watch on her growth and development to ensure any arising issues can be promptly managed.  Healthcare Strategy:  The patient's healthcare plan involves regular follow-ups with her cardiologist to monitor her heart function. As she grows  further interventions may be required to ensure that the repairs made to her heart continue to serve her changing body effectively. Additionally  she receives ongoing nutrition support to promote optimal growth and development  owing to her condition which can sometimes impact normal growth rates. As she continues to thrive post-surgery  her healthcare team has increased optimism about her long-term prognosis.  In conclusion  ABC is a 9-month-old girl with a diagnosis of congenital heart disease. Despite these challenges  she is thriving developmentally  thanks to early intervention  high-quality medical care  and a loving and supportive family environment. The healthcare plan for ABC is set to regularly monitor her condition and growth  ensuring to handle promptly any arising issues  delivering her a quality life as she grows. "
13,9,13,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial13,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe is a 25-year-old Asian male who comes from a family of five. He was recently diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a common type of congenital heart disease (CHD). He was brought into the clinic by his elder sister due to complaints of fatigue and blue-tinged skin - a condition referred to as cyanosis. His vital signs upon arrival were: temperature - 98.6F; blood pressure - 120/80; pulse - 90 bpm; and respiratory rate - 20 breaths/minute.  Past Medical History: John’s past medical history is significant for several bouts of pneumonia and recurrent acute bronchitis during childhood. He was also diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia at the age of 8. For his anemia  his primary physician prescribed iron supplements and encouraged a diet rich in iron. In high school  John was noted to have difficulty participating in sports due to shortness of breath and episode of fainting.   Family History: John's family history includes a father who died from myocardial infarction at the age of 56 and a mother currently receiving treatment for Type II diabetes. John has two siblings  both in good health save for a number of allergies. His paternal grandmother also suffered from a heart condition but the specifics were unknown.  Further Investigations: A chest x-ray showed a characteristic """"boot-shaped"""" heart  a typical sign of Tetralogy of Fallot. An echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis; revealing the four defects typical of this condition - ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta. Blood tests also showed a significantly increased amount of circulating red blood cells (polycythemia)  a condition often seen in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot due to chronic hypoxia leading to increased erythropoiesis.  Clinical Course: John was referred to a cardiologist for further management. The cyanosis  along with the polycythemia  suggests chronic hypoxia  and his complaints of fatigue and fainting indicate that his body isn't getting the amount of oxygen it needs  which is likely impairing his quality of life. The cardiologist will consider when surgery should be scheduled  as surgical repair is the definitive treatment for Tetralogy of Fallot.  In conclusion  it is probable that John's congenital heart condition  Tetralogy of Fallot  remained undiagnosed during childhood due to lack of specific diagnostic criteria. Prompt referral to a cardiologist after diagnosis will ensure a definitive treatment plan that aims to increase John’s quality of life."
13,9,14,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial14,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Ethan James  is a six-month-old Caucasian male  diagnosed with congenicital heart disease (CHD). Born prematurely at 32 weeks  he showed initial symptoms of respiratory distress and difficulty feeding immediately after birth. The diagnostic test was conducted when he was admitted in neonatal intensive care unit.   Ethan's parents first noted abnormalities when a regular prenatal ultrasound revealed structural issues with Ethan's heart. Postnatal echocardiography shortly after his birth confirmed the suspicions and Ethan was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of CHD that comprises various heart defects.  Medical History:  Ethan’s major health issues are congenital and linked to his heart. Being premature  he did have breathing difficulties and required support but was weaned off successfully. His feeding difficulties have been managed through a special feeding tube  introduced percutaneously. He has had recurrent respiratory infections requiring hospitalization.  Family History:  Both of Ethan’s parents have no known history of easy bruising or prolonged bleeding. His father  aged 32 years  is a non-smoker and maintains an active lifestyle; his mother  aged 30 years  has no adverse health conditions either. None of them have any history of heart disease.  However  CHD seemed to run on Ethan's maternal side  as his mother’s younger brother also had a CHD  which was surgically corrected in infancy. His maternal grandparents are both still alive without any major health issues.  Surgical History:  Due to severe cyanotic episodes  Ethan underwent a staged repair procedure when he was two months old  involving a Blalock-Taussig shunt placement. The procedure helped to increase pulmonary blood flow thus reducing the severity of his symptoms.   Hospitalizations:  Ethan has been hospitalized multiple times due to bouts of pneumonia and a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection  all requiring admission into intensive care for severe respiratory distress syndrome.  Present Status:  Ethan is currently due for a follow-up cardiac catheter procedure in the next month. He is frequently monitored by the outpatient pediatric cardiology department at our hospital.  In conclusion: Since Ethan's circumstances include a family history of CHD along with a preliminary diagnosis during prenatal screenings  this indicates a genetic predisposition. Therefore  more genetic testing to explore possible mutations symbolizing inherited forms of CHD might be beneficial. At this stage  Ethan’s parents are counseled frequently about his condition  available treatment options and prognosis. 
13,9,15,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial15,"Patient Case Presentation  Patient Details ------------ Name: Jane Doe   Age: 5-year-old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting Complaint ------------------ Jane was referred to the cardiology clinic after her pediatrician noted a heart murmur during a routine examination. She has not complained of any symptoms and her mother says that she is very active  has normal growth and development milestones for her age  and has not had any major illnesses.   Previous Medical History --------------------- Jane was delivered full term by cesarean section and her birth was uneventful  with normal Apgar scores. According to her records  she has had all her vaccinations and has been on regular pediatric reviews. Her previous health background has been generally unremarkable. She has never been hospitalized for any major illness.   Family History -------------- Jane has one older brother  who is in good health. Both of her parents are alive  the father has hypertension and the mother is healthy without any diagnosed significant medical conditions. There is no known family history of congenital heart disease  early heart disease  or sudden cardiac death.  Clinical Examination Findings ------------------------- Jane’s vital signs were within normal limits. On auscultation  a continuous """"machinery"""" murmur was noted  which is suggestive of Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)  a type of congenital heart disease. Other systemic examinations were normal.  Investigations -------------- An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm. The chest X-ray showed a mildly enlarged heart with increased pulmonary vascular markings. Echocardiography examination revealed a moderate size patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with left to right shunt.  Diagnosis ------------ Jane was diagnosed with congenital heart disease  specifically Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA).   Management Plan ------------------ Given her age and the hemodynamically significant size of the PDA  the decision was made to proceed with the surgical closure of the PDA. The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with Jane's parents  who agreed to proceed. Jane was referred to a pediatric heart surgeon for further management. After the successful closure of PDA  routine follow-ups with the cardiology clinic were planned.  Conclusion ------------ Early detection of congenital heart disease like PDA is crucial to hinder progression and prevent potential comorbidities. Jane is fortunately asymptomatic probably due to her relatively small PDA size and early age of detection. Given her current health status  she has a positive prognosis with successful closure of the PDA."
13,9,16,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial16,Patient Presentation:  The patient  a 10-month-old Caucasian male  has been diagnosed with congenital heart disease  specifically a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The infant was brought to the hospital presenting with symptoms including poor weight gain  fast breathing  excessive sweating  and continuous crying  mainly during feedings.  Past Medical History: The baby was born full term with no immediate complications. As an infant  he had persistent chest infections and exhibited difficulty in feeding. His mother noticed he appeared to tire quickly  sweat excessively  and experience shortness of breath during feedings.  Presenting Complaints: Upon examination  the child presented with poor weight gain (reaching only the 5th percentile for his age)  difficulty while feeding  and fatigue. His breathing rate was elevated at 60 breaths per minute  and he exhibited signs of significant respiratory distress  including intercostal retractions and nasal flaring.   Family History: There's no apparent family history of congenital heart disease  any heart diseases  or genetic disorders. Both parents are healthy  and the patient has a 3-year-old sister who is also healthy.  Clinical Assessment: On examination  a holosystolic murmur was heard on the left lower sternal border  hepatomegaly was noted  and there were signs of congestive heart failure. An Echocardiogram was ordered  which confirmed a sizeable VSD.  Differential Diagnosis: Considering the age of the patient and presenting symptoms  differentials could include other causes of failure to thrive like metabolic disorders  malnutrition  or chronic infection. Also  other forms of congenital heart diseases  like patent ductus arteriosus  atrial septal defect  or coarctation of the aorta  were considered.  Current Treatment: Upon confirming the diagnosis  the baby was started on diuretics to help manage heart failure symptoms  in addition to digoxin to help strengthen his heart contractions and control his heart rate. Surgery to close the VSD is being considered as the baby is symptomatic and there's a risk of heart failure.  Plan: Surgical management will be proceeded with if the defect does not close itself in the next few months and if the symptoms persist. The baby will require regular echocardiogram follow-up appointments to see if the size of the VSD is reducing. Nutrition consult has been recommended to assist with weight gain and growth.  Prognosis: With proper management and early intervention  children with VSD can lead entirely normal lives. In some cases  depending on the size of the VSD  it can close on its own without requiring surgery. For others  a simple surgical intervention is enough to correct the defect  allowing for normal growth and development.
13,9,17,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial17,Patient Presentation:  The patient  a two-month-old Hispanic male infant named Alejandro  was brought in by his parents for routine infant check-up. There is a report of frequent cyanotic spells when Alejandro feeds  marked by a mild blueness around the mouth. He can be consoled but seems to be prone to periods of exhaustion and increased work of breathing  evident by measurable tachypnea and irritability. Besides  he has poor weight gain despite being exclusively breastfed. Alejandro was born full-term with no immediate postpartum complications and had normal newborn screening tests.  Medical History:   Alejandro is a firstborn child to his 27-year-old mother and 28-year-old father. His prenatal care was uneventful  with no maternal illness  exposure  or medication history. He has an unremarkable neonatal course and has been exclusively breastfed since birth. His immunizations are up-to-date.  Family History:  Mother and father both have an unremarkable medical history aside from a paternal history of rheumatic heart disease. No known genetic conditions or congenital heart diseases were reported from either side of Alejandro's family.  Examination:   On physical examination  Alejandro was alert and active. His measurements were as follows: Weight at the 10th percentile  length at the 25 percentile  and head circumference at the 25th percentile for his age. His cardiovascular examination revealed a harsh 3/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard in the upper left sternal border. Pulses were equal bilaterally in the upper and lower extremities.  Management:   Given the physical findings and symptoms  it was suspected that Alejandro may have a congenital heart anomaly. An echocardiogram was ordered to confirm and further identify the specific anomaly.  Echocardiography:   The echocardiogram report indicated Tetralogy of Fallot  a combined congenital heart defect.   Conclusion:   Given Alejandro's cyanotic spells  identification of a heart murmur  and an echocardiogram showing findings consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot  Alejandro was definitively diagnosed with this form of congenital heart disease. The next steps for his management were discussed with his parents. This included the need for early surgical intervention and long-term follow-up with a cardiologist. 
13,9,18,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial18,"Patient Profile:   The patient is a six-month-old Asian male  born full-term via normal spontaneous delivery. The boy  who we will refer to as """"Aiden"""" for privacy protection  was born with a birth weight of 3.2 kilograms. He lives with his parents in suburban district. His mother is 28 years old and his father is 31; both are non-smokers  and there are no history of illicit drugs or alcohol consumption during pregnancy. His parents are healthy with no known genetic disorders or chronic diseases.   Past Medical History:  Aiden was a healthy baby at birth  but his mother reported that he began experiencing feeding difficulties  becoming easily fatigued and having rapid breathing during the second month. On his fourth month  he was diagnosed with Failure to Thrive due to his slow weight gain and a notable falling percentile in his growth chart. There is no known allergy and he is on iron supplements due to mild anemia noticed at 4 months. He has received standard immunizations appropriate for his age with no adverse reactions.  Presenting Complaints:  His parents brought him to the pediatrician due to his persistent cyanosis  particularly noticeable around his lips. In addition  Aiden has had noticeable difficulty in feeding  often with episodes of breathlessness also expressed an occurrence of frequent cold and cough over past two months. Main concern is his less weight gain than expected for his age.  Clinical Findings:  Upon physical examination  Aiden presented with cyanosis  clubbed fingers  dyspnea  chest retractions  and a harsh pan systolic murmur. Vitals show tachycardia and tachypnea with oxygen saturation at 85-90% on room air.   Diagnostic Assessment:  Further diagnostic examinations were initiated because of the consistent signs and symptoms of Congenital Heart Disease(CHD). A chest X-Ray showed a significant cardiomegaly. An echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis revealing a large Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)  overriding of the aorta above the ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis: a characteristic of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a kind of CHD.   Management:  Aiden was started on diuretics and was oxygen supplemented. He was referred to pediatric cardiologists to evaluate his candidacy for cardiac surgery  which is typically the definitive treatment for TOF.  Conclusion:  Despite being born full-term  Aiden’s TOF went undetected until he presented with delayed growth and noticeable symptoms. Early diagnosis  followed by surgical management  is crucial in managing patients like Aiden to prevent long-term complications and enhance quality of life. Southern Asian populations reportedly have a higher prevalence of TOF  which could be the basis for genetic predisposition in Aiden's case  suggesting that heightened screening procedures can be beneficial in these populations.

13,9,19,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial19,Patient Profile:  Name: Maria [Last Name] Sex: Female Age: 7 Months (DOB: August 2019) Race: Hispanic  Residence: Texas  USA  Medical Profile: Upon physical examination  Maria was noted to have an irregular heart rate and a distinctive heart murmur. Her clinical finding led to a referral to a pediatric cardiologist where further diagnostic evaluations were completed. Maria has been diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart defect that changes the normal flow of blood through the heart. Cyanosis  a symptom of Tetralogy of Fallot  was identified. The pediatric cardiologist has suggested and started initial therapeutic interventions  which include medication to reduce the symptom of cyanosis and potential surgery in the near future.   Past Medical History: Upon review  Maria's neonatal period was standard and uneventful. She hasn't had any major illnesses or hospitalizations. No prior surgeries or routine medication were noted. Maria had mild jaundice after birth but was managed suitably and recovered completely.   Family History: While interviewing her parents  it has been revealed that there is a limited family history of heart diseases. Maria’s mother had gestational diabetes but controlled it through diet and physical activity during her pregnancy. There were no maternal prenatal exposures to toxins  infections  or significant stresses. She was monitored regularly and all routine prenatal screenings and tests (like prenatal ultrasounds) were normal. However  Maria's paternal grandmother reportedly suffered from a heart condition in her late 60's.   Social and Environmental History: Both parents are non-smokers and banned smoking in their home. They live in a suburban neighborhood with no known environmental allergens or pollutants.  Assessment and Treatment Plan: Due to the congenital heart disease diagnosis  the multidisciplinary team has taken steps to alleviate her symptoms  providing her with the necessary medications. Maria is currently on a watchful waiting with regular cardiology consults and doing generally well with her medications. The team plans to conduct a comprehensive evaluation to tentatively consider surgical intervention when Maria gains more weight and strength. Moreover  Maria's family has been referred to a social worker for additional resources and support in coping with the diagnosis and potential surgical plan.  While her family is understandably distressed  they are cooperative and maintain clear communication with the medical team about Maria's condition. Support and updates are routinely provided to ensure Maria’s comprehensive care. The patient's prognosis will be re-evaluated regularly  ensuring her best interest and continuous quality of life.
13,9,20,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial20,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a three-month-old female infant of Asian descent  presenting with symptoms of breathlessness  fatigue  and poor weight gain since birth. Her residence is in an urban family unit in California  and she is the first child of non-consanguineous parents.  Past Medical History: The prenatal period was uneventful based on her mother's account. Delivery was a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery after a full term gestation  with the baby exhibiting good health post birth. However  parents observed the constant fatiguing and feeding difficulties  which perpetually persisted.  Presenting Complaints: Currently  the child showcases pallor  significantly decreased activity levels  and irregular feeding patterns. She takes prolonged periods to complete a feed  only to tire out midway  which has resulted in below-average weight gain. Cyanosis upon exertion (like crying spells) has been observed.  Family History: No significant family history of congenital heart defects or major congenital anomalies exists. Parents have no history of consanguinity. The maternal side has a history of diabetes but no significant findings from the paternal side. They lost a second baby due to unexplained reasons during the neonatal period.  Diagnostic Evaluations: Upon suspicion of congenital heart disease  an echocardiogram was conducted  revealing a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) - a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart. A chest X-ray revealed cardiac enlargement  indicating an increased cardiac workload. EKG presents signs of Bi-Ventricular Hypertrophy due to the increased stress on both ventricles.  Management: The management plan comprises both medical and  eventually  surgical intervention. The baby is currently on diuretics and Digoxin for the management of heart failure and has been advised tube feeding to ensure adequate nutrient intake.  Summarily  the patient’s consideration for surgical closure of VSD is under deliberation based on her progressing symptoms and poor weight gain trend. The timing and approach would be determined after periodic evaluation of her overall health status.  Discussion: Early detection of this congenital heart anomaly has helped in preempting potential pulmonary hypertension. However  the patient's lack of weight gain serves as a cause of concern and a challenge for surgical suitability. Medical management  nutritional build-up  and continual monitoring underspin the future course of action. It is crucial to financially and emotionally support the family during this challenging period through counseling and guidance.
13,9,21,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial21,"Patient Bio: Name: Baby Boy Avery  Age: 6 months  Race: Caucasian  Residence: Little Rock  Arkansas  USA  Case Presentation: Baby Avery  a 6-month-old male infant  presented with frequent episodes of breathlessness and fits of prolonged crying. The primary care pediatrician referred him to a cardiologist due to suspicions of a possible heart condition; excessive sweating  poor feed  and tiresome behavior after activities  which lead her concerned for the patient's well-being.  Medical History: Baby Avery was delivered at 39 weeks via a complication-free  vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 3.3Kg. His mother had regular prenatal visits and check-ups that indicated no signs of congenital abnormalities. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes  respectively. There was no record of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission  and his age-specific vaccinations are up to date.  Family History: There is a notable family history of congenital heart disease from Baby Avery's paternal side. His father had an atrial septal defect (ASD) that was surgically corrected during his early childhood. No other known genetic diseases or chronic illnesses are identified within his immediate family.  Current Examination: Baby Avery was active and reactive during the examination  but a careful physical examination revealed a distinctive heart murmur. His growth parameters were marginally low for his age  weight being in the 25th percentile and length in the 30th percentile for his age group.   Investigations: Echocardiography was performed due to his signs  symptoms  and family history which confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart disease.   Conclusion: With these findings of a congenital heart illness  Baby Avery was immediately referred to a pediatric cardiac surgeon. The operation's timing will be crucial due to Avery’s young age  but postponing it can lead to more serious complications like cyanosis and """"Tet spells"""". Upon a successful operation  Baby Avery's prognosis is good. His case demonstrates the importance of careful physical examination  knowledge of family history  and recognizing early symptoms of congenital heart disease among primary healthcare providers.  Recommendations: Medical Management including maintaining hydration  proper nutrition  and prophylaxis against endocarditis until surgery. A proper timeline for the surgical correction will be identified by the pediatric cardiac surgeon based on the baby's overall health. Genetic counseling is suggested for the parents due to the familial nature of the defect."
13,9,22,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial22,Patient Information:   The patient is a six-month-old Caucasian female named Anna Smith. She was born on July 25th last year and lives with her parents in NY  USA.  Presenting Issue:   Anna was brought to the clinic by her parents due to her failure to gain weight  excessive sweating  and fast breathing even with minimal activity like feeding.  Medical and Family History:  Anna is the only child born to non-consanguineous parents. Her mother  aged 32  had a routine antenatal period with no history of smoking  alcohol  or drug use. The mother's medical history is pertinent for hypothyroidism  well controlled with medication. Her father  aged 34  is healthy with no known medical issues. Anna's family history is unremarkable  with no previous instances of congenital abnormalities or sudden cardiac deaths in the family.  Clinical Examination:   Upon physical examination  Anna was noted to have mild cyanosis  especially on her lips and fingers. There were no clear signs of dysmorphism or syndromic features. Heart auscultation revealed a loud  harsh  pansystolic murmur at the left sternal border  indicating a possible left-to-right shunt. This was corroborated by echocardiography which revealed a moderate-sized ventricular septal defect (VSD). Other organ systems appeared normal.  Investigations:  Laboratory investigations were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram revealed right axis deviation and left ventricular hypertrophy. Chest radiography indicates increased pulmonary blood flow. Genetic testing for congenital heart defects was negative  suggesting the defect is likely non-syndromic.  Diagnosis:   After synthesizing the information from Anna’s symptoms  physical examination  and investigations  a diagnosis of isolated moderate Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) was made  which is a common type of Congenital Heart Disease.  Management and Follow-up:  The pediatric cardiologist suggested conservative medical management initially  as some VSDs can close spontaneously. Anna will receive medications to mitigate the symptoms of heart failure  like excessive sweating and breathlessness. Her parents were counseled on the symptoms of worsening cardiac failure and when to seek immediate medical help. She will need to have routine follow-up appointments to monitor her condition. If the defect does not close spontaneously or if her symptoms worsen  surgery may be considered.   Outcome:  With the proper follow-up and management strategy  Anna's prognosis is generally favorable. Though she might need to have surgery  advancements in pediatric cardiac surgery have made this a relatively safe procedure with good long-term outcomes. 
13,9,23,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial23,Patient Profile:  Name: Jane Doe Age: 2 years old Gender: Female Race: Caucasian Residence: Los Angeles  California  Presenting Problem:  Jane presented to the pediatrician with symptoms of recurrent respiratory infections  poor feeding  low weight gain  and excessive fatigue  particularly after feeding. Her family has also noticed that she sweats more than normal  particularly during feedings  and appears to sometimes have rapid or difficult breathing. Given these symptoms  she was referred for a cardiology consultation.  Past Medical History:  Jane was born at term via an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Her developmental milestones were reported normal for the first year. However  her parents noted that she has not been gaining weight appropriately over the past six months. She has been having frequent visits to the pediatrician due to recurrent respiratory infections. No prior surgical history is reported. Her immunizations are up to date.  Family History:  Jane's family history is significant for cardiovascular conditions. Her maternal grandfather had a heart attack at age 55 and her mother  aged 30  has been diagnosed with hypertension. No known congenital heart diseases or genetic conditions were reported in the family.  Examination and Investigations:  On examination  Jane has a heart murmur  cyanosis of lips  and her pulse was weaker than normal. An echocardiogram was conducted which showed structural abnormalities indicating a congenital heart defect. She also had a chest X-ray showing a boot-shaped heart  indicative of Tetralogy of Fallot. Further tests  including ECG and cardiac MRI  confirmed this diagnosis.   Brief Discussion:  Jane has been diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a common type of congenital heart disease  characterized by four anatomical abnormalities of the heart. It explains her recurrent respiratory infections  failure to thrive  cyanosis  and fatigue. Given the severity of her symptoms and to prevent further complications  the cardiologist recommended surgical correction – complete intracardiac repair.  Treatment Plan:  The treatment plan involves a complete intracardiac repair which is typically carried out between three to six months of age. However  given Jane's current clinical symptoms and delayed weight gain  the benefits of performing surgery now outweighs the risks. The surgery aims to improve her quality of life significantly. The prognosis following surgical repair of Tetralogy of Fallot is generally very good  and most children can expect to lead a normal life with routine cardiology follow-ups.  In conclusion  this case highlights the importance of early recognition of symptoms connoting congenital heart defects  prompt referral for thorough examination  and appropriate management to offer these children a chance to lead a normal  healthy life.

He comes from a middle-income family background  is unmarried  and lives with his parents. He was referred by his primary care physician due to symptoms of progressive breathlessness and fatigue  especially during physical exertion in the past six months.  Past Medical History:  Jamie was diagnosed with congenital heart disease (Tetralogy of Fallot) at birth but he had undergone corrective surgery at the age of 10 which improved his condition significantly. His medical history is also significant for recurrent chest infections during his early teens. Apart from this  he does not have any history of diabetes  hypertension  or any other major illnesses.  Family History:  His father suffered from hypertension and his mother is a type 2 diabetic. Also  his older brother has a history of rheumatic heart disease. However  there is no family history of congenital heart disease.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  the patient is found to be cyanosed  with clubbing of fingers. On auscultation  a loud systolic murmur is heard best at the left sternal border. His blood pressure is normal whereas his pulse rate is slightly elevated. His chest x-ray shows an upturned apex of the heart and an echocardiogram confirms the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot.  Diagnosis: Given the above findings  Mr. Jamie L. seems to be experiencing complications related to his congenital heart disease - the Tetralogy of Fallot that despite surgical intervention during his childhood  is impacting his quality of life.  Plan: An evaluation by a cardiologist is recommended for a follow-up on his congenital heart disease. Based on this specialist's recommendation  further diagnostics  possible cardiac catheterization  or repeat surgical intervention may be considered to relieve his symptoms. During this period  lifestyle modifications  antibiotics prophylaxis for subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE)  emphasis on flu and pneumococcal vaccines and symptomatic treatment for his breathlessness  including beta-blockers  is recommended. The patient is also advised to seek genetic counseling  prior to starting a family due to the inherited nature of some forms of congenital heart disease.
13,9,25,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial25,Patient Case Presentation  Demographics: The patient is a 2-year-old male  hailing from a small village in rural Kansas. He is of Caucasian descent. His parents are both middle-aged with no significant medical history.  Chief Complaint: The patient was brought in by the parents reporting rapid breathing and signs of fatigue during feeding. They also mentioned occasional cyanosis during crying.  Past Medical History: The patient was born at 39 weeks gestation following a cesarean section due to the mother’s preeclampsia. His birth weight was 3.4 kg  and there were no complications during delivery. Apgar scores were 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Neonatal screening tests came back normal  and the baby was exclusively breastfed.  Family History: There’s no known history of congenital heart disease or other genetic disorders from both the maternal and paternal sides of the family. The mother's pregnancy was uneventful.  Physical Exam: On initial examination  the child's weight and height were found to be below the 5th percentile  indicating growth failure. Heart examination revealed a pansystolic murmur at the left sternal border with bounding pulses.   Investigations: A chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings. Echocardiogram revealed a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)  overriding aorta  right ventricular hypertrophy  and pulmonary stenosis  confirming the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart disease. Laboratory tests including complete blood count  prothrombin  and partial thromboplastin time were within normal limits. The results of the genetic screening are pending.  Treatment: Presently  the patient is under medication to control symptoms. His oxygen saturation level is regularly monitored. The patient is also scheduled for a full surgical repair of his heart defects in the upcoming weeks.  Prognosis: With timely intervention and good postoperative care  the prognosis for this child can be substantially improved. It is essential to engage a multidisciplinary team approach involving cardiologists  cardiothoracic surgeons  and critical care specialists.   Social and Economic circumstances: The financial burden on the family is significant given that all the medical services are out-of-pocket expenses.

This case highlights the importance of early recognition of congenital heart diseases  despite no family history  to ensure optimal growth and development of affected children.
13,9,26,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial26,Patient Profile: Mr. John Doe is a 16-year-old Caucasian male  originally from the Midwest. He comes from a middle-class socioeconomic background. John attends high school in his locality and lives with two parents; a computer programmer father and a nurse practitioner mother. He also has a younger sister aged 12.  Medical History: John's past medical history has been unremarkable up until now  with no major illnesses or injuries. He has not had any prior surgeries  and his immunizations are up to date. He has no history of allergies or chronic diseases such as diabetes  asthma  or seizures. John confessed that he occasionally consumes alcohol in social settings  but denies any illicit drug use or cigarette smoking. His diet is moderately healthy  but he reports occasional fast food intake.  Presenting Symptoms: Mr. Doe presented complaining of persistent and increasing fatigue  especially during physical activities at school  fainting spells  and occasional chest pain for the past three months. His teachers reported a drop in his academic performance recently  attributing it to his frequent absence from school due to these health issues.  Diagnostic Results: Physical examination showed cyanosis of the lips  clubbing of the fingers and a heart murmur. Further investigation with an echocardiogram confirmed a diagnosis of congenital heart disease - more specifically  Tetralogy of Fallot. This condition is characterized by a combination of four heart defects that affect the structure of the heart and cause oxygen-poor blood to flow out of the heart.  Family History: John’s parents are both healthy and do not have a history of heart disease or chronic illness. However  his maternal aunt had a child with a congenic heart condition as well but the exact type is unknown. This raises the possibility of a genetic predisposition in the family.  Management and Prognosis: John has been referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further management. The course of treatment typically consists of surgical intervention to correct the defects  typically done in infancy or early childhood but sometimes delayed if the child is not symptomatic.  Further lifestyle modifications  regular follow ups with cardiologists and a proper diet will be advised to help manage his condition after surgery. Vitals and cardiac health will need to be regularly monitored to avoid any complications in the future.  This case presentation illustrates the importance of considering congenital heart disease in adolescents presenting with symptoms such as persistent fatigue  fainting spells  and chest pain  even if no significant past medical history is disclosed. Early detection and intervention for such cases are crucial in managing the disease and providing a better quality of life for patients.
13,9,27,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial27,Patient Profile: Ms. Jessica Mitchell is a 10-month-old female infant of Caucasian descent. She is the only child of her parents  both in their late 30s  residing in Primrose Park  California. The patient was presented to the pediatric clinic by her mother on March 15  2023  complaining about the baby’s episodes of breathlessness and bluish skin color change which was mainly noticed after physical activities.  Medical History:  Jessica was born at full-term via caesarian-section due to complications of placenta abruption  and she weighed 6.2 pounds. Although she had a brief stay in the NICU after birth due to mild respiratory distress  she was discharged in stable condition. Titanium clipping was done for patent ductus arteriosus and she was regularly followed up. She up-to-date with her standard infant immunizations and regularly visits the clinic for health checks  which  until recently  have shown no abnormalities.  Presenting Complaints:  Her mother reports frequent bouts of breathlessness during and after meals  noticeable weight loss  and delayed growth compared to other infants of her age. Her skin shows occasional bluish discoloration  particularly with exertion. Her appetite has been good and fever  cough  or cold are absent.  Family History:  Her family history is significant; her father once disclosed being diagnosed with an atrial septal defect in childhood  which was surgically corrected. There is no history of genetic disorders  maternal drug use  prenatal illnesses  or other known risk factors for congenital heart diseases.  Examination & Investigation:  Physical examination of Jessica reveals a cyanotic baby  with underweight and short stature compared to her age. Cardiovascular examination shows a loud holosystolic murmur with thrill. An echo-cardiogram was performed revealing a large ventricular septal defect (VSD). ECG findings and chest x-ray were also consistent with increased load on the right side of the heart.  Categorical Diagnosis:  Based on her symptoms  investigations  and a significant family history  Jessica was diagnosed with cyanotic congenital heart disease with a large VSD as the likely contributor.  Management & Outlook:  Her parents were counseled on the need for urgent surgical correction. The case was then referred to a pediatric cardiology surgeon for further management  including pre-operative assessment and setting the date for surgery. Prognosis after surgery is fairly optimistic given the early detection and no other associated major comorbid conditions.  In conclusion  it's paramount to screen early for congenital heart diseases  specifically in cases with a positive family history  even in the absence of significant risk factors. This could potentially lead to early detection and treatment  thereby significantly improving the child's health outcome and quality of life.
13,9,28,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial28,Patient Information  Name: John Doe Gender: Male Age: 18 months Ethnicity: Caucasian   Presenting Issue   Infant John Doe presents with a significant decrease in energy over the past few weeks. He has been frequently irritable and has had below-average gains in weight compared to the pediatric standard. He also exhibits labored breathing  especially during feedings  and profuse sweating.  Past Medical History   John’s prenatal history was uneventful  with normal antenatal screenings. He was a term baby with a normal birth delivery. However  since birth  there have been concerns about his low-activity levels compared to peers and slower-than-usual weight gain. No issues have been reported concerning his auditory and visual health.  Family History   Both parents are healthy  but there is a family history of cardiac diseases from the father's side. The paternal grandfather had a pacemaker  and an uncle had an unspecified heart condition.   Physical Examination and Relevant Tests   Upon examination  John had clear lung sounds but presented with a strong murmur. Oxygen saturation was around 86%  and his respiration rate was elevated.   Following the discovery of the heart murmur  an Echocardiogram was ordered  which showed Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart disease characterized by four anatomical abnormalities of the heart. This condition is the cause of John’s cyanosis or bluish discoloration of the skin because it allows oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich blood to mix.  Diagnosis and Management   John has been diagnosed with congenital heart disease (specifically  Tetralogy of Fallot).   This condition will require robust management and potential cardiac surgery to improve John's quality of life and survival. Until then  precautionary measures for prevention of “Tet” spells (periods of deep blue skin  shortness of breath  and unconsciousness) need to be observed.   John's parents will be educated on managing and observing for symptoms of low-oxygen spells  like sudden onset of deep blue skin  shortness of breath  and potential fainting. They should adopt the knee-chest position during these spells and seek emergent medical help.  In conclusion  John's diagnosis of congenital heart disease calls for meticulous medical management  potential surgery  and special care to improve his prognosis.

13,9,30,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial30,Presentation:  Patient Information: The patient is a two-year-old Caucasian male born to non-consanguineous parents. He resides in a suburban area with his family  including a healthy four-year-old sister. The parents reported no known exposure to environmental toxins or smoking during pregnancy and no history of substance abuse. They have no family history of genetic disorders  heart conditions  or unexplained childhood deaths.   History of Present Illness: The patient has been transferred from his pediatrician to the hospital after exhibiting signs of consistent rapid breathing and recurrent respiratory infections. Complaints also include poor feeding and lesser weight gain  accompanied by symptoms of fatigue during physical activities.   Past Medical History: The patient was full-term with normal vaginal delivery. However  a heart murmur was noted soon after birth during a routine check-up. Subsequent echocardiogram performed at four weeks of age demonstrated a complex congenital heart defect.  Current Clinical Investigation:  The child presented cyanosis during physical effort  precipitating examination by a pediatric cardiologist. An echocardiogram revealed Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a condition that includes four congenital abnormalities: a ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an over-riding aorta. He is not currently on any medications.  Physical Examination: On physical examination  he weighed below the 5th percentile for his age  suggestive of failure to thrive. He displayed signs of cyanosis during crying. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur was heard in the left mid-sternal border  and hepatomegaly was palpable.  Diagnosis: The constellation of symptoms and clinical findings led to a diagnosis of congenital heart disease - Tetralogy of Fallot.  Management: Immediate treatment pureed with monitoring of nutritional status to improve general health and weight gain in preparation for surgical repair of the defects. The child is scheduled for corrective cardiac surgery involving closure of the ventricular septal defect and relief of the pulmonary stenosis.   Follow-up: Regular follow-up appointments after surgery will be crucial to monitor the child's growth  development  and the function of the repaired heart.  Discussion: The case underscores the significance of early recognition and surgical intervention of congenital heart disease to prevent long-term complications such as displacement of the heart due to the enlargement of the right atrium  heart failure  or potential risk of sudden cardiac death.
13,9,31,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial31,Patient Presentation  Introduction: We present the case of a 3-month-old Caucasian male infant diagnosed with congenic heart disease (CHD) in a rural community hospital in Nebraska. The infant's diagnosis has considerable implications for further specialized treatment  as our institution lacks the necessary resources to handle complex CHD conditions.  Patient Information: The patient was born at full term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. The family has no history of any genetic disorders. The child is breastfed  on a regular immunization schedule  and has experienced normal development milestones. The family's history  however  includes heart disease  with both paternal grandparents receiving treatment for coronary artery disease.   Presenting Concern: The child was brought to the emergency room due to increasing episodes of cyanosis  specifically while feeding. The parents also reported frequent fatigues  less activeness  and unexplained sweating since the last week.  Medical History: The prenatal period was reportedly uneventful  with regular scans including a 20-week anomaly scan were performed  which were normal. Yet since birth  the child has visited the pediatrician thrice due to the above-mentioned symptoms  which were all diagnosed as conditions related to common cold and flu.  Examination and Investigation: Physical examination revealed a heart murmur with a tachycardic heart rate  and oxygen saturation was slightly low. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed some abnormalities  and an echocardiogram was hence advised. Echocardiography revealed a Ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pointing towards a diagnosis of CHD.  Progress and Current Status: On confirmation of CHD  the baby was referred to a cardiologist for further management and intervention. The family is looking into options for pediatric cardiac surgery in facilities that specialize in congenital heart disease.   Plan: In future appointments  the child would be closely monitored for his growth  nutrition  and development alongside his cardiac status. There would be a multi-disciplinary team involved in the patient’s ongoing care  with guidance on feeding and development  ensuring vaccinations are up-to-date  offering support to the family  engaging them in consultations regarding further interventions.  Conclusion: This case of CHD underlines the importance of thorough clinical examination in infants who chronically present with non-specific symptoms. The family history of heart disease  in this case  could suggest a potential genetic influence on the occurrence of CHD. Furthermore  this case demonstrates the challenges in diagnosing and treating CHD in rural settings where access to specialized healthcare is limited.
13,9,32,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial32,Patient Profile and Introduction:  The patient is a 7-year-old African-American male named T.J. He was diagnosed with a congenital heart disease called Tetralogy of Fallot at birth.   Medical History:  T.J.'s prenatal scans and neonatal assessments indicated a significant health problem. He showed symptoms immediately after birth  including cyanosis and shortness of breath  which led to his diagnosis. T.J. underwent a surgical repair within the first year of life. He has had several follow-up examinations and diagnostic tests since then  including echocardiograms and MRI scans of the heart. The interventions have been mostly successful  but his condition requires ongoing monitoring.  T.J. has also been treated for repeated episodes of respiratory infections  likely due to his heart condition. Otherwise  his developmental milestones and growth rate have been typical for his age.  Demographics:   T.J. lives in an urban area of Detroit  Michigan  with his mother  father  and younger sister. His socioeconomic status is low-middle class. T.J. is in the 2nd grade at a local public elementary school where he receives additional support for his physical education due to his heart condition.  Family History:   Both of T.J.'s parents have no known history of congenital heart disease or other significant genetic issues. However  his mother experienced gestational diabetes during pregnancy  which  though it was well-controlled  could have contributed to complications. His mother did not use any substances with known teratogenic effects during pregnancy  such as alcohol  tobacco  or illegal drugs.  Case Presentation:   Recent follow-up echocardiography confirmed some level of residual pulmonary stenosis and right ventricular hypertrophy  which may need future medical or surgical interventions. Clinically  T.J. presents a slight exercise intolerance and occasionally gets fatigue faster than children his age.   Plan:  The plan includes conducting ongoing cardiology follow-ups every six months or sooner  depending on symptom presentation. Intermittent monitoring tests  such as electrocardiograms  holter monitoring  and exercise stress tests  will also be implemented to assess disease progression and the potential need for intervention. T.J.'s daily activity will continue to be limited  given his exercise intolerance.   Coordination with his school will also be required to ensure appropriate accommodations are made for him. T.J.'s parents have been educated on the importance of regular care and keeping his vaccinations up-to-date  especially the annual influenza vaccine  given his predisposition to respiratory infections. They have also been advised to ensure a healthy diet and moderate  safe exercise for T.J. to minimize any risk factors for heart disease.   This case has a significant emotional impact on the family. Therefore  referrals to psychological services for support and counseling have been provided. Ensuring optimal care for T.J. involves an integrated approach that monitors his medical situation while also targeting quality of life factors.

Mother is a high school teacher  and the father is an engineer by profession.   Chief complaints & Presenting Condition Sam was brought to the clinic by his parents due to complaints of fatigue  shortness of breath  and difficulty in participating in physical activities like his peers  accompanied by cyanosis and heart murmurs.  Past Medical/ Surgical History Sam's prenatal and postnatal periods were uneventful. He has had no significant illnesses or surgical interventions till date. Sam received all routine immunizations according to the recommended schedule. The mother reported gestational diabetes during her pregnancy with Sam.   Family History Family history reveals that his paternal grandmother had heart disease  specifically a bicuspid aortic valve. Sam's mother and elder sister have no known heart conditions.  Physical Examination  Upon examination  vital signs were within normal limits for his age. Sam appeared to be of average height and weight for his age. Cardiac examination revealed cyanosis of the lips and tongue  a single second heart sound (S2)  and heart murmurs.  Investigations Further investigations  Electrocardiography (ECG)  Chest X-ray and an echocardiogram were conducted  which demonstrated a congenital heart defect - Tetralogy of Fallot. The ECG showed right ventricular hypertrophy  and echocardiogram clearly demonstrated a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) and overriding aorta.    Management and Treatment  Sam was recommended for cardiology referral to assess his suitability for corrective surgery. Meanwhile  he was prescribed medications to control his symptoms - a diuretic (Furosemide) and a beta-blocker (Propranolol). He was also scheduled for regular follow-ups to monitor his condition.   His parents were provided with a list of symptoms that could indicate deterioration of his condition  such as increased cyanosis  poor or slowed growth  or frequent respiratory infections  at which point they should seek immediate medical attention.  Psychosocial Observations Sam's parents were cooperative  although understandably concerned and anxious about their child's health. Sam was shy but well-behaved and cooperative during the consultation. His elder sister displayed a protective attitude towards him  and the dynamics between the siblings and the parents were positive. The family was referred to a child psychologist to help them cope with the situation.   Conclusion The case highlights the importance of early detection of heart murmurs and cyanosis in children  as these can be indicative of congenital heart disease. With proper medical intervention and family support  Sam has a good prospect for a life of improved quality and longevity.
13,9,34,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial34,Patient Identification: B.S.  Age: Six weeks old Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Residence: Townsville  Queensland  Australia  at home with parents Insurance: Private Insurance  Presenting Symptoms: B.S. parents noticed episodes of rapid breathing  poor feeding  and cyanosis especially when B.S. is crying.   Past Medical History: B.S. was born at term with an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. He had normal newborn screening tests and was discharged home in good health. At six weeks  his parents noticed him having difficulty feeding and breathing  which triggered them to seek medical attention.  Family History: No known family history of congenital heart disease. Both parents are healthy.   Physical Examination: On examination  B.S. had an audible heart murmur and was cyanotic  with oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. His pulse rate was slightly higher than expected for his age (160 bpm).   Diagnostic Findings: Based on the clinical history and physical examination  a Pediatric Echocardiogram was ordered which revealed a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonic stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy and an overriding aorta  all characteristic features of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).   Treatment and Discussion: Congenital heart disease  such as Tetralogy of Fallot  requires immediate attention. B.S. was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. After careful discussion considering B.S.'s young age and clinical condition  he was started on Prostaglandin E1 to keep the ductus arteriosus patent while waiting for cardiac surgery. Nutrition and hydration were ensured via a feeding tube.  Future therapeutic strategy consists of surgical repair  typically performed between 3 and 6 months of age. The procedure will involve closing the VSD and removing the area of pulmonic stenosis to improve oxygenation.   Discussion: This case highlights the importance of early recognition of congenital heart disease in neonates and infants. The symptoms may be nonspecific  like in B.S.'s case where dyspnea and difficulty feeding were the primary symptoms recognized. Hence  an echocardiogram is an extremely useful test to diagnose CHDs.  Payment Source: The patient's healthcare costs are covered by private insurance. It is estimated that the cost of the diagnosis  hospital care  and surgical repair would range in the tens of thousands of dollars.   Follow-up:  Frequent follow-ups and careful monitoring will be necessary for B.S. His parents will be educated about B.S.'s condition  management  warning signs to look for  and steps to take in case of emergency in between scheduled hospital visits.

Presenting Problem: Jane was admitted to the pediatric unit due to increasing episodes of cyanosis  particularly during feeding; she becomes breathless and turns blue.  Past Medical History: Jane was born full-term via vaginal delivery  with no complications during pregnancy reported by the mother. No prior hospitalizations or illnesses since birth.  Family History: Both parents are healthy with no reported genetic diseases. The mother has two older children (ages 6 and 4) who are in good health. There's no history of heart diseases in the family.  Physical Examination: Jane's vitals show a heart rate of 155 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 60 breaths per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Cardiac examination reveals a harsh systolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border. There was no organomegaly felt on abdominal palpation.  Diagnostic Findings: An echocardiogram was obtained which showed a large ventricular septal defect  overriding aorta  right ventricular outflow tract obstruction  and right ventricular hypertrophy. These findings are consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart disease.  Plan: The patient has been started on Propranolol to control her heart rate and a diuretic to reduce fluid overload. We have referred Jane to pediatric cardiothoracic surgery for surgical repair. Genetic counseling was also recommended to the parents to discuss the risk of recurrence in future pregnancies and the possible need for early prenatal diagnosis.   The parents meanwhile have been educated on how to handle cyanotic spells  focusing on knee-chest positioning and calming the infant. In addition  we have provided them with information about the disease  its complications  and the need for lifelong follow-up with a cardiologist.

There is no family history of any congenital disorders or heart diseases on either side of the family.   Examination and Diagnosis: Upon examination  baby 'K' was found to be below the third percentile for weight for her age  but was within norm for length. Higher than normal heart rate and respiratory rate were noted. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur was detected on auscultation over the left lower sternal border  with no abnormal lung sounds. An echocardiogram revealed a large ventricular septal defect with evidence of left-to-right shunting  confirming a diagnosis of Congenital Heart Disease (Ventricular Septal Defect - VSD).   Treatment and Follow Up: Baby 'K' was referred to a pediatric cardiologist. Nutritional support was intensified to facilitate growth. The options of open-heart surgery to close the defect versus conservative management (watchful waiting) were discussed.   This case underlines the importance of measuring and tracking growth parameters meticulously in infants  as failure to thrive can be an important clue to diagnosing congenital heart diseases. It also highlights the crucial role of cardiac auscultation in routine physical checks  even in the absence of a familial predisposition.   [This is a general example and the doctors should use their judgment and actual patient data when discussing cases.]
13,9,37,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial37,Patient Profile:  Name: John Doe Gender: Male Age: 2 years old Race: Caucasian Residence: New Jersey  USA Parent's occupation: Father- IT professional  Mother- homemaker  Presenting Complaint: John Doe  a 2-year-old male infant  was brought in by his parents who have noticed that he becomes excessively cyanotic and breathless while feeding and has been failing to gain weight.  Past Medical History: John was born at full term via normal vaginal delivery after an uneventful pregnancy. His neonatal period was marked by frequent episodes of cyanosis  clubbing  and difficulty in breathing. His growth milestones were delayed and there were no hospitalizations following birth. No known allergies are reported.  Immunization is up-to-date as per age.  Social History: He stays with his parents and 5-year-old sister. There are no smokers or occupants with any chronic diseases in the household. The sister is healthy  with normal growth and development.  Family History: There is no known family history of congenital heart disease  cystic fibrosis or any other genetic disorders. Parents are non-consanguineous with no history of similar symptoms in close family members.  Physical Examination: John is alert with noticeable cyanosis and clubbing. He has a weight of 9.7 kg (<5th percentile for age) and height of 82 cm (<5th percentile for age). He is afebrile with a pulse of 120/min  blood pressure 90/60 mmHg  respiratory rate of 32/min  and oxygen saturation of 78% on room air.  Notable findings on cardiovascular examination included a loud systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border with radiation to the back.  Diagnosis & Plan: John Doe was referred to a pediatric cardiologist where a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot- a congenital heart disorder was confirmed via echocardiogram. The diagnosis correlated with the patient's signs of cyanotic moments  clubbing  and failure to thrive which are emblematic of this underlying congenital heart condition.  The plan is to proceed with corrective surgery to repair the defects in the heart. Long-term follow up will be required to monitor John's growth  development  and cardiac function. The parents are counseled about the procedure  and genetic counseling is advised to assess the risk in future pregnancies.      An appointment with a dietitian is also suggested to discuss dietary strategies that will support John's growth and feed management to limit the episodes of cyanosis post feeding. Regular follow-up appointments every three months to monitor his development are outlined in the plan.   This patient case provides an overview of the manifestation and gravity of congenic heart defect in infants and highlights the importance of early identification and treatment in such cases.
13,9,38,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial38,Patient Brief:  The patient  JM  is a male newborn  10-days old  racially identifying as Hispanic  who originally arrived at our medical office for his first pediatric checkup visit after discharge post-birth from another affiliated hospital. He was born at 39 weeks via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery with a birthweight of seven pounds and two ounces. No prenatal complications or intervention emerged during birth. He was discharged after 48 hours in the hospital with no antenatal or postnatal concerns.   However  during the routine post-discharge check-up  abnormal heart sounds (a loud murmur) were noted  leading to the decision to undertake further investigation.  Past Medical History: JM’s past medical history is essentially void since he has only made one presentation to a healthcare facility  that is during his birth. No illnesses or hospitalizations occurred during that time. He has not received any major surgical operations or medications thus far. Also  JM was up-to-date with all neonatal vaccinations respective of his age.  Family History: On the paternal side  JM's father  who is 25 years of age  has no known medical conditions. His mother  24 years of age  has Type 1 diabetes and raised cholesterol. JM is their first child. The mother had regular follow-ups during her gestational period and she managed her diabetes well. The family has no known history of congenital anomalies or early heart disease.  Examination: Upon examination  the baby had diaphoresis and fatigue during feeding. The cardiologist used an echocardiogram to determine the heart's structure  which uncovered a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart disease characterized by four defects: ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta.  Future interventions will include medications to manage symptoms  and cardiac surgery is scheduled to correct the defects. The patient will have regular checkups to monitor growth  development  and to ensure the heart is functioning properly. Recommendations on early genetic counseling have been provided to parents since one future aspect suggests there may be a genetic role with an increased risk for congenital heart disease.    Overall  this case reiterates the importance of systematic review and examination of the newborn baby before departure from a healthcare facility and during follow-ups. Even if no immediate concerns were discerned post-birth  detections of abnormality can emerge within the weeks to follow  emphasizing the critical importance of routine post-natal check-ups.
13,9,39,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial39,Patient Identifier: Mr. A   Demographic Information: Mr. A  a 6-year-old Caucasian male child from the urban region  was born full term via uneventful vaginal delivery.  Presenting Problem: The child was diagnosed with congenital heart disease (Tetralogy of Fallot) immediately after birth. The diagnosis was performed based on the presence of a heart murmur on chest auscultation followed by confirmatory echocardiography. The child presents the known symptoms of the disease including 'blue baby' spells  difficulty in breathing  failure to gain weight  and frequent tiredness.  Past Medical History: The patient had been receiving medical management in the form of medications (Propranolol) and was recommended for surgery 'complete repair' recommended between 3-5 years of age. However  due to frequent respiratory infections  the surgery had been delayed. The patient had no history of medications other than those for this condition.  Social History: Healthy mother with no significant past medical history and two older healthy siblings. No history of nicotine  alcohol  or drug use. The family is of average socioeconomic status and lives in a clean environment.  Family History: There is no known family history of congenital heart defects or any significant genetic disorders. His maternal uncle has type 2 diabetes  and the paternal grandmother had rheumatoid arthritis.  Current Clinical Status:  The patient is brought in now for fatigue  shortness of breath  and a new-onset 'blue spell'. Upon physical examination  the child was found to be cyanotic with clubbing seen in the fingertips. These findings  along with a classic 'boot-shaped heart' on chest radiograph  confirm the worsening of Tetralogy of Fallot.  Plan: Immediate arrangements are made for the patient to be stabilized. The healthcare team plans to improve the child's oxygen level  maintain hydration  and prepare him for the surgical repair as soon as possible. Genetic counseling might also be useful for the family to understand the risk of recurrence in future offspring.  Outcome: Anticipated outcome postoperatively is excellent  with the child expected to lead a normal life. The medical team will monitor wellness  growth  and development while watching out for complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure.  Overall  this case presentation implies that early detection and ongoing management of congenital heart disease can significantly improve the outcome and provide a normal life to the affected child. Notwithstanding  multi-disciplinary care involving cardiologists  surgeons  pediatricians  nurses  and genetic counselors is key to providing holistic care to these children.
13,9,40,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial40,Patient Profile: Our patient  Baby Sam  is a 5-month-old male  born on June 1  baby Sam is currently living in a small urban area in the United States with his parents. He is the first-born child of a 32-year-old father and a 29-year-old mother. Baby Sam has no siblings. The mother had a smooth full-term pregnancy with no reported complications. Baby Sam had a normal delivery with Apgar scores of 8 at 1 minute  and 9 at 5 minutes.   Medical History: Baby Sam was clinically asymptomatic until he completed three months. In the fourth month  his mother noticed that he was showing signs of breathlessness and lethargy. Upon examination  physical signs included a palpable thrill  a prominent precordium  a loud pulmonary component of second heart sound  and a systolic murmur. There was no cyanosis. His weight gain was below the expected due to the lack of appetite and increased metabolic demand. He had frequent chest colds and struggled with a persistent cough. Upon further examination  baby Sam was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect  Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD).  Family History: Both parents denied any history of congenital heart disease in their families  and they are both non-consanguineous. The absence of a family history of hereditary diseases was confirmed  including diabetes  hypertension  or hypercholesterolemia.   Diagnosis: Baby Sam was admitted to the pediatric unit for further examination and diagnostic work-up. An echocardiogram confirmed the presence of a mid-muscular VSD measuring around 4 mm. Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm. Chest X-rays revealed increased cardiothoracic ratio and lung congestion. These diagnostic findings supported the primary diagnosis of Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD).   Treatment & Management: Given the small size of the defect and his age  the pediatric cardiologist recommended initial conservative management. This involved high-caloric nutrition  diuretics to minimize congestive heart failure  and closely monitoring Baby Sam's growth and development. Surgery was discussed as a potential future intervention if the defect did not close spontaneously or crowded the patient's life quality.  This case highlights the importance of early detection through careful clinical assessment in order to improve the quality of care and provide a definitive management plan for children with congenital heart disease. Future appointments were planned to monitor Baby Sam's status closely. His parents were educated about his condition  its potential complications  and instructed on the importance of regular follow-ups to track his progress. They were reassured that with timely and appropriate management  the prognosis can be favorable.
13,9,41,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial41,Patient Presentation  The patient  Leo Ward  is an eight-week-old  male infant born in the maternity department of our hospital. He was born naturally at 37 weeks and weighed 3.5 kg at birth. The labor was uneventful  and there were no apparent birth complications. His APGAR scores were 8 at one minute after birth and 9 at five minutes after birth.  All prenatal ultrasounds came back normal  and his mother’s pregnancy was uncomplicated. The patient’s mother  a 34-year-old Caucasian woman  is a non-smoker  non-drinker  and took prenatal vitamins regularly during her pregnancy. She has no significant medical history and no previously reported congenital anomalies. The patient’s father  a 37-year-old Hispanic man  does not have any known health problems  and there is no family history of congenital heart disease or early unexpected deaths.  At the 8-week wellness visit  the patient's parents expressed concerns about Leo's feeding. He is slow  sweats excessively  and becomes short of breath during feedings. At the end of his feeding  he appears fatigued. In addition to this  the patient's mother reported that Leo has not been gaining weight as expected for his age.  Upon examination  the physician noticed that he was indeed below average weight for his age. Heart sounds were indicative of a heart murmur  and he had a slightly faster heart rate compared to normal standards. These physical findings  combined with the symptoms described by the parents  raised suspicion of a potential congenital heart problem.  Further investigations were immediately sent for  and results from an echocardiogram confirmed a diagnosis of congenital heart disease  specifically a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). A VSD is a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart. An additional chest X-ray showed an enlarged heart  a sign indicating that the patient’s heart is working harder to pump blood.  Currently  the patient is being referred to a pediatric cardiologist for convergent management and the potential need for surgical intervention.  The family is understandably upset and anxious regarding Leo's diagnosis. Therefore  a consultation has been arranged with a genetic counselor to discuss the likelihood of recurrence in future children. Chart notes also suggest consulting a dietitian to assist with patient's nutritional needs owing to his poor feeding methods and low weight gain. This multi-disciplinary team approach will ensure all of Leo's health needs are met and any concerns from family members are addressed in a timely manner.
13,9,42,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial42,Patient Case Presentation: Congenital Heart Disease  Patient Information: The patient is a male  aged six months. He is a fraternal twin and the second child of a Caucasian couple in their early thirties. He was born full-term via a planned C-section due to his twin's breech presentation. His birth weight was within the normal range. Both parents are nonsmokers and do not drink alcohol. The mother reports a consistent prenatal care and no complications during the pregnancy. He received standard childhood vaccinations and has no known drug allergies.  Presenting Problem: The patient was brought in due to symptoms of poor feeding  rapid breathing  chronic respiratory illnesses  and failure to thrive.  Past Medical History: During the neonatal period  the patient presented symptoms of cyanosis  though it was initially interpreted as an effect of birth trauma. There has been no hospitalization or severe illness other than recurrent respiratory infections.   Family History: Both parents and the older sibling report no history of heart diseases or other significant illnesses. They are in good health. The twin brother is healthy and thriving well. The family history did not indicate any known congenital malformations or genetic disorders.  Investigations and Diagnosis: A thorough physical examination and echocardiogram were performed based on the presenting symptoms and his neonatal cyanosis. The echo showed an abnormal hole and a connecting valve between the two major arteries that connect to his heart  indicating a diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)  a congenital heart disease. An arterial blood gas (ABG) test was also conducted  indicating the need for surgery due to his low oxygen levels.  Management Plan: Plan to correct the PDA using cardiac catheterization or through surgical procedure  after consultations with the pediatric cardiologist and a cardiac surgeon.  Discussion: PDA is common  particularly amongst premature babies. In this case  despite the full-term birth  the patient showed symptoms which are signs of this congenital heart condition. The postsurgical prognosis is good  and with proper care  most children lead healthy lives. However  lifetime follow-ups may be necessary to monitor the heart condition. Health education should also be provided to the parents regarding the disease  its management  and prognosis.  References: This representation would be based on relevant references such as pediatric cardiology textbooks  guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA)  and current literature on congenital heart diseases.
13,9,43,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial43,Patient Presentation:  Name: John Smith Age: 3 Sex: Male  Presenting Condition:  John Smith  a 3-year-old male  presents with cyanosis and failure to thrive. John is diagnosed with congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a condition involving four anatomical abnormalities of the heart.  Past Medical History:  In infancy  John was noted to have delayed milestones but then were attributed to prematurity as he was born at 30 weeks gestation. He's been hospitalized twice during the first year of life due to pneumonia. Postnatal echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of TOF.  Family Medical History: There is a significant familial history of cardiovascular disease. John's mother suffers from hypertension and his elder brother had a ventricular septal defect repaired surgically in early childhood.   Social History:  John lives with his parents and older brother in a non-smoking household. His developmental milestones are on target for his age  except in the category of physical growth. Despite regular food intake  John has been unable to gain weight appropriately.   Examination: John’s body mass index (BMI) is considerably below the fifth percentile for his age and sex  indicating undernutrition. On cardiac examination  he presents a grade 4/6 harsh pansystolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border. He also shows clubbing of the fingers and toes  indicating chronic hypoxia.   Management: The optimal treatment is surgical correction  which comprises closure of the ventricular septal defect and relief of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. However  due to John's poor nutritional status  it's crucial first to improve this. Therefore  high-caloric dietary supplementation strategies have been implemented with the help of a pediatric dietician.   In conclusion  John's case is complicated by his failure to thrive and the significant familial history of cardiac disease. Multidisciplinary management involving cardiology  dietetics  and social work services is essential to his care moving forward.
13,9,44,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial44,Case Presentation:  Patient Information:   The patient is MR  a six-month-old male  born to his 28-year-old mother and 32-year-old father. He weighs 7 kg and appears to be of average stature for his age. He is of Caucasian descent and resides in a middle-class  suburban neighborhood.  Chief Complaint:   MR's parents bring him in with concerns about his poor feeding  difficulty in gaining weight  rapid breathing  and persistent fatigue.   Past Medical History:   MR's past medical history is limited given his age  but he has had recurrent respiratory infections since birth. His mother had a full-term normal delivery without complications  with adequate prenatal care including normal scans and tests. MR was not diagnosed with any congenital malformations at birth  with exception of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)  which was considered a normal finding at that stage.   Family History:   The patient's family history is notable  with his maternal grandfather having lived with a congenital heart disease  precisely a ventricular septal defect (VSD). There is no history of any genetic or hereditary disease in the family. Both parents are in good health.  Clinical Findings:   Physical examination reveals a thin and poorly nourished infant with mild cyanosis. MR exhibits tachypnea and tachycardia. On auscultation of MR’s heart  a continuous  machine-like heart murmur is heard  suggesting a patent ductus arteriosus.   Diagnostic Findings:  An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed signs of right ventricular hypertrophy  typically associated with congenital heart diseases. An echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus  revealing that the ductus arteriosus  which usually closes shortly after birth  remained open  causing blood to flow from the aorta to the lungs in MR's case.  Treatment and Conclusion:  Given the severity and the impact of the symptoms on MR’s overall health  an intervention to close the PDA was discussed and consented by parents. The possibilities of transcatheter device closure or surgical ligation were considered. MR is now scheduled for a cardiac catheterization for further evaluation and possible intervention.  To conclude  MR’s case is unique due to the late presentation of PDA symptoms  detection  and need for intervention. His family history of VSD might have contributed to the congenital heart disease. This puts an emphasis on the importance of early recognition and prompt treatment of PDA.
13,9,45,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial45,Patient Information:  The patient is a 5-month-old Caucasian male named Jake who was brought to the hospital by his parents due to persistent cough  rapid breathing  and difficulty feeding. Mr. and Mrs. Taylor  Jake's parents  are both in their early 30s and have no significant medical history. He is their only child and there are no known family histories of congenital heart disease or any other hereditary diseases.   Presenting Illness:  Jake displayed symptoms such as shortness of breath  rapid heart rate  and difficulty feeding since birth. The parents initially thought it was a common infancy illness but upon continuous observation of the symptoms getting worse  they sought medical attention.   Medical History:  Jake's prenatal history was uneventful  with his mother carrying full-term and an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. He did not require any neo-natal intensive care and was discharged in good health. However  in his 1st month well-child visit  mild tachycardia was noted. At 2 months  he was diagnosed with bronchitis and was treated with appropriate antibiotics. His symptoms didn't seem to fully resolve even after medication. No surgeries  known allergies or chronic disease has been recorded until this point.  Physical Exam:  Upon physical examination  Jake appeared alert but underweight  with a weight and height below the 5th percentile for his age. Auscultation revealed an abnormal heart sound (a heart murmur). Other findings included bluish skin coloration  especially around the mouth and fingers (cyanosis)  and rapid breathing rate (tachypnea).  Diagnostic Tests:  A chest X-ray was done  which showed an enlarged heart  raising suspicion of a possible congenital heart disease. Further tests such as Electrocardiogram (ECG)  and echocardiography were ordered. The echocardiography revealed a large ventricular septal defect  confirming the diagnosis of congenital heart disease.  Treatment Plan:  After consultation with a pediatric cardiologist  an open heart surgery was planned for repairing the defect. The parents are informed about the procedure  its risks  and benefits. Preoperative optimization of the patient's respiratory condition was also done.  This case highlights the importance of considering congenital heart disease in pediatric patients presenting with suggestive symptoms such as poor weight gain  respiratory distress  and a heart murmur. It also emphasizes the vital role of early detection and treatment to prevent future complications.
13,9,46,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial46,Patient Background: The patient is William  a six-week-old baby boy of Hawaiian descent  born at a local hospital in Honolulu. He weighs 5.3 pounds and has shown inconsistent weight gain since his birth. He was born full term via a normal vaginal delivery. He has two older siblings (ages 4 and 6)  both of whom are healthy with no significant past medical history.   The baby's parents have reported him showing signs of poor feeding and excessive sleepiness. No known family history of heart disease or any significant chronic illnesses. There were no complications during the pregnancy or birth. The mother received prenatal care  and all prenatal screenings were within normal limits.   Clinical Observations: On examination  the baby was cyanotic with a noticeable blue tint in the skin  lips  and nail beds. Other noticeable signs were rapid breathing  poor weight gain  and he seemed less active and less alert than other infants his age. The pediatrician during a routine check-up detected a heart murmur.   Diagnostic Assessment: Baby William was referred to a pediatric cardiologist who confirmed a heart murmur via stethoscope examination. An echocardiogram was performed  which revealed a ventricular septal defect (VSD)  a hole in the wall that separates the heart's lower chambers (ventricles). This is a common type of congenital heart defect. A detailed cardiac MRI confirmed the diagnosis and ruled out other cardiovascular abnormalities.   Treatment: The baby's VSD is significant and will require surgery soon to prevent harm caused by large volumes of blood flowing to his lungs from the left ventricle. A discussion was held with the parents detailing the surgery's benefits and risks  and parental consent for surgery was obtained. The baby would be closely monitored until the surgery  with cardiac medication administered to limit the symptoms.   Follow-up: Post-surgery  baby William would require regular follow-ups to monitor his progress and potential complications from the operation. Any changes in his feeding patterns or growth would be addressed  and he will be monitored to ensure his weight and development are on track. His parents have been informed about potential minor hurdles he may face and reassured that most kids with repaired VSD lead a healthy  normal life.   Education: The parents have been educated about congenital heart disease  the symptoms to look out for  and the feeding requirements in the days leading up to the surgery. They have been reassured about the high success rate of the procedure and have been given contact numbers to get in touch with the pediatric cardiac team  should they have any questions or concerns.   Coordination of Care: A multidisciplinary pediatric cardiac team involving cardiologists  cardiac surgeons  and pediatricians has been put together for baby Williams's care. The team has coordinated with the hospital's social work department to ensure the family's insurance covers the cost of care.
13,9,47,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial47,Patient Information:  Patient X is a five-year-old male of Caucasian descent. He was born on October 12th in Atlanta  Georgia  to a non-consanguineous couple. His birth length and weight were in the normal percentile for his gestational age and no abnormalities were noticed initially. Currently  he is enrolled in preschool and lives with both his parents and an older sibling.  Medical History:  In the first twelve months  he experienced difficulty with feeding and slower growth. After presenting with signs of persistent respiratory infections  he was referred to a Pediatric Cardiologist by his Paediatrician at 18 months of age. Following diagnostic tests such as an EKG  echocardiogram and cardiac MRI  he was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a common form of congenital heart disease.  Family History:  Both of the child's parents have no history of congenital heart disease. However  his maternal grandfather underwent heart bypass surgery at the age of 62 and his paternal uncle was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy at 37.  Current Situation:  The patient has been under regular follow-ups every six months since his diagnosis. His recent visit revealed an O2 saturation value of 89%  indicating blood oxygen levels below the normal range. Tet Spelling and cyanotic episodes are also becoming more frequent. He is presently on medication prescribed by his cardiologist including Furosemide and Propranolol.   Management Plan:  The Cardiology team has recommended a comprehensive evaluation with discussion on future surgical intervention. For further management and evaluation  the patient has been referred to a Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgeon to review the case and discuss the possibility  risks and advantages of early surgical intervention.  Social Implications:  The patient is loved and cared for by both parents who are concerned about the implications of the diagnosis. They are anxious about the surgery but have agreed on the necessity of intervention. The patient's education has been sporadic due to hospital visits and health instability  but his parents are committed to providing home tuition as needed.  Patient Prognosis:   The prognosis for the patient depends greatly on the success of surgical intervention. Early diagnosis and intervention tend to have a better prognosis  but careful monitoring of cardiovascular health will be required throughout his lifetime. Proper medical care  periodic assessment  surgical repair  and prompt attention to emerging symptoms can optimize his quality of life and longevity.
13,9,48,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial48,Patient Identification Information:  * Full Name: John Doe  * Age: One year old * Sex: Male * Race: Caucasian * Ethnicity: Non-Hispanic * Location: Seattle  WA  History of Present Illness: John Doe  a one-year-old Caucasian male  presented with concerns raised by his mother regarding his feeding habits and frequent respiratory infections. She reported that he gets tired quickly while feeding and has bluish coloration around his mouth (cyanosis). He has persistent shortness of breath and recurrent bronchitis which raised a suspicious trend  especially considering his age.  Past Medical History: This is John's first significant health challenge since birth. He was a full-term baby with normal growth and development milestones and no previous hospital admissions.  Family History: His mother mentioned a family history of congenital heart diseases. His elder sister had a surgically repaired atrial septal defect at 2 years of age.   Clinical Examination & Diagnostic Tests: Physical examination showed visible symptoms of prolonged illness - low body weight  pale skin  and frequent bouts of coughing. He had a systolic heart murmur and cyanosis was observed in his lips and tongue. Chest X-ray and echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a kind of congenital heart disease.   Management: The management plan includes the prescription of medication to improve his heart function and alleviate symptoms. In view of his age and family history  surgical intervention in the form of complete intracardiac repair is being considered. A consultation with a pediatric cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon is planned  and genetic counseling for the parents is also recommended due to the presence of familial congenital heart disease.  Follow Up: Regular follow-up visits will be crucial for monitoring John's progress post-surgery and maintaining his health.  This case represents the importance of considering familial patterns and early signs in the diagnosis of congenital heart disease. It emphasizes the significance of multidisciplinary management  including surgery  drug therapy  and genetic counseling for familial congenital heart disease in improving patients' quality of life.
13,9,49,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial49,Patient Profile: The patient in question is a 3-month-old female infant named Emily bearing Hispanic ethnicity. She lives with her parents in Los Angeles  California. Emily was born via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at term  with no notable complications during birth. She has always been healthy  according to her parents  with no known allergies so far. Emily is the second child in the family; her older sibling (a healthy  6-year-old male) has no known congenital condition.   Past Medical History: Emily's pediatrician was first concerned about a possible heart issue during her one-month check-up. The doctor noticed a murmur and requested further tests  leading to her diagnosis of Congenital Heart Disease. Specifically  an echocardiogram revealed that Emily has Tetralogy of Fallot  a condition comprised of four congenital heart defects. This includes Ventricular Septal Defect  Pulmonary Stenosis  Right Ventricular Hypertrophy  and an Overriding Aorta.  Family History: Emily's parents are both in relatively good health  with no known cardiovascular diseases. Both parents are non-smokers and lead a healthy lifestyle. Emily's paternal grandfather died of old age  while the paternal grandmother is living with Type 2 Diabetes. Her maternal grandparents are both alive  with no significant illnesses. A point of concern  however  is that Emily's paternal uncle passed away at a young age due to an unknown heart condition  which may have been congenital.  Symptoms: Emily's parents noticed that she occasionally turns blue  particularly while feeding or crying  a condition known as cyanosis. Emily also seemed to have shortness of breath and was not gaining weight at the expected rate  leading the parents to believe something was off.  Treatment Plan: Emily’s pediatric cardiologist has recommended surgery  which tends to yield a good prognosis in similar cases. The plan is to schedule comprehensive corrective surgery around the age of six months. Until then  Emily’s condition is managed with specialist monitoring and medications.   Implications: The presence of Congenital Heart Disease in infants is a serious concern  but with comprehensive medical intervention and regular follow-ups  children can lead a normal and healthy life. Psycho-social support for Emily's family remains an essential part of managing the situation. It is ensured that the extended family understands the importance of observing any unusual symptoms  and staying committed to Emily's long-term follow-up care.
13,9,50,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial50,Patient Information:  The patient is a male infant named Elijah  born on January 10  2022. He is the first child of Mr. and Mrs. Smith from Omaha  Nebraska. The couple has no history of congenital anomalies or other genetic disorders in either of their families' medical histories.  Presenting Problem:  Elijah was brought to the clinic during his six-week check-up  where his pediatrician discovered a heart murmur. Upon further examination  the doctor noticed Elijah showing signs of tiring easily  excessive perspiration  and poor feeding. This caused him to suspect a potential heart issue; therefore  he referred the child to a pediatric cardiologist.  History of Present Illness:  Post-referral examination by the pediatric cardiologist revealed Elijah suffering from Cyanosis when crying or feeding. He also showed signs of rapid breathing and pulmonary congestion. Elijah's weight gain has been slower than expected for a child of his age  attributed to increased energy expenditure due to his heart defect.  Past Medical History:  Elijah was delivered full term via a normal vaginal delivery with no immediate neonatal complications. His prenatal history was unremarkable  with no known maternal substance use  infection  or high radiation exposure.  Family History:  Neither of Elijah's parents has a history of heart disease. Both are healthy  non-smokers  and lead an active lifestyle. Mrs. Smith took prenatal vitamins  including folic acid  throughout her pregnancy and had no complications during that time. There is no family history of congenital heart disease on either side of the family.  Diagnosis:  Given the above clinical features  Elijah was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  among the most common congenital heart diseases. This was confirmed through an echocardiogram  which showed a ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta - the four components of Tetralogy of Fallot.  Plan:  The pediatric cardiologist has recommended cardiac surgery  typically done within the first year of life  to correct the defects. After the procedure  Elijah will require close follow-up visits and possibly additional treatments. His parents have been educated about the potential complications  prognosis  and the need for ongoing medical care.  This case was a continuous reminder that early detection  even with regular newborn check-ups  is essential in diagnosing and managing congenital heart diseases. The long-term prognosis varies depending upon the specifics of each case  but with early intervention  children like Elijah have a great chance for a healthy  normal life.
13,9,51,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial51,"Patient Presentation:  Profile:  The patient is a six-month-old female infant  born full-term via vaginal delivery. The child is of Asian descent  and both parents are healthy with no known congenital disorders.  Demographics:  The patient hails from San Francisco  California. The family includes parents in their early 30s and an older sibling who is 3 years old. The parents are biology teachers at a local high school. They live in an apartment with no pets.  Medical History:  The baby had no prenatal complications and was born with an Apgar score of 9. However  after 48 hours  the child was noted to be persistently cyanotic  which led to pediatric assessment.  Congenital Heart Disease Diagnosis:  The cyanosis was associated with labored breathing and poor feeding habits  raising suspicion of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). A physical examination revealed a distinct heart murmur. The diagnosis of CHD was confirmed with a pediatric echocardiogram  demonstrating Tetralogy of Fallot - the most common cyanotic congenital heart condition.  Presenting Symptoms: In addition to cyanosis  other symptoms at diagnosis were slow growth (identified during preliminary pediatric check-ups)  rapid breathing even when at rest  and multiple episodes of deep cyanosis known as """"Tet spells"""".  Family History:  There is no known family history of heart disease  any other chronic non-communicable diseases  mental health disorders  or genetic conditions. Both parents are non-smokers  and there was no exposure to harmful toxins or substances during pregnancy.  Current Management:  The baby is currently on oxygen therapy and uses a saturation monitor at home. Continuous reassessment of her feeding habits  weight  and general well-being is carried out by a multidisciplinary team  including the parents. Initial interventional cardiac catheterization was performed to improve blood flow which temporarily eased the symptoms.  Follow-up and future plans:  Definitive surgical repair  typically done between 4-6 months of age  is being planned for the child to improve the quality of life and promote normal development. This will involve a complete repair to correct all four heart defects of Tetralogy of Fallot in one operation.  The parents are provided with anticipatory guidance and are taught what to do during """"Tet spells"""". They are also connected with a local support group for families with children with CHD. Besides  a genetic consultation has been offered to understand their risk of having another child with CHD."
13,9,52,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial52,Patient Presentation:  Full Name: John Doe Age: 12 Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Presenting Complaint: Shortness of breath during physical activities  Past Medical History:  John  a 12-year-old Caucasian male  was born with Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF)  a common type of congenital heart disease. His case was diagnosed prenatally during a routine ultrasound. Postnatally  at three months of age  he underwent total corrective surgery. His recovery was uneventful  and he has been on regular follow-ups since then. He has been mostly asymptomatic  but recently started complaining of shortness of breath during physical activities. He also mentioned episodes of dizziness  but no fainting episodes were reported.  Family History:  John is an only child with no significant family history of heart disease. Both his parents are healthy with no chronic illnesses reported.  Social History: He is currently a 7th-grade student  doing well academically. He attends a regular school and lives with both parents. No history of smoking  alcohol or recreational drug use.   Physical Examination: On inspection  John's color is normal. No cyanosis or pallor noted. His growth is within normal percentile for his age. His weight is 45 kg (within the 60th percentile) and he stands at 150 cm tall (within the 50th percentile). There are no visible pulsations noted in the chest wall. He has a pulse rate of 80 beats/min and blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg.  Investigation and Diagnosis  The cardiac auscultation revealed a normal rate and rhythm with no abnormal heart sounds present. His resting EKG was normal. A chest X-ray didn’t show any significant abnormalities. An echocardiogram revealed right ventricular hypertrophy suggestive of ongoing pressure overload.  Impression: The combination of his symptoms and investigations suggest an issue with his previous ToF repair - possible right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The differential diagnosis includes residual lesions after ToF repair and possibility of pulmonary regurgitation. John was referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further evaluation and management.   Prognosis: The prognosis of patients post Tetralogy of Fallot repair is generally good  but depends on the residual defects present and the severity of the right ventricle dysfunction.   The plan is to follow-up closely with the cardiologist  and John is advised to limit his strenuous physical activities until further assessment. If needed  another surgical intervention may be required. Emotional and psychological support for John and his family were also recommended  considering the potential impacts of living with chronic disease on his mental health. 
13,9,53,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial53,Patient Information: J.P is a 1-month old female of Asian descent. She was born full-term via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery.   Case Presentation:  J.P. was brought to our clinic by her mother who reported that her baby has been having difficulty feeding and often appears tired. Examination revealed a bluish color to her skin and lips  especially during feeding. On auscultation  a heart murmur was detected. Echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of a congenital heart disease specifically Tetralogy of Fallot  characterized by structural defects in the heart and vessels.  Past Medical History:  She had a 1-week NICU stay due to transient tachypnea of the newborn. Other than that  she had no known allergies and was up to date with her immunizations.  Family History:  Her mother  a 38-year-old G1P1  had a gestational diabetes that was managed appropriately during the pregnancy. Maternal aunt had rheumatic heart disease. Paternal grandfather had hypertension. There is no known family history of congenital heart defects.  Social History:  J.P. lives with both parents in a smoke-free environment. She has no siblings. They have healthcare insurance and live within 10 min of the nearest hospital.  Physical Examination:  J.P. weighed 3.2 kgs. Her height was 51 cm  both falling within the normal percentile for her age. She had mild cyanosis. Her other vitals are as follows: RR- 58/min; HR- 148/min; Temp- 98.6°F.  Investigations:  Complete blood count and electrolyte levels were normal  EKG showed right ventricular hypertrophy and decreased pulmonary arterial flow pattern. The chest X-ray indicated boot shaped heart. The diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot was made after echocardiography showed a large ventricular septal defect  right ventricular outflow tract obstruction  and overriding of aorta.  Management:  After the assessment and diagnosis  the patient was referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and treatment. She was stabilized using intravenous fluids  supplemental oxygen. After stabilization  she will be considered for a surgical intervention  such as complete intracardiac repair.  Conclusion:  Early recognition  stabilization  and a multi-disciplinary approach are important in the management of J.P.'s case. The parents are also counselled about the nature of the disease and importance of regular follow-ups. It is also essential to assure them that most children with Tetralogy of Fallot completely recover after surgery and lead normal lives with regular monitoring.
13,9,54,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial54,Patient Presentation  Introduction: Mr. Johnson is a 25-year-old male diagnosed with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) at birth. He belongs to the Afro-American race residing in Seattle  Washington.   Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of CHD  at birth  which was corrected through surgery. The patient had been stable and managed well with regular check-ups until recent months when he started experiencing fatigability and shortness of breath. There is no history of any other major illnesses or surgeries. He's allergic to Penicillin which causes him skin rashes.   Presenting Problem: Presenting with progressive worsening of shortness of breath over the past six months  now noted to occur at rest. He had a decreased exercise tolerance and has reported a fainting spell two weeks ago.  Family History: His mother died at the age of 42 with an unspecified heart disease. His paternal grandfather is living with Hypertension and Diabetes. He has one older brother who is healthy  and genetic testing was negative in the family for any inheritable heart conditions.  Social History: Mr. Johnson works as a software engineer and is a non-smoker  and consumes alcohol occasionally. He is unmarried and lives with his father and brother.  Examination Results: On examination  he appears to be cyanotic with clubbing of fingers. A New murmur was noted on the cardiovascular examination. BMI is on the higher side (28)  blood pressure is observed to be normal  Oxygen saturation is noted to be 88% at rest.  Tests Conducted: After the initial consultation  several tests were conducted including Blood tests (RBC count reveals Polycythemia) Chest X-ray  ECG  Echocardiography (reveals right ventricular enlargement and Pulmonary regurgitation)  and Cardiac MRI.   Thought Process: Given the patient's history of CHD and his presenting symptoms  the concern is for deterioration of his right ventricular function related to his tetralogy of Fallot repair and/or the development of arrhythmias.   Treatment Plan: Currently on Beta-Blockers and Diuretics to manage his symptoms. Maintaining SpO2 above 92% is crucial. A Pulmonary valve replacement surgery is being considered  they discuss with the Cardiac surgical team. The patient was counseled and advised to have regular follow-ups whilst maintaining a moderate exercise routine and low sodium diet.  Prognosis: With appropriate surgical intervention and management  his life quality can be improved. However  he will require frequent follow-up and lifelong management of CHD. Detailed genetic testing and counseling should be considered for future family planning.  This case prompts the need for a multidisciplinary follow-up and revisiting surgical repair decisions in congenital heart diseases from a long-term perspective.
13,9,55,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial55,"Case Presentation  Patient Identification: The patient is a 6-month-old Caucasian male named John  who presents with signs of extreme fatigue  failure to gain weight  excessive sweating  and rapid breathing.  Primary Complaint and History of Present Complaint: John's parents informed their pediatrician about noticing the baby's frequent episodes of rapid breathing and coldness  particularly in his hands and feet. There had also been a noticeable lack of weight gain despite regular feedings and proper nutrition. Further  they reported the baby had been excessively sweating  even in the absence of hot weather or physical exertion.  Demographic Information: John is the only child of a middle-income family residing in Seattle  Washington. Both parents are professionals  and the family has access to regular medical care.  Past Medical History: John was born full-term through a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery with no complications. Apgar scores were 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes  respectively. However  shortly after birth  an audible heart murmur was detected during a routine newborn examination. This prompted further diagnostic evaluation.  Family History: Both parents are in good health with no chronic or hereditary diseases reported. There is no family history of congenital heart disease or other genetic disorders. The patient has two siblings  both of whom are in good health.  Physical Examination: Physical examination revealed a well-nourished baby  but at the 10th percentile for both height and weight-for-age. Upon auscultation  a heart murmur was noted. Other systems were within normal ranges.  Tests and Investigations: John was referred to a pediatric cardiologist where a heart echo and ECG were performed. The tests confirmed a congenital heart defect diagnosis  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot.  Summary: John's condition  Tetralogy of Fallot  is a cyanotic heart defect comprising ventricular septal defect  right ventricular hypertrophy  pulmonary stenosis  and an overriding aorta. This combination of defect results in decreased volume of blood reaching the lungs for oxygenation and increased pressure on the right side of the heart.   Initial Plan of Management: John is being closely monitored by his pediatric cardiology team  with a planned surgical intervention as he grows and gains strength. Regular follow-ups  appropriate vaccinations  and prophylactic antibiotic to prevent endocarditis are being maintained. Parents were educated about the """"Tet spell"""" – the baby turning blue during crying or eating – and were instructed to bring the knees close to the chest to help increase blood flow to the lungs. Early intervention services for necessary nutritional planning to help promote weight gain were also advised."
13,9,56,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial56,Patient Presentation Patient's Name: John Doe Age: 2 years Gender: Male Race: African American Ethnicity: Non-Hispanic Location: Chicago  Illinois  USA  Medical History: John Doe was born prematurity at 34 weeks gestation due to spontaneous onset of labor. His birth weight was 2.2 kilograms. At the time of his birth  John was diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome and was consequently admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for required medical interventions  including intubation and mechanical ventilation. He was gradually weaned off the ventilator in the space of a few weeks.  Diagnosis: Post-delivery  echocardiography and further medical evaluations revealed a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  one of the most common types of congenital heart disease. The condition is characterized by four cardiac defects that affect normal blood flow through the heart: ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta. This has resulted in episodes of cyanosis  especially during exertion such as feeding or crying (often referred to as “Tet spells”).  Family History: The patient's mother is a 28-year-old woman with no documented congenital anomalies or heart conditions. The father is 30 years old  no known genetic abnormalities or chronic illnesses. Unfortunately  the detailed family history regarding heart conditions is unknown due to the father's side having limited contact. The patient has an older sibling  now 5 years old  with no known medical disorders. No other family history of congenital heart diseases reported.  Relevant Information: John's congenital heart condition has significantly influenced his growth and development. He's been noted to have 'Failure to Thrive' due to his condition preventing him from feeding sufficient amounts without experiencing fatigue or Tet spells. At his 2-year birthday  John's weight and height were noted to be below the 3rd percentile for his age. The family also reported that John is developmentally delayed and has not yet started to walk.  Treatment Plan: Management for John involves careful monitoring of his heart condition and overall wellness. He is currently on prophylactic antibiotics before dental or surgical procedures to diminish his risk of acquiring endocarditis. He has also been placed on a higher caloric diet to address his 'Failure to Thrive' status. It is expected that he might require surgery in the future to correct the anatomical aberrations attributed to his Tetralogy of Fallot condition.
13,9,57,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial57,Case Presentation  Patient Details: The patient under presentation is a 3-month-old male baby  of Hispanic origin  referred to as Jake for confidentiality reasons. Jake’s family hails from a middle-income neighborhood in San Antonio  Texas.   Medical History: Jake was diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CHD) during a routine neonatal postnatal check-up. No apparent symptoms had been visible until the diagnosis. His pediatrician observed signs of breathlessness  rapid breathing  as well as a mild cyanotic depiction around his nail beds and lips. Jake's growth progress was also significantly lower than what is typically expected for a child his age  which was an initial indicator of an existing condition. Diagnostic tests  including echocardiography and chest x-ray  were performed  confirming the congenital heart condition.  Family History: The family history is significant because both Jake's elder sister and mother have a history of cardiovascular diseases. His elder sister  currently aged six  was also diagnosed with CHD two years after birth. His mother was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease during her late teenage years but managed with medication and lifestyle adjustments. Other family members do not reveal any patterns manifesting inherited heart disorders.   Living Condition: Jake lives with both parents  his elder sister  and a domestic house pet (dog). His living condition seems satisfactory concerning basic sanitation and home safety.   Disease Overview:  Jake is diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a common type of CHD. This condition combines four heart defects: ventricular septal defect (hole between the two lower heart chambers)  pulmonary stenosis (narrowed heart valve)  right ventricular hypertrophy (thickened heart muscle)  and overriding aorta (misplacement of the major blood vessel).  Plan: The pediatric cardiologist has been monitoring Jake's condition since the diagnosis. Medications have been prescribed to reduce the symptoms of the disease. Jake is expected to undergo a complete intracardiac repair when he is around 6 months and gains sufficient weight. A follow-up management plan will be focused on regular monitoring of Jake's growth  his cardiac functions  and overall physical activity. Dietary adjustments and physical activities suitable for his age and condition have been recommended. Genetic counseling is also suggested given the family history of heart diseases.  Conclusion: Jake's early diagnosis of congenic heart disease underscores the importance of routine neonatal check-ups in primary health care settings. His medical management plan relies heavily on the collaborative approach among the parents  cardiologists  pediatrician  and a cardiac surgeon  aiming to provide the optimal outcome for Jake's growth and development.

13,9,59,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial59,Patient Profile:  Name: Baby John Doe Age: Two months old Race: Caucasian Sex: Male Home Address: Los Angeles  California Status: Single  Chief complaint: Baby Doe's parents reported that he appears to show signs of fatigue  breathlessness and poor feeding.  Past Medical History: The baby was born at full term without any complications. His neonatal period was uneventful and he gained weight appropriately for the first few weeks. However  at around a month of age  his feedings started to become more difficult and he began showing signs of fatigue.  Present Illness: Upon physical examination  Baby Doe appears lethargic and has cyanotic lips. There's a visible pulse in the neck and a palpable thrill in the chest. Cardiac auscultation reveals a harsh holosystolic murmur.   Family History: The parents denied any family history of congenital heart diseases or other genetic disorders. Both are healthy and have no noted chronic illnesses. Baby Doe is the couple's first child. They also do not have any history of substance use that might have contributed to the condition.  Investigations: A chest X-ray was performed which revealed cardiomegaly. Additionally  echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of congenital heart disease  specifically ventricular septal defect (VSD).  Management: In collaboration with a pediatric cardiologist  the baby was started on a medication regimen of digoxin and diuretics to manage the symptoms of congestive heart failure. Parents also received counseling on feeding techniques tailored to babies with heart conditions.   Follow-up: The baby remains in stable condition under current management and is scheduled for reassessment at three months to monitor progress. If the VSD does not show signs of spontaneous closure and the symptoms persist or worsen  surgical intervention may be considered.  Educational counseling: The parents were provided with counseling about the disease  its implications  management  and prognosis. They were also informed about recognizing signs of deterioration and what to do in such cases.
13,9,60,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial60,Patient: John Doe Age: 17 Sex: Male Ethnicity: African American  Presenting Complaint: John came into the clinic with recurring fatigue  short breath after mild physical exercises and palpitations.  Past Medical History: John was diagnosed with Congenital Heart Disease at birth. He underwent surgery at the age of 7 months  called the Arterial Switch Operation for Transposition of Great Vessels  a type of congenital heart disorder. His post-operative period was uneventful  and he has had regular follow-up appointments with his pediatric cardiologist since then.  Family History: John's father passed away from heart disease at the age of 45. His paternal grandfather also suffered from heart problems. On his mother's side  there is a history of high blood pressure and stroke. His younger sister  6  is in good health.  Social History: John is in grade 11.

Current Medications & Therapies: John is currently on Furosemide and Spironolactone  which his cardiologist adjusted during his last routine visit three months ago. These medication adjustments help manage his symptoms and prevent future complications.  Immunization: John is up-to-date with immunizations  including the annual influenza vaccine.  Recent Laboratory Results: Echocardiogram showed moderate to severe biventricular systolic dysfunction with an Ejection Fraction of 35%. A recent chest X-ray demonstrated an enlarged cardiac silhouette.   Plan: Given John's family history  genetic counseling is recommended. Furthermore  considering his current status  a reassessment of his medical management is also recommended. The possibility of a heart transplantation should be discussed with the patient and family  considering his deteriorating cardiac function. Physical restriction should be maintained.  This case presentation discusses the challenges that a young patient with a congenital heart disease and family history of heart disease might face. It underscores the importance of regular monitoring and the potential need for further medical or surgical intervention given the socially limiting symptoms and deteriorating cardiac function.
13,9,61,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial61,Patient Presentation  Patient Information: The patient is a six-year-old girl. She is of Asian ethnicity and resides in San Francisco  California  in a middle-class neighborhood with her parents and 6-month-old baby brother.  Medical History: She was born at full term with no delivery complications. She consistently met all her development milestones. However  she presented symptoms of fatigue  shortness of breath  and slow weight gain from age 3. These symptoms overlapped with those of routine childhood illnesses and were overlooked initially. At age 5  she experienced recurrent respiratory tract infections requiring hospital admissions  leading to concern and a full diagnostic workup.  Family History: There is no known family history of heart disease. Her parents are non-smokers and in good health. Her younger sibling is currently in good health with no signs of disease. No relevant genetic disorders or significant diseases have been diagnosed in the extended family.  Observations and Examination: The child is observed to be smaller than typical for her age. Peripheral cyanosis is noted. Cardiovascular examination reveals a grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border.  Investigations and Findings: An echocardiography reveals a Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart disease that includes four defects: ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta. Further coronary angiography confirms the diagnosis. Pulmonary function tests reveal a moderate restriction with severe reduction in diffusion capacity.  Diagnosis and Treatment: The child is diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot. Immediate management involves maintaining her hydration and avoiding factors that could increase right to left shunting. A complete repair was planned. This involves closure of the ventricular septal defect and relief of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.  Prognosis: With correct surgical intervention  the prognosis is generally good. However  the patient would need lifelong monitoring to detect and manage late complications like arrhythmia and reoperation for pulmonary regurgitation.  Counseling and Follow-up: Parents are counseled about the nature of the disease  the need for surgery  and the probable outcomes. They are assured that with modern surgical techniques  her life expectancy and quality of life should approach normal. Regular monthly outpatient visits and postoperative echocardiograms are scheduled. 
13,9,62,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial62,Patient Overview: Patient X is a 6-month-old Caucasian male infant hailing from Cleveland  Ohio. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with a congenital heart defect  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot. This defect is characterized by four heart abnormalities  including a ventricular septal defect  right ventricular hypertrophy  an overriding aorta  and pulmonary stenosis – conditions that lead to oxygen-poor blood flowing out of the heart and to the rest of the body.  Present Medical History: Patient X's condition was detected through a newborn screening program using pulse oximetry. After birth  he experienced cyanosis and was unable to maintain oxygen saturation levels during feeding. Upon auscultation  a murmur was noted  further solidifying the need for echocardiographic screening.  Past Medical History: Being in infancy  patient X does not possess a long or complex medical history. However  he did exhibit low birth weight (weighing in at 5.5 pounds or around 2.5 kilograms)  which led to a brief stay in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).  Family Medical History: Patient X's parents are both in good health. His mother  age 32  experienced a normal pregnancy despite it being categorized as geriatric. There is no reported parental exposure to contributory teratogens or health-harming behaviors such as smoking or alcohol intake during gestation.  His father  age 33  does not have any known heart conditions. However  the family has a history of heart diseases  particularly on the paternal side  where both the grandfather and two out of three uncles had heart surgeries at a young age. No genetic testing has been done on the family to check for hereditary heart conditions.  Clinical Course and Treatment Plan: Patient X successfully underwent a complete repair of Tetralogy of Fallot at the age of 3 months. The procedure included closure of the ventricular septal defect and removal of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.  Currently  Patient X is recovering well but is being closely monitored for signs of post-operative complications or the need for future interventions. Regular follow-ups with a pediatric cardiologist are part of his ongoing care. The parents are educated about the signs of heart failure  and the importance of nutrition for growth and development. Physical activity has been encouraged and limited only if symptoms appear.  Psychosocial Considerations: Due to the continued impact of congenital heart disease throughout the life span  the parents of Patient X have been instructed about the importance of ongoing medical check-ups and psychosocial support. They were also provided resources to connect with other families who have similar experiences to aid in emotional support and understanding.   Although in his infancy  as Patient X grows  efforts will be made to provide him with age-appropriate education about his condition to normalize his experiences and better integrate into daily activities and routines.   Learning Points: This case highlights the importance of early detection and intervention in congenital heart diseases for improving the life expectancy and quality of life of the patients. It also emphasizes the necessity for familial involvement  support  and education to ensure comprehensive care.
13,9,63,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial63,Patient Information: Jane Doe  a 6-month-old female infant  Caucasian.  Reason for Visitation: Routine check-up and consultation for confirmed congenital heart disease diagnosis.  Demographics: Jane is an only child living with her biological parents in suburban Springfield. She was full-term at birth with a birth weight of 3.8 kilos. There's no history of alcoholism  smoking  substance abuse or domestic abuse in the family. The household environment is safe  clean  and the basic needs are adequately met.  Past Medical History: Jane had been diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a form of congenital heart disease  during prenatal screening at the 20-week gestational ultrasound examination. At 2 months of age  she underwent palliative shunt placement  and she has been closely monitored for signs of increased cyanosis and heart failure.  Presenting Symptoms: During the check-up  her parents noted progressive cyanosis  intermittent episodes of agitation and difficulty feeding  suggestive of increased right to left shunting and possible progression towards more severe cyanotic spells.   Family History: There is no past history of congenital heart disease in the family. Jane's parents and grandparents are all currently in good health  and there's no known family history of cardiac or genetic disorders.   Physical Examination: On inspection  Jane's general condition was stable but she appeared slightly cyanotic  particularly on her lips. Her heart rate was 130 beats/min. On auscultation  a loud systolic ejection murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border.   Investigation Findings: Her oxygen saturation remained stable at 82-85%. An ECG showed right ventricular hypertrophy and a chest X-ray suggested boot-shaped heart representing right ventricular enlargement. An echocardiogram confirmed the presence of the four defects characteristic of Tetralogy of Fallot.   Management Plan: Given her symptoms and age  a complete repair surgery was done to fix all four heart defects in a single operation  used to widen the path to her lungs and patch the ventricular septal defect.  Postoperative Follow-up: After the surgery  Jane remained in the pediatric ICU for observation and care. The cardiologist prescribed necessary medications and scheduled regular follow-up visits for Jane to monitor her growth  development  and to ensure the corrections are working adequately.  Summary: Jane's congenital heart disease has been managed proactively with necessary interventions  and her postoperative recovery is on track. Her case emphasizes the importance of prenatal screening  early diagnosis  and prompt treatment in managing complex congenital heart diseases like Tetralogy of Fallot. It also reinforces the need for comprehensive multidisciplinary care and follow-up.
13,9,64,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial64,Patient Information: The patient is a 12-year-old Caucasian male  residing in Buffalo  New York. He has a weight of 45 kgs and is 150 cm tall. The patient lives with his parents and one 8-year-old sister.  Presenting Complaint:  The presenting complaint is shortness of breath and difficulty maintaining physical activities  a symptom that was first noticed two years ago and has progressively worsened.  Medical History:  Except for the occasional common cold or flu  the patient’s past medical history is largely unremarkable with no severe illnesses or hospitalizations. According to the mother  the patient's prenatal and developmental history were normal.  Family History:  There is no known family history of congenital heart disease. However  the patient's paternal grandfather died of myocardial infarction at 63 years of age. The parents and sister are currently free from any cardiovascular diseases.  Clinical Findings:  Physical examination noted cyanosis  noticeably in the lips and fingertips  as well as clubbing. The patient had an O2 saturation level of 85%  and a percutaneous oxygen saturation level of around 88%. Cardiac auscultation revealed a loud systolic murmur.  Lab & Diagnostic Results:  The electrocardiogram showed right ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography showed a large ventricular septal defect along with pulmonary atresia. These findings  along with the patient's clinical presentation  lead to the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart defect.  Current Management:  Following the diagnosis  the patient was prescribed diuretics to prevent fluid buildup and reduce the workload of the heart. After discussing surgical  interventional  and medical management options  it was decided to proceed with cardiac catheterization to map out the heart and vascular anatomy before eventual surgical correction. The patient's family was counseled regarding the diagnosis  the anticipated plan  and likely long term prognosis.  Professional interpretation & Plan:  This is a case of Tetralogy of Fallot  which has shown to have increased morbidity and mortality if left untreated. The plan is to stabilize the patient and choose the best therapeutic approach. This will likely involve a staged surgical intervention given his age and health status. The potential need for lifelong treatment  monitoring  and follow-up is explained to the family  who are grateful for the clear and comprehensive plan. The family is encouraged to seek out support groups and counselling to help them manage the long-term care and emotional impact of childhood heart disease.
13,9,65,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial65,Patient Information: The patient is a 2-week-old female named Maya who was brought to the clinic by her parents for a follow-up after her birth. Maya was born at full term  via normal delivery  with a birth weight of 3.2 kilogram  which places her in the 25th percentile for weight. She was detected to have heart murmurs during her newborn screening  prompting further evaluation. Maya is the firstborn child in the family.   Medical History: Maya's pregnancy was uncomplicated and routine prenatal screenings and ultrasounds did not indicate the presence of congenital anomalies. However  immediately after birth  the newborn displayed symptoms such as rapid breathing  difficulty feeding  and a bluish skin color. After a physical examination  a heart murmur was detected. This sign  along with the clinical manifestations  raised suspicion for congenital heart disease.  Family History: After a thorough exploration of the family history  Maya's mother remembered that her brother (Maya's maternal uncle) was diagnosed with a hole in the heart. No other family members appear to have heart disease. However  having a close family member with congenital heart disease raises the risk for the condition in Maya.  Diagnosis: Due to the clinical symptoms and family history  an echocardiogram was conducted  which confirmed the diagnosis of Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). Ventricular Septal Defect is a congenital heart malformation characterized by a hole in the septum separating the two ventricles of the heart  causing mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.  Treatment and Prognosis: The neonatologist explained to Maya's parents about the condition and reassured them that some small defects might close on their own during the first year of life. As she is not in heart failure  the current management plan is to have conservative management with close surveillance of growth and development  monitoring of any possible onset of heart failure  and serial cardiac evaluations. In the case of her symptoms worsening or if she fails to thrive  surgical intervention may be needed.  Discussion: It is important to educate the parents about maintaining a heart-healthy lifestyle as Maya grows  involving regular exercise and a nutritious diet. Furthermore  they should understand the future risks  including the possibility of endocarditis and heart failure. Genetic counseling may also be beneficial for future family planning as there is a familial relationship in the history.    Conclusion: Maya's case emphasizes the importance of meticulous newborn screening  the relevance of family history in diagnosing congenital diseases  as well as closely monitoring and managing such conditions.
13,9,66,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial66,"Patient Presentation:   The patient  a six-month-old female  named Madison  is diagnosed with congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot. She is Caucasian with parents of Scandinavian descent  living in the urban region of Chicago  Illinois. As the first child of a 28-year-old mother and 30-year-old father  her preterm birth at thirty-four weeks was marked with some difficulties. The parents reported noticing excessive crying  rapid breathing  fatigue during feeding  and a bluish skin color  indicating episodes of """"Tet spells"""".   Past Medical History:  The patient's birth was complicated due to premature rupture of membranes leading to premature birth. Her neonatal period was complicated by respiratory distress syndrome for which she received surfactant and was on continuous positive airway pressure in NICU. An initial physical examination revealed a loud systolic murmur  leading to a suspicion of a heart anomaly.  Diagnostic Test:  An echocardiogram confirmed the presence of the four defects that characterize Tetralogy of Fallot - pulmonary stenosis  ventricular septal defect  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta. Further  a pulse oximetry reading consistently showed abnormally low oxygen levels in her blood.   Family History:  The patient's family history reveals no diagnosis of congenital heart defects  though the mother had gestational diabetes  managed adequately with diet modification. There's no history of hereditary illnesses such as cystic fibrosis or other congenital abnormalities. No history of drug abuse  alcoholism  or smoking was reported among the parents or extended family.  Social History:  The patient's family belongs to the upper-middle-class economic stratum  with no exposure to illicit drugs  smoking or passive smoking. Her parents are well-educated non-smokers leading a healthy lifestyle  with the mother working as a school teacher and the father as an architect.   Clinical Course:  Madison's case has been discussed with a pediatric cardiologist who suggested the need for surgical repair if """"tet spells"""" persist. While awaiting surgery  she is on beta-blocker treatment to decrease the symptoms associated with 'tet spells'.   Conclusion:  Attentive and watchful documentation of Madison's clinical and social history along with her family history assists in careful consideration of all factors contributing to her current health state. This thorough examination will continue to play a pivotal role in her future therapeutic plan  her response to the therapy  and her long-term prognosis."
13,9,67,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial67,"Case Presentation:  Patient Profile:  The subject under discussion is a 2-year-old male  named Matthew  of Asian descent. He resides with his parents in the urban area of San Diego  California  where he was born. The parents reported that the child was delivered full-term with no complications during the mother's pregnancy.  Presenting Problem:  Matthew was brought to the pediatrician after his parents noticed he was displaying signs of fatigue quickly than usual during playtime. He also had rapid breathing at times and a recurrent cough. A bluish coloration was noticeable on the child’s skin  especially the fingertips and around his lips.  Past Medical History:  The child has no previous medical history. His vaccinations are up to date as per the pediatric healthcare schedule. He has had no major illnesses or hospitalizations before this.   Family History:  His father has a prevalent history of Hyperlipidemia but is otherwise healthy. His mother has no known medical issues. There’s no known history of congenital heart diseases in the immediate or extended family.  Physical Examination and Diagnosis:  Upon physical examination  Matthew had an oxygen saturation level of 83%. A murmur was noticed upon auscultation. Upon further diagnostic testing with an echocardiogram  a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot was made. This congenital heart defect is characterized by four issues: a ventricular septal defect  pulmonary valve stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta.   Treatment and Management Plan:  The primary treatment for Tetralogy of Fallot is surgery  which pediatric cardiology specialists usually recommend within the first year of life. Until surgery can be arranged  the child was started on Propranolol to help in managing symptoms and prevent """"Tet"""" spells.   Relevance:  This case is imperative due to the rarity and severity of the condition. Early detection and correct treatment would afford Matthew a good prognosis and an almost normal life expectancy. Support and guidance for the parents also need to be provided since the psychological challenges of parenting a child with a chronic illness can be significant. Regular monitoring and follow-up care with a team of specialists  including cardiologists and pediatricians  are necessary in such congenital heart diseases.  Limitations:  This case is based on a hypothetical patient and aimed for educational purposes. In real life  a patient's presentation can vary  and management plans may differ based on the specific clinical scenario at hand. Consultation with appropriate specialists and effectively engaging the patient and family are key to managing such complex conditions."

13,9,69,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial69,Patient Case Presentation  Demographics: The patient  referred to as E.B.  is a 15-day-old male newborn of Korean ethnicity. E.B. was brought in by his parents due to concern about cyanosis noticed shortly after the child was born. He was delivered at full term without complications. E.B. has one older sibling  a four-year-old sister  who does not exhibit any health issues.   Past Medical History: Aside from his recent birth  E.B. does not have any prior medical history. His neonatal period has been significant for failure to thrive  central cyanosis  and difficulty feeding. He was born at a community hospital and according to his records  had a normal birth weight of 3.2kg. No significant health issues were noted at birth.   Family History: The parents reported no known cases of congenital heart disease in their families. The mother had a normal pregnancy and did not use any tobacco  alcohol  or illicit substances. She is a 35-year-old with no significant medical history. E.B's father is a healthy 38-year-old.   Clinical Presentation: Physical examination revealed a centrally cyanotic and slightly lethargic infant. His respiratory rate was elevated at 60 breaths per minute  and he exhibited mild subcostal retractions. His pulse oximetry reading in room air was 75%. He weighed 2.6kg  reflecting mild failure to thrive compared to his birth weight. Upon auscultation  a grade 3/6 systolic murmur localized to the left upper sternal border was noted.  Investigations: An electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed right ventricular hypertrophy and right axis deviation suggestive of congenital heart disease. Further  an echocardiogram demonstrated a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  which consists of ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)  and overriding aorta.   Summary and Diagnosis: In summary  E.B. is a 15-day old male neonate with Tetralogy of Fallot  presented due to cyanosis and feeding difficulty. His symptoms and the heart murmur heard on physical examination  in addition to results from the EKG and echocardiogram  confirmed the diagnosis. His condition will require surgical management for definitive correction.   Plan: E.B. will be referred to a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon for consultation and probable intervention. Expected prognosis is favorable following surgical intervention  although lifelong cardiac follow-up will be essential. He will also require nutritional support to address impending failure to thrive. His parents will be offered genetic counseling to understand the potential implications for future offspring. 
13,9,70,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial70,Patient Case Presentation: Pediatric Congenital Heart Disease   Patient Profile: Our subject is a 2-year-old female child  hailing from a Hispanic family in the rural area of southern Texas.   Presenting Complaint: She was brought to the clinic due to recurrent episodes of shortness of breath  excessive sweating  and feeding difficulties. These symptoms have been more frequent and severe for the past two weeks.   Past Medical History: On further evaluation  it was discovered that the parents had not followed a strict schedule of prenatal checkups. Pre-existing maternal conditions such as diabetes  intake of certain medications  and substance abuse have been excluded. The child has had recurrent respiratory infections since she was 9 months old  and her developmental milestones are somewhat delayed.  Family History: On eliciting the family history  it was noted that her mother's elder brother underwent corrective surgery for some kind of heart disease in his early childhood  but the exact details are not available. Her parents are otherwise healthy.  Examination and Investigations: On physical examination  the child appeared to be underweight and slightly pale. Cardiac auscultation revealed a murmur. Chest X-ray findings were suggestive of cardiomegaly. An ECHO was requested  which showed a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) with left to right shunting.   Diagnosis: Based on the child's signs  symptoms  physical examination findings  and ECHO report  a diagnosis of VSD  which is a type of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)  was made.  Management: In consultation with the Pediatric Cardiologist  it was decided that the child should be stabilized with heart medicines such as diuretics and ACE inhibitors ahead of surgical intervention. She will eventually be scheduled for a VSD closure procedure. Besides medical treatment  the child would require supportive care with good nutrition and physiotherapy to catch up on her delayed milestones. Her parents were provided with counseling and education about her condition  and genetics counseling was recommended due to the family history of congenital heart disease.  Follow-up: The case plan includes regular follow-ups  alongside pre-surgery and post-surgery care. Additionally  complete vaccinations are suggested to prevent further infections  and growth parameters will be assessed in each visit.   In summary  this case represents a common pediatric cardiovascular condition due to gaps in prenatal care and possibly a genetic predisposition. The child was presented late due to a lack of awareness and possibly due to the rural family's logistical issues. This case highlights the importance of genetic screening  prenatal checkups  postnatal checkups  and parental education in early detection and intervention in congenital heart diseases.
13,9,71,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial71,Patient Identification:  The patient  a 2-year-old Caucasian male  named Tyler Johnson  arrived with his mother at our children’s cardiology clinic. The reason for the consultation was a concern raised during regular examination with the pediatrician  who found an abnormal heart sound  termed a murmur. The patient lives in the metropolitan area of Atlanta  GA  and there are no known environmental factors possibly contributing to his condition.  Past Medical History:  The patient has no significant past medical history. He was delivered at term and had normal growth and development markers. His vaccinations are up-to-date  and he had regular pediatric checkups. There have been no previous hospitalizations or known allergies. He has no diseases other than occasional  usual childhood ailments like common cold.  Present Illness:  Apart from the detected heart murmur  Tyler’s mother has not reported any symptoms related to heart disease. According to her  he has normal appetite and sleep pattern and appears active for a child of his age. There is no history of breathlessness  fatigue  or episodes of bluish discoloration of the lips or skin.  Family History:  Upon investigation  it turns out that Tyler's father was diagnosed with a bicuspid aortic valve  a congenital heart defect  at the age of 30. This is noteworthy as congenital heart defects can be inherited. There is no history of similar heart diseases on the mother’s side of the family.  Socioeconomic Status:  The family falls in the middle-income bracket. Both parents are employed  with the father working as a sales representative and the mother as a school teacher. They have adequate health insurance coverage. Tyler has one older sibling  a four-year-old sister who is healthy.  Diagnostic Evaluation and Management:  Echocardiography was performed which revealed the presence of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Following the diagnosis  a detailed discussion about the nature of the problem  management  and future health implications was conducted with Tyler’s mother.  The cardiologist recommended conservative management for the time being  with regular monitoring of Tyler's growth and heart condition. As he is asymptomatic  surgery would not be considered unless symptoms develop or if there's no spontaneous closure of the VSD. Parental guidance about the recognition of potential symptoms like fatigue  failure to gain weight  rapid breathing  or recurrent respiratory infections was provided.  The presentation of this case should emphasize the importance of recognizing subtle clinical signs such as heart murmurs in children and timely referral to a specialist. Due to the family history of a congenital heart defect  parents were educated about the likelihood of recurrence in future pregnancies and the option of prenatal diagnostic procedures. The case should be followed up regularly to monitor the patient's progress and update the management plan as necessary.
13,9,72,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial72,"Patient Profile: The patient is a 5-month-old  Hispanic male named Roberto. He was born full term by normal vaginal delivery but was noted to have bluish discoloration (cyanosis) immediately after birth.  Medical History: Roberto was diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a form of congenital heart disease  on his second day of life when a murmur was detected during a routine examination. This is a condition characterized by an abnormal heart structure that leads to decreased oxygenation of the blood. He has developmental delay and has been hospitalized twice due to cyanotic episodes  known as """"Tet spells.""""  Family History: There is no history of congenital heart diseases in his family. His mother  age 24  is a non-smoker with no reported drug use during pregnancy and was compliant with her antenatal check-ups. The father  age 28  is a smoker but has no known major illnesses. Roberto has a healthy 4-year-old sister  Lucia.  Treatment History: Management of Roberto's condition  thus far  has primarily been palliative  using a combination of medications  such as beta-blockers and prostaglandins to lower heart rate and maintain ductal patency.  Discussion: Roberto's case is complicated by his developmental delay and frequent episodes of cyanosis  which increase his risk for CNS injury. He will require surgery (such as Blalock-Taussig shunt or complete repair when he gains weight) to improve oxygen circulation. Parents have expressed concerns regarding surgical risks and the long-term outcome of Roberto's condition.  Recommendations: Roberto's parents should be counseled regarding the disease's nature  the need for surgery  potential challenges  and regular follow-up. There's a need to customize a care plan  which includes the social worker  physical therapist  genetic counselor  and pediatric cardiologist to improve Roberto's outcome. Early intervention services should be put in place to address Roberto's developmental delay.  Pertinent Investigation: Roberto's initial echocardiogram showed right ventricle hypertrophy and a large ventricular septal defect (VSD). An ECG demonstrated right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. Also  blood tests showed an increased number of red blood cells (polycythemia)  a common feature in cyanotic heart disease.  Prognosis: The prognosis of TOF has greatly improved with advancements in surgical techniques  with most children leading a normal life. However  ongoing considerations include developmental delay  long-term cardiac function  and potential future surgeries. Regular cardiac follow-ups after the surgery will be required."

Past Medical History:  Sarah was born through normal vaginal delivery at 39 weeks with no birth complications. She weighed 7 lbs at birth and her growth and development seemed normal until about two months after birth when her parents noticed she was not gaining weight and seemed generally fatigued. She hasn't had any surgery  hospitalization  infections  allergies or significant illnesses to report.   Family History:  There is no history of congenital heart disease  Marfan syndrome  or connective tissue disorders in the family. Both parents are nonsmokers and her siblings are healthy with no significant health issues.  Findings:  Upon physical examination  it was found that Sarah's heartbeats were louder than usual  with a murmur detected. There were also signs of cyanosis  evident from a bluish tint on her lips and fingernails. Sarah also showed signs of underweight and developmental delays. A chest X-ray was recommended which showed an enlarged heart. An Echocardiogram was also done and had significant findings.  Diagnosis:  The diagnosis came back positive for congenital heart disease specifically a ventricular septal defect (VSD)  after a detailed echocardiogram assessment. Other findings included right ventricular hypertrophy and increased pulmonary blood flow.  Management:  Sarah was referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further management in line with the identified VSD. She was scheduled for a cardiac catheterization procedure. The parents were educated about the situation and were assured that the defect could be effectively managed. Nutritional advice was also provided to ensure good health while awaiting and after the procedure.    Follow Up:  Sarah was scheduled for a follow-up appointment two weeks after the procedure and then regular appointments afterward depending on the post-procedure recovery.   Conclusion:  Early diagnosis and management of congenital heart disease  such as VSD  is highly critical to prevent complications and ensure normal growth and development. The multidisciplinary care and parental education are essential for holistic patient treatment and management.
13,9,74,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial74,Patient Presentation:   The patient  Mr. J.S  is a 2-year-old Caucasian male brought to the hospital by his parents because of frequent difficulty in breathing and cyanosis  especially noted during feeding or excitement.   The Child was born at term and had an uncomplicated delivery but soon after birth developed mild respiratory distress. At the time  the child was noted to have a grade II/VI systolic heart murmur but was otherwise healthy  and the family was reassured by the delivery team that murmurs were common and often resolved spontaneously.   However  over the past 2 years  the family has noticed progressive breathlessness  profuse sweating  and poor weight gain on appropriately balanced nutrition. There is also a history of pallor and syncopal attacks. Intermittent fever was also reported over the last year  likely due to multiple lower respiratory tract infections.   Family History: The family history is significant in that the father of the child has also been diagnosed with congenital heart disease (Tetralogy of Fallot) but is currently fit and asymptomatic. No other relevant history in other family members.   Examination: Physical examination reveals central cyanosis  clubbing  and a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at left upper sternal border. Significant pallor was also noted.  Further investigations: Echocardiogram was done and has shown a large VSD with overriding aorta and right ventricular outflow obstruction. The findings were suggestive of Tetralogy of Fallot.  Possible Interventions and Treatment Plan: Given the patient's age  symptoms  and significant cyanosis  surgical intervention is favored. The patient's case was discussed with the pediatric cardiac surgery team  and a decision was made to plan for corrective surgery. Parents were counseled about the procedure  its risks  and benefits  and they agreed to move forward with the surgery.  The case emphasizes the importance of timely referral to a Paediatric Cardiologist  as early detection of such conditions enhances the timely commencement of management thus reducing morbidity and mortality. It also underscores the need for detailed family history  thorough physical examination  and appropriate investigations in pediatric patients presenting with cyanosis.
13,9,75,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial75,Patient Details: The patient is a 2-month-old female infant born full-term via cesarean delivery  who initially appeared healthy but later presented with signs of respiratory distress. The parents noted that she tires easily during feeding. They also noticed a blue coloration of her skin  primarily her lips and fingers  especially during feeding or when she was crying. She was brought to the clinic for a scheduled well-baby check-up.  Demographics: The patient lives in a suburban community clinic's catchment area  coming from a middle-income  Caucasian family. Both parents are in their late 30s. Her father is an accountant and her mother a school teacher. She is the first child of healthy  nonconsanguineous parents. The family has no known environmental exposure.  Past Medical History: The prenatal course was uneventful  mother had regular prenatal visits. The patient was born at 39 weeks with a weight of 3.5 kilograms. No neonatal complications were observed  and the infant was discharged two days post-delivery.  Family History: There is no known family history of congenital heart disease or other genetic disorders. The mother’s pregnancy was not associated with any known risk factors such as maternal rubella  gestational diabetes  or substance abuse. Neither parent has any diagnosed cardiac abnormality.  Clinical Presentation: At her check-up  physical examination showed the infant's oxygen saturation level at 85% while at rest  dropping to around 70% during crying or feeding. She showed signs of tachypnea and mild clubbing was observed in her fingers. A cardiac exam revealed a loud systolic murmur.   Further Investigations: Given her symptoms and the findings on the physical examination  the infant was suspected to have cyanotic congenital heart disease. An echocardiogram was ordered and has confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot.  Plan: She has been referred to a pediatric cardiologist for confirmation of the diagnosis and further treatment planning. Open heart surgery to correct the defects is the likely plan  but the timing and details will depend on the cardiologist's evaluation. Post-surgical care will likely include close monitoring and potential pharmacotherapy. Genetic counseling to assess possible genetic causes and future risk in potential siblings may also be recommended.   This case underscores the importance of routine well-baby checks in early detection and management of congenital conditions like heart disease  which can greatly improve survival and long-term outcomes.
13,9,76,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial76,Case Presentation:   Patient Identifier: Mr. X   Demographics: Mr. X is a 25-year-old Caucasian male who is currently residing in Atlanta  Georgia. He is an accountant and leads a lightly active lifestyle  with intermittent participation in recreational sports. His diet is generally balanced  but he admits to occasional fast food consumption.  Present Complaint: Mr. X approached our facility complaining of fatigue  occasional shortness of breath  and bouts of lightheadedness  particularly after physical activity.  Past Medical History: Mr. X had his last complete physical examination two years ago  at which point he was deemed to be in good health. He does not have any known allergies  and he's never been hospitalized or undergone any surgery prior to this point. He was diagnosed with mild asthma during his teenage years  for which he uses an inhaler as needed.  Family History: His father died at the age of 50 due to a heart attack and had a history of hypertension. His paternal grandfather had also suffered from heart disease. His mother is living and healthy  but her father had diabetes. He has no siblings.  Social History:  Mr. X is a non-consumer of alcohol and tobacco  and there's no history of recreational drug use.  Clinical Findings: On examination  a stethoscope shows a systolic murmur. His blood pressure was within normal limits and his pulse was slightly elevated. The EKG showed structural defects  while the echo-Doppler study confirmed congenital heart disease  more precisely an atrial septal defect.  Investigations: Subsequent studies  including a chest X-ray and cardiac MRI  were conducted showing an enlarged heart  supporting the ASH diagnosis.   Plan for Management: Considering Mr. X's age  symptomatology  and the diagnostic findings  it was recommended to proceed with corrective heart surgery given the size of the defect and the strain on his heart. Before the procedure  he was referred to a dietician to optimize his nutrition and to a fitness specialist to strengthen his cardiovascular system.  Education & Counseling: Education was provided about the complexity of his condition  the proposed surgical procedure  risks  benefits  alternatives  diet modification  lifestyle modification  and the potential impact on his future life  including the occupational aspect.

13,9,77,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial77,"Patient Details:  - Patient Name: Anthony K. - Age: 2 months - Gender: Male - Race: Hispanic - Place of residence: Texas  USA  Presenting Complaint: Anthony was brought into the clinic by his parents. They reported that Anthony has been having episodes of rapid breathing  poor feeding  and he appears to be bluish in color from time to time especially around the lips.  Past Medical History: The child was born at term with no complications during pregnancy or delivery. His birth weight was within the normal range. However  he was hospitalized immediately after birth due to respiratory distress. He has been frequently hospitalized with recurrent chest infections since then. His growth rate is below average for his age.  Family History: His mother reported there is a family history of congenital heart disease; his maternal uncle had a similar condition that was corrected with surgery.  Clinical Examination: On clinical examination  the child appeared to be in respiratory distress with an increased respiratory rate. He had poor peripheral circulation with cynanosis and below average body weight for his age. Chest examination revealed a hyperactive precordium and a heart murmur.  Investigations: Chest X-ray showed an enlarged heart. Echocardiography confirmed a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a complicated congenital heart disease.  Discussion and Plan: Anthony was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect called Tetralogy of Fallot  one of the most common types of congenital heart diseases. This condition involves four anatomical abnormalities of the heart. It is interesting to note that this condition can have a diverse clinical presentation which mainly depends on the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.  Anthony's case is significant because his cyanotic episodes (""""blue spells"""") will increase in frequency and severity as he grows  potentially leading to a life-threatening situation. He would need to undergo corrective surgery  to not only improve his quality of life but also to improve his odds of survival.  His parents were counselled about the nature of the disease  prognosis  the necessity of open-heart surgery  and the associated risks and benefits. This is crucial in ensuring parental understanding and involvement in the management process  which is essential for a condition like Anthony's.  His case also underscores the importance of genetic counselling  given the presence of a similar condition in the family. This will help the family understand not just the disorder better but also its implications for future pregnancies. Anthony is scheduled for open-heart surgery in the upcoming weeks  upon securing consent from his parents.  Early intervention in such cases enhances the child's chance at having a near-normal life with controlled symptoms of the disease and fewer complications. The parents were advised on the importance of regular follow-up post-surgery to track the progress of Anthony's condition. They were also assured that children who receive proper treatment for Tetralogy of Fallot often lead healthy  productive lives."
13,9,78,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial78,Patient Overview: The patient is a male Caucasian infant  age six months  named John. His parents provided all the necessary medical and family history.   Patient History: John was delivered full term with no reported issues during pregnancy or birth. A slight murmur was noted during post delivery examination at the hospital by the pediatrician  leading to further investigation. Both parents report no known prior medical conditions. The mother notes an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. All vaccinations and well-check visits are up-to-date.   Presenting Symptoms: During John's latest early wellness review  the pediatrician identified ongoing concerns about the previously identified heart murmur. John's parents also reported unusual fatigue during feeding or play  a blue coloration to his skin particularly during these periods of exertion  and slowed growth.  Family History: Neither parent has known congenital heart disease nor do they have a family history of it. Both parents are of average height and weight  with minimal past medical history. Their families exhibit no patterns of cardiac conditions or early-onset heart disease.  Clinical Investigations: An initial pediatric cardiac consultation  upon hearing the murmur and observing the symptoms described by the parents  led to an echocardiogram on the suspicion of congenital heart disease. The echocardiogram revealed a ventricular septal defect (VSD)  confirming the diagnosis of congenital heart disease. John’s VSD is moderate in size.   Other clinical investigations such as 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG)  chest X-ray (for heart and lung structures)  and blood tests (to assess general health and rule out other potential conditions) were also conducted. ECG showcased abnormal heart rhythm and the chest X-ray displayed the characteristic “boot-shaped” heart with a right ventricular enlargement.  Management: Given John's young age and the size of the VSD  immediate surgery is not the current course of action. Regular follow-up visits and symptom management are recommended. Pharmacologic management using ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may be used to manage heart failure symptoms in more severe cases.   Summary: John  a 6-month old Caucasian infant  has been diagnosed with a congenital heart disease  specifically a moderate ventricular septal defect. His clinical presentation  coupled with the echocardiogram and other diagnostic tests  confirm this diagnosis. His current management plan is monitoring symptom advancement and regular cardiology follow-ups. Medical management will be considered if heart failure symptoms become more severe. The family has been advised about the need for early intervention if John’s condition deteriorates.
13,9,79,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial79,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 1-year-old male infant diagnosed with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). He hails from a middle-class family residing in Seattle  Washington. His ethnicity is Caucasian. He was diagnosed with CHD during fetal anatomic scanning performed at the 20th week of gestation.  Past Medical History:  The patient  since birth  has been facing problems associated with feeding and weight gain and has experienced bouts of heavy sweating  especially during feeding. He has experienced episodes of cyanosis and was admitted for recurrent respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and pneumonia two times in the last year. His past medical records reveal a history of dyspnea.  Family History:  There is no family history of congenital heart diseases or any other genetic abnormalities. However  the mother had complications during pregnancy and was diagnosed with gestational diabetes  which she was able to control with diet and exercise.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient has a significantly lower percentile (<5%) for weight and height corresponding to his age group. He presents with mild cyanosis and shortness of breath. On auscultation  a systolic heart murmur was heard. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) indicates abnormal heart rhythms. A chest X-ray showed an enlarged heart suggestive of cardiac hypertrophy.  Investigations:  The patient underwent a cardiac echocardiogram which showed a ventricular septal defect (VSD) confirming the diagnosis of CHD. A Complete Blood Count (CBC) showed polycythemia  a common finding in patients with cyanotic CHD.   Management:  The patient has been advised surgical correction of the VSD. He is on treatment with diuretics for his symptoms and to manage heart failure. He has been referred to various specialists involving pediatric cardiology  pediatric dietitian  and pediatric physical therapy. Regular follow-ups are advised to monitor the growth of the infant and the disease. The parents have been provided with counseling to help manage the disease at home and improve the nutrition of the child. Genetic counseling is also advised for parent education and future family planning.   Conclusion:  This case presentation of the infant diagnosed with CHD reiterates the importance of prenatal diagnosis and the multifactorial approach required to ensure increased survival rates and an improved quality of life for patients diagnosed with congenital heart disease.
13,9,80,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial80,"Case Presentation:  Patient Information:  The patient is a seven-month-old Hispanic female  currently presenting symptoms that are consistent with congenic heart disease (CHD).  Presenting Issue: The patient’s parents observed her gradually developing symptoms like shortness of breath  difficulty feeding  and slow growth/ weight gain over the last couple of months. Most recently  they noticed a bluish tinge in the baby's skin  particularly her lips and fingernails.  Past Medical History: The patient was born at 38 weeks  with an observed birth weight of 3.1kg. Her perinatal period was generally uneventful  and she has received the necessary vaccinations as per her age. She has no history of any allergies  surgeries  or conditions that required hospitalization.  Family History: Her family history is relevant for cardiovascular disease  particularly on her mother’s side. Both patient's maternal grandparents have a history of hypertension and heart disease. The patient's mother had been diagnosed with mild mitral valve regurgitation during her pregnancy but she did not require surgical intervention.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  the baby was found to be alert but looking a bit cyanotic. Her heart rate was a bit high at 170 beats per minute and her breathing was labored at 45 breaths per minute. Auscultation revealed a loud """"whooshing"""" noise in the upper left part of the heart  which the doctor identified as a heart murmur.  Investigations: She has undergone an electrocardiogram (ECG)  chest x-ray  and subsequent echocardiogram. The ECG revealed tachycardia  her chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly  and her echocardiogram indicated a large ventricular septal defect (VSD).  Diagnosis: Based on the above-mentioned findings and symptoms  the patient was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect- specifically ventricular septal defect.   Management Plan: The patient will be referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further consultation. The parents have been informed about the prognosis and treatment options  including the possibility of open-heart surgery. The baby will be closely observed to monitor her oxygen levels  respiration rate  and progress in the goal of weight gain. Medications may be prescribed to manage her symptoms until a more permanent solution is decided.   The whole healthcare team will liaise with the patient's parents  providing them with ample support and reassurance during this challenging time. This case warrants ongoing monitoring and coordination of care solutions to enhance the patient's quality of life and overall health outcomes."
13,9,81,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial81,Patient Case: Congenital Heart Disease  Demographics: The patient under discussion is a four-month-old Caucasian male  born on December 20  2020  in Chicago  Illinois. The child was born full term with the normal birth weight of 3.4 kg and no immediate complications were reported.  Presenting Diagnosis: The child received a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a congenicital heart disease that was identified during a routine pediatric evaluation when a murmur was detected.  Past Medical History: Since birth  the patient has shown signs of mild cyanosis  especially during feedings and crying. However  no significant health issues were reported before the diagnosis. He has had regular vaccinations and has been growing at the expected rate.  Family History: There is no known family history of congenital heart disease  although the child's maternal grandfather did have hypertension and passed away from a heart attack at the age of 60. His parents are in good health and neither smoke nor drink alcohol.   Diagnostic Evaluation: Post detection of the murmur  an echocardiogram was performed confirming the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot. The child’s oxygen saturation ranged from 75% – 85%  providing further confirmation of the disease. The four components of the disease were observed: ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and aortic dextroposition.  Treatment Plan: A plan has been initiated to conduct a complete repair surgery between 4-6 months of age depending on the child's health status  weight gain  and symptoms. The surgery aims to improve the blood flow to the lungs and correct the septal defect.  In the interim  the child will be closely monitored. Frequent pediatric evaluations and parental education on the handling of cyanotic spells are ongoing. The parents have demonstrated comprehension and adeptness in managing the child's needs.  Prognosis: With successful surgical intervention and post-operative care  the prognosis for this child is favorable. He is expected to have a normal life with routine check-ups to monitor heart function. As with any congenital heart disease  lifelong cardiological follow-up is recommended.   This case demonstrates the need for physicians to maintain a high index of suspicion in paediatric cases presenting with non-specific symptoms  such as cyanosis and lethargy  ensuring early diagnosis and management for congenital heart diseases. 
13,9,82,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial82,Patient Case:  Patient: D.R.  Age: 3 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Location: New York  USA   Presenting Issue:  D.R. has been diagnosed with congenital heart disease and has shown symptoms such as shortness of breath  rapid heartbeat  frequent bouts of pneumonia  and an inability to keep up with other children of the same age in terms of physical activity.  Past Medical History: D.R. was born with a ventricular septal defect which was detected at birth. He was also diagnosed with Down syndrome  which often carries an increased risk of congenital heart disease.  Family History: There is a history of congenital heart disease on the mother's side of the family. D.R.'s maternal uncle had a similar defect but had undergone successful surgical correction. D.R.'s parents do not have any cardiovascular disease. No genetic disorders  such as Down syndrome  exist in the family's medical history aside from D.R.  Surgical History:  D.R. has not yet undergone any surgeries.  Drug History: D.R. has no known drug allergies. He has been on a course of antibiotics after his recurrent bouts of pneumonia.   Diagnostic Findings: Physical examination showed D.R. to be smaller compared to his peers  with a slightly cyanotic appearance. Cardiovascular examination revealed a parasternal heave and a soft mid-diastolic murmur. Echocardiography confirmed the large unrepaired ventricular septal defect and showed evidence of severe pulmonary hypertension.  Plan of Care:  Careful monitoring  dietary interventions  and symptom relief for pulmonary hypertension are the primary steps. An increased calorie diet is recommended to support growth. Early surgical intervention is required to correct the defect and relieve pulmonary hypertension. Consequently  the surgical outlook and the mother's anxiety regarding the patient's Down Syndrome are to be managed with appropriate counseling.   This case highlights the complex interplay between Down Syndrome and congenital heart disease. The team will work closely with neurodevlopmental specialists in managing D.R.'s overall health. Regular follow-up assessments would be crucial in monitoring the patient's development and managing any arising complications.   The long term monitoring will include symptomatic treatment for heart failure  regular monitoring for signs of increased pulmonary blood flow and counseling the parents regarding the nature and prognosis of the condition.
13,9,83,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial83,Patient Information:  Mr. A. Samuel  a 5-year-old Caucasian male presented by mother Mrs. Angela Samuel had been diagnosed with congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot  shortly after his birth.   Past Medical History: The patient was born prematurely at 33 weeks. He was diagnosed using prenatal ultrasound and the diagnosis was confirmed after birth using Echocardiography. The combined signs were Supreme Ventricular Septum (VSD)  Pulmonary Stenosis (PS)  Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH)  and an Overriding Aorta. His medical history also includes surgery at age two  which was a complete intracardiac repair. Mr. A. Samuel experienced cyanosis  displayed poor growth  occasional difficulty breathing  and fatigue following physical activities which have improved after the surgery.  Family History: His family history incorporates his father having a mild form of congenital heart disease which was repaired during his childhood. His paternal grandmother was also diagnosed with a cardiac abnormality.   Present Complaints:  The child is experiencing occasional bouts of fatigue  particularly after strenuous physical activity. Despite these fatigue spells and his existing health condition  he is generally in good spirits and his development aligns with normal growth parameters for his age.  Current Medications: Mr. A. Samuel continues with regular follow-ups to monitor his progress and is on long-term medications including diuretics  Digoxin  and aspirin.  Physical Exam: Upon physical examination  you observe a surgical scar on his chest from past surgery and a slightly compromised development compared to children of his age. There was a palpable thrill at the left lower sternal border. His weight and height are below the 25th percentile for his age  but this has been consistent since his post-op recovery.   Assessment and Plan: Mild fatiguing  in this case  could be a sign of right ventricular failure or arrhythmia. However  considering Mr. A. Samuel's overall positive health trajectory  it's equally likely that these are just the result of normal childhood activities. The plan includes suggesting a detail cardiac examination including 24-hour holter monitoring  a repeat echocardiography to see the regression of RVH and ruling out residual VSD. Importantly  the parents have been advised to limit the child's strenuous physical activities  ensuring he takes rest periods during play. Further consultation with a pediatric cardiology specialist will be scheduled immediately if any sign of heart failure or other cardiac complications emerge. Additionally  close collaboration with a dietitian will be maintained to monitor his nutritional status considering his slow growth pattern.
13,9,84,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial84,Case Presentation  Patient Profile: A 6-month-old Hispanic male infant  identified as J.D  was referred to the pediatric cardiology clinic following concerns raised during his routine immunization check-up.   Presenting Complaint: During the check-up  an irregular heartbeat and a heart murmur were detected. The infant’s mother reports that J.D has been irritable  is sweating excessively  often looks pale  and displays feeding difficulties. He also seems to get out of breath more frequently than his elder sibling used to at the same age.   Past Medical History: J.D was born at full term after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. His birth weight was average  and he met early developmental milestones at appropriate stages. However  his weight gain has been lower than expected in the last two months  and he shows signs of fatigue and decreased activity levels. He has no prior hospitalizations or surgeries and no known allergies.  Family History: The infant’s older sibling and parents have no known medical issues; however  a paternal uncle reportedly underwent heart surgery for an unspecified defect during infancy.   Examination: On physical examination  J.D was alert and active but noticeably small for his age  placed in the 5th percentile for his weight and 10th percentile for his height. He displayed mild tachypnea  with an irregular pulse of 130 beats per minute. There were no neurodevelopmental abnormalities observed. Auscultation of the chest revealed a consistent heart murmur.  Investigation: Laboratory studies  including a full blood count  and kidney and liver function tests  were largely normal. An electrocardiogram showed a regular rhythm with signs of chamber enlargement. A subsequent echocardiogram revealed a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)  indicating that the infant is likely suffering from this congenital heart disease.  Plan: J.D’s VSD was of moderate size requiring specialist management. A follow-up appointment was made with the same pediatric cardiologist in 3 months to monitor his progress and decide on surgical intervention if necessary. Advice was given to the parents about the early detection of heart failure symptoms and maintaining the child’s nutrition and general health.  This case emphasizes the importance of routine check-ups in early infancy  which can lead to early detection and treatment of serious conditions like congenital heart disease.
13,9,85,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial85,"Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Peterson is a six-month-old Caucasian male who was brought in for a regular pediatric visit by his parents. They report that he seems to tire easily during feeding and appears cyanotic during those episodes. On physical exam  there is noted to be a murmur. Birth history was uncomplicated  and prenatal screening was reportedly normal. The child's growth parameters are below the pediatric standard. James lives with his parents and a three-year-old sibling in a suburban environment.  Relevant Past Medical History:  Past medical history is significant for frequent upper respiratory tract infections since birth which doctors initially associated with a immature immune system. Given the frequency  this could also be related to his congenital heart disease diagnosis.  Family History:  Family history has revealed that his paternal grandfather was diagnosed with a congenital heart disorder and passed away at 40 due to heart failure complications. Both parents  ages 28 and 30  are reportedly healthy. His unmarried sibling is in good health and has reached all developmental milestones.  Pertinent Information:  A subsequent echocardiogram at the health institution revealed that James Peterson had a Tetralogy of Fallot - the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease diagnosed in infants. This diagnosis includes four anatomical anomalies of the heart  including ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  a misplaced aorta and a thickened right ventricular wall (right ventricular hypertrophy).  The parents had reported that the baby often becomes blue (cyanotic) during feeding or when he is upset. This is a classic symptom of """"TET spells"""" associated with Tetralogy of Fallot.  Treatment Plan:  James' future management will include surgical intervention to correct the anatomical defects. Currently  a comprehensive cardiac evaluation is being recommended. His parents have been educated about the disease and are being counseled for the surgical option. Further management includes monitoring James' growth and development  ensuring he is meeting proper milestones considering his disease  and providing support and education about how to manage potential complications at home.  The above case illustrates the importance of early identification and management of congenital heart diseases  like Tetralogy of Fallot  for better patient outcomes. Recognizing signs like frequent cyanotic episodes and growth deviations in line with family history  should alert healthcare professionals to perform relevant diagnostic evaluations."
13,9,86,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial86,Patient Presentation  Patient Information: Mr. J is a 22-year-old Caucasian male  recently diagnosed with congenital heart disease.   Medical History: He presented to the cardiologist's office after experiencing bouts of fatigue  shortness of breath  and fainting spells. He was previously healthy with no significant medical history. Other than occasional alcohol intake and smoking  he denies drug use. There were no reported occurrences or episodes of chest pain or palpitations. He has no known allergies.  Demographics: Mr. J hails from suburban Washington  D.C.  lives with his parents  and currently studies Computer Science at a local university.    Family History: His father had hypertension  yet died of unrelated causes  and his mother has been recently diagnosed with type II diabetes. There's no known family history of congenital heart disease  early onset heart disease  or sudden death.  Examination & Diagnosis: On physical examination  lumbar clubbing was worrying. Furthermore  a faint murmur was heard on listening to his heart  suggesting there might be an irregular flow of blood through his heart. An echocardiogram confirmed the presence of a congenital malformation - Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  which included pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  overriding aorta  and ventricular septal defect.   Treatment & Outcome: Given the severity of his condition and persisting symptoms  Mr. J was recommended for a complete surgical repair. The surgery successfully corrected the four defects of TOF  and dramatically improved the patient's symptoms. He was strongly advised to quit smoking and moderate his alcohol intake. Mr. J has been scheduled for regular follow-ups with the cardiologist.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering congenital heart defects in young adults  even without pertinent family history  who present with cardiovascular symptoms not otherwise accounted for by lifestyle risk factors. Comprehensive evaluation  including physical examination and echocardiography  was crucial in establishing the correct diagnosis and prompt treatment  ultimately improving Mr. J’s prognosis.
13,9,87,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial87,Patient Information:  Mr. X is a 12-year-old male of African-American descent  currently presenting with signs of fatigue  difficulty during physical activities  and unexplained rapid breathing or breathlessness. He is a single child and lives with his parents in New Orleans. He is a 7th grade student with a straight 'A' academic record.   Medical History:  Mr. X was born full term  and the parents reported no issues during pregnancy. However  he was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect at a regular 6-month checkup  which needed no intervention at the time. His pediatrician had been maintaining a close watch on his condition.   Current Medical Condition:  Recently  the child was brought to the clinic due to persistent fatigue and episodes of breathlessness  especially after physical exertions like climbing stairs or playing with friends. A physical examination indicated a cardiac murmur  which initiated further investigations.  Investigations:  An echocardiogram was carried out which confirmed a diagnosis of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)  specifically Atrial Septal Defect (ASD). ASD is a type of CHD  characterized by a hole in the wall between the heart's upper chambers.  Family History:  There is no significant history of any chronic diseases such as diabetes  hypertension  or cardiovascular disease on either side of the family. The family's health record includes some distant relatives with heart disease  but no relatives with congenital heart disease.  Lifestyle:  Mr. X is neither a smoker nor a drinker. He is moderately active but finds it increasingly taxing to continue physical activities due to fatigue and breathlessness. Despite heart disease  he has maintained a healthy BMI.  Discussion:  Mr. X's condition calls for immediate attention due to the high-energy demands of his growing and developing body. A multidisciplinary approach is required  involving a cardiologist  cardiac surgeon  dietician  and psychologist to manage all aspects of his health.  Prognosis and Recommendations:  As the defect is still moderate  surgical intervention may be delayed but not ruled out. Meanwhile  lifestyle modifications should be incorporated  including a balanced diet and regular  moderate exercise. A regular follow-up with the healthcare provider is needed to monitor the progression of the defect.  Conclusion:  With advancements in medical science  the prognosis for individuals diagnosed with ASD type of CHD is positive. Timely intervention and periodic monitoring can assure Mr. X a near normal life. A strong support network in the form of family  friends  and healthcare professionals can significantly contribute to his adjustment to this condition.
13,9,88,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial88,"Patient Information:  The patient  a 3-year-old male of Indian-origin named Sahil  was admitted to the hospital with symptoms like fatigue  unexplained weight loss  cyanosis of the extremities  and frequent episodes of rapid breathing. The date of admission was May 23rd  2023.  Medical History:  Sahil was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot  a variant of congenital heart disease a few days after his birth. His early days were tumultuous and accompanied by 'tet spells' (episodes of deep blue skin  nails  and lips after crying or feeding  or when agitated). Frenquent hospital visits for close monitoring were a part of his medical trajectory.  Sahil also has a recorded history of multiple chest infections owing to the reduced oxygen in the blood. His growth and development have been affected by this condition. No record of allergies is found.  Family History:  Congenital heart diseases in the family can be traced back to uncles from the mother’s side who died in infancy due to unidentified heart diseases. Both parents are in sound health and have no history of heart diseases.   Physical Examination:  On examination  Sahil expressed clubbing of the fingers and was found to be hypoxic. Cyanosis was profound  particularly noticeable on lips and fingertips. A coarse systolic murmur was present on auscultation. His other functions are recorded within normal parameters.  Imaging and Tests:  An echocardiogram revealed ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and over-riding aorta  confirming the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot. The patient also exhibited lowered oxygen levels during pulse oximetry testing. The chest X-ray demonstrated a """"boot-shaped"""" heart  commonly seen in this condition. Other blood work and routine analyses showed no irregularities.  Diagnosis:  Continued symptoms and multiple test results reconfirmed the initial diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot.  Plan:  The attending cardiologist recommended corrective surgery to be the best option for Sahil. Pre-surgical evaluation is presently underway. Additionally  preemptive antibiotics are being administered due to the increased risk of bacterial endocarditis in his condition. The parents have been apprised of the situation completely and are cooperating with the medical team to ensure Sahil faces minimal discomfort.  All medical staff are prepared for immediate intervention should Sahil suffer a 'tet spell.' We are moving ahead with the target of performing corrective surgery when Sahil is medically stable and strong enough to withstand the same. The parents are also taking genetic counseling to understand the risks associated with future pregnancies."
13,9,89,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial89,Patient Profile:  Baby Boy James  10-day-old/neonate  was recently released from the hospital and was brought back due to symptoms of fatigue  rapid breaths  and poor feeding. His mother  a 24-year-old from the Hispanic community  gave birth to him without observing any prenatal issues. This is her first child; the pregnancy was uneventful  and there was no detection of congenital heart disease (CHD) from prenatal ultrasound studies. Baby James was born at 38 weeks via vaginal birth. The family history does not show any cases of heart diseases.  Presenting Problem: The child's symptoms present as cyanosis  rapid breathing  tiredness  poor feeding  and poor weight gain. Based on these observations  the infant was suspected to have a congenital heart disease. After referral to a pediatric cardiologist  an echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)  a form of CHD. The diagnosis was made based on the displaying features of TOF  including ventricular septal defect (VSD)  right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO)  right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)  and an overriding aorta.  Past Medical History: Since the child is only ten days old  there is very limited medical history. Records from the neonatal unit showed that the infant had an Apgar score of 7 at 1 minute  which improved to 8 by 5 minutes. He had an uncomplicated neonatal course aside from some initial feeding difficulties  which was thought to be due to transient tachypnea of the newborn at that time. However  the persistence of symptoms and poor weight gain prompted further investigation.  Family History: The child’s mother is 24 years old and in good health. There's no known family history of heart disease  chromosomal abnormalities  or any other genetic conditions. The child's mother did not use alcohol  smoke  or use any harmful drugs during pregnancy. The father  aged 26  is also in good health.   Diagnostic Tests and Results: Upon admission  Baby James’s physical examination showed a heart rate of 156 beats/min  respiratory rate of 66 breaths/min  blood pressure was 67/45 mm Hg  and SpO2 ( Oxygen Level) was 75%. His weight was found to be below average for his age  which pointed towards 'failure to thrive'. An echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of TOF based on the characteristics mentioned earlier.  Treatment and Recommendations: Due to the serious nature of the condition  surgical intervention has been recommended for Baby James within the first year of life. He has been placed on supportive measures like oxygen therapy  diuretic medication  and high-caloric formula feeds until surgical correction can be done. The family has been advised about the risks and benefits of surgery  and genetic counseling has also been recommended for further understanding of the condition and possible implications for future pregnancies.
13,9,90,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial90,Patient Presentation:  A 6-month-old Caucasian female patient is brought to the pediatric clinic today for a routine checkup. The baby was born full term (39 weeks +3 days) via normal vaginal delivery  without any complications during labor or at birth. Birth weight was 7lbs 2oz.   Past Medical History: The infant has a confirmed diagnosis of congenital heart disease  specifically a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). A postnatal echocardiogram discerned the defect when the baby was only 10 days old after a new heart murmur was identified on her newborn exam. Other than these  no major illnesses  surgeries  or hospitalizations have occurred. Her vaccinations are up to date per the CDC’s immunization schedule.  Family History: The patient has a 4-year-old brother who has no significant health issues. The mother is a 28-year-old healthy woman with no known genetic health problems. However  the father  30 years old  has a history of congenital heart disease in his family. His younger brother had surgery for Tetralogy of Fallot as an infant.  Social History: The young patient resides with her aforementioned immediate family in a suburban area. She has been exclusively breastfed since birth and the mother reports her as being generally good with feeding  despite occasional bouts of fatigue.  Clinical Presentation: The baby presents as generally well on examination. Since the heart defect diagnosis  the infant exhibits some symptoms of heart failure including feeding difficulties  rapid breathing  increased sweating  and poor weight gain.   On physical inspection today  the baby has pallor with cyanotic episodes  particularly during crying. She has a Grade 3 systolic murmur on examination  consistent with a previous exam. Her chest X-Ray shows cardiomegaly and her Echo reveals a large VSD with left to right shunt.  Further Interventions: The patient's case has been reviewed by a Pediatric Cardiologist for further management. Given the size of her VSD and symptoms of congestive heart failure not improving with medication  surgery is being considered as the next step for treatment. Nutritional support is ongoing to address her poor weight gain  with a regime in place to fortify her mother’s breast milk.  Summary: In conclusion  the 6-month-old infant  given her family history and current symptoms  displays the challenges of managing congenital heart disease. This case outlines the importance of early detection and the multidisciplinary team approach in maintaining a high quality of life for children living with congenital heart defects.
13,9,91,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial91,"Patient Presentation  Patient Information:  The patient is a five-month-old male infant  named Jason  of Asian descent  born in Massachusetts USA. His parents have no history of travel outside the country.  Medical History:  Jason was born at full-term (40 weeks)  with a birth weight of 3.6 kg. He was diagnosed with a heart murmur at birth  and echocardiography at that time showed a congenital heart defect—Tetralogy of Fallot. This is inclusive of four defects  namely ventricular septal defect (VSD)  pulmonary stenosis  a right ventricular hypertrophy  and an overriding aorta. Since birth  he has been receiving pediatric cardiovascular care  inclusive of medicines to prevent heart failure and periodic echocardiograms.  Jason's immunizations are up-to-date as per CDC's immunization schedule. Other developmental milestones have been reached as expected for his age. Jason’s recent weight was 6 kg (13.2 lb)  with a length of 60 cm (23.6 in) at his last medical check-up  which falls within acceptable percentiles for his age.  Family History:  There is no family history of congenital heart disease. His mother  aged 30  and his father  aged 32  are both healthy with no noteworthy medical issues. They have no common ancestry  and genetic screening did not reveal any mutations linked with congenital heart disease. Jason is the couple's only child.  Current Status:  At five months  Jason was found to be cyanotic and dyspneic after feedings and these symptoms have been intensifying over the last few weeks. His parents have been noting episodes  post-feeding  where his skin was turning bluish  mainly around his lips and in his extremities indicating the development of “Tet spells"""" so-called because they most commonly present in babies with Tetralogy of Fallot.  Clinical Examination:  On examination  he had a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left mid-sternal border. Echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot. His oxygen saturation was 78% on room air.  Plan:  Given the increasing severity of Jason's symptoms  surgical repair is suggested. The procedure proposes to widen the passage towards the lungs to enhance blood flow and to patch the VSD. A complete cardiac examination  anesthetic investigation  respiratory assessment  genetic evaluation  full blood count  coagulation profile  and a chest radiograph would need to be conducted before the surgery. Genetic counseling is advised for the parents future pregnancies.  This plan has been fully discussed with the parents. They understand the procedure  its benefits  potential risks  and long-term prognosis. They consent to move forward with the intervention.  Discussion:  The patient's presentation is typical for an infant with unrepaired Tetralogy of Fallot. Timely surgical intervention can enhance the child's prospects for a near-normal life. Careful postoperative follow-up is crucial to observe for any complications like arrhythmias  pulmonic stenosis  or regurgitation. The detailed history  physical examination  and diagnostic studies help clinch the diagnosis and guide appropriate management."
13,9,92,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial92,Patient Profile: Name: X (Due to patient confidentiality  the name isn't revealed) Age: 2 Months    Gender: Male    Race: Caucasian  Residency: Toronto  Canada   Access to healthcare: Regular Pediatric Cardiology check-ups are in order   Chief Complaint: Parents brought in an infant presenting symptoms of rapid breathing  excessive sweating  fatigue  and poor feeding.   Medical History: The patient was full term with an uncomplicated neonatal course until 1 week of age when symptoms began. Birth weight was normal. Milestones were being met up until the onset of symptoms. No known allergies. Has been immunized up to date as per infant schedule in Canada.  Family History: Both parents are alive and healthy. No reported case of congenital heart disease in the family nor any history of any other genetic diseases.  Physical Examination: Upon pediatric examination  cyanosis and clubbing were noted. An abnormal heart murmur was detected during the auscultation.   Investigation: Upon further investigation using echocardiography  the baby was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot which is a type of congenital heart defect. The defect comprises four abnormalities including ventricular septal defect (VLD)  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy and an overriding aorta.  Management Plan: A Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgeon was consulted. An initial surgical procedure focused on providing temporary relief through a shunt to improve oxygen-rich blood supply  called a Blalock-Taussig shunt procedure. The infant will undergo a complete repair of the defect through open-heart surgery between 3 to 6 months of age. Based on the baby's current physical state  the benefits were deemed to outweigh the risks.   Genetic counseling was arranged for the parents to discuss the likelihood of future children having the same disease. Nutritional support for the infant has been arranged as well.  Prognosis: The prognosis post-surgery looks positive given the absence of additional complications or infections. Long-term close monitoring and periodical cardiology reviews will be required.   Follow-Up: The family will have regular follow-ups with cardiology both pre and post-operatively. In the meantime  close monitoring of the infant's weight  general activity level  color  and breathing rates are advised.
13,9,93,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial93,Patient Profile: Mr. Adam Smith is a 19-year-old African American male who has recently been diagnosed with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). He hails from Brooklyn  New York  and is currently in his first year of college. He enjoys sports  especially basketball  but has been experiencing severe fatigue and shortness of breath recently  making it difficult for him to engage in any physical activity. Adam lives with his parents and two younger siblings  all of whom are in good health.  Medical History: Adam had been a healthy individual up until his diagnosis of CHD. The only significant medical history was a respiratory infection when he was 7  from which he quickly recovered. There had been no previous history of cardiovascular abnormalities. He had come down with a severe chest infection six months ago  after which he began experiencing his current symptoms.  Family History: Adam's family history does not include any known cardiovascular disorders or sudden deaths. His mother is a 40-year-old woman with Diabetes Mellitus  and his father is a 45-year-old smoking male with no significant health issues. His younger siblings  aged 15 and 12  do not have any known health abnormalities.   Diagnosis: Congenital heart disease was not suspected at the time of Adam's birth  as no typical signs or symptoms were observed then. However  given his recent severe symptoms and after performing Echocardiogram and Electrocardiogram  the cardiologist confirmed the diagnosis of CHD. He has a Ventricular Septal Defect  one of the most common forms of CHD.  Implications: As a result of his Ventricular Septal Defect  Adam has started experiencing symptoms such as breathlessness  fatigue  and rapid heart rate  all of which significantly affect his daily life. Despite the difficult news  Adam is hopeful about the next steps in his treatment plan  which would likely include lifestyle modifications  medications  and in some cases  open-heart surgery. The goal of treatment would be not just to extend Adam's life but also to improve its quality.  Follow-up and Prognosis: Adam’s prognosis will largely depend on how he responds to the treatment plan laid out by his cardiologists and surgeons. Unfortunately  CHD cannot be cured  but many patients with this condition can live productive and satisfying lives with the right treatment and care. The medical team will continue to closely monitor Adam's progress and adjust his treatment as necessary.

Both Mr. and Mrs. Smith are of Anglo-Saxon heritage and have no notable history of congenital heart disease in their familial lineage. However  the father is mildly hypertensive and the mother had gestational diabetes during her pregnancy with Isabella.   Presenting Complaint & Diagnosis:   Isabella was brought to our clinic due to her parents' concerns regarding her difficulty in feeding  shortness of breath  and signs of developmental delay. She was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot  based on echocardiography and cardiac MRI findings.  Clinical History:   Isabella's birth was uncomplicated  but in the first few weeks  she experienced feeding difficulties and episodes of cyanosis  also known as """"blue baby"""" episodes  especially during crying and feeding. Her growth milestones were lagging behind the normal range for her age. Previously  she was diagnosed with a murmur during her two-month wellness check. Subsequent evaluations and tests unfolded the gravity of the problem.  Recent Physical Examination and Investigations:  On physical examination  Isabella weighed 6.2 kg  below the 5th percentile for her age and gender. She displayed dyspnea and cyanosis. Finger clubbing was also observed. Auscultation revealed a loud systolic murmur.   The ECG suggested possible right ventricular hypertrophy. Two-dimensional echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot. Echocardiography showed a large ventricular septal defect  overriding aorta  pulmonary stenosis  and right ventricular hypertrophy. These findings were confirmed by cardiac catheterization and MRI.  Treatment Plan:   Currently  Isabella has been put on beta-blockers for managing her symptoms. A complete intracardiac repair surgery is planned within a month to prevent further complications and improve her quality of life. Counseling sessions have been arranged for the parents for mental support and educating them about post-surgery care.  Follow Up:   Given the nature of her condition  continuous monitoring of Isabella's health is critical. Regular follow-ups  including echocardiograms  stress tests  and heart MRIs  have been scheduled to monitor her recovery and catch any complications promptly post-surgery.  In conclusion  Isabella's case is a prime example of the complexities of congenital heart diseases and the need for early detection and timely intervention to improve patient outcomes.   Involvement of a multidisciplinary team consisting of a pediatric cardiologist  cardiothoracic surgeon  dietitian  physical therapist  psychotherapist  and pediatrician is necessary to holistically address her health needs."
13,9,95,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial95,Patient Identification: The patient is a 6-month-old  Caucasian male named James. He is a first-born child to non-consanguineous parents.  Chief Complaint: Recurrent episodes of poor feeding and excessive sweating noted since 2 months of age.   Past Medical History: Apart from neonatal jaundice  which resolved spontaneously  his past medical history is unremarkable. He received regular immunization in the well-baby clinic.  Family & Social History: There is no family history of congenital heart disease  diabetes  dyslipidemia  or genetic disorders. The mother had a normal pregnancy  and no excessive drug  alcohol  or tobacco use was reported during pregnancy. The father is healthy with no known medical conditions.   Clinical Presentation & Physical Examination: James was brought in by his parents  who expressed concern about his poor feeding  profuse sweating  and rapid breathing particularly during feeds. On physical examination  he weighs 6.8kg (less than the 2nd percentile for age  suggesting failure to thrive). He had a noticeable tachypnea  with a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute  a heart rate of 160 beats per minute  and mild intercostal retractions. Upon auscultation  there was a loud pansystolic murmur heard best in the left lower sternal border.  Investigations: Lab tests were normal except for a slightly elevated BNP. Chest x-rays showed an enlarged heart. An ECHO was done revealing a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) causing a left-to-right shunt and signs of potential congestive heart failure.   Diagnosis: Based on the findings  a diagnosis of Congenital Heart Disease - specifically a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) - was made. The signs of heart failure noted in the ECHO and clinical presentation raise concern for developing congestive heart failure.  Management: The Cardiology team has been consulted. They plan to initiate medical management for heart failure and monitor response. Referral to a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon will be considered if he fails to thrive and continues to show symptoms and signs of heart failure.  Conclusion: James' case illustrates the importance of recognizing early signs of congenital heart disease in infants. Prompt investigation and management can limit the progression of the disease and its complications. Educating parents on the clinical manifestations of the illness will play a crucial role in preventing any unforeseen complications.

13,9,97,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial97,Patient Case Presentation  Demographics:   The patient  let’s refer to him as “John” here  is a 6-month-old male infant who is of Caucasian ethnicity. He was born to a family living in a suburban neighborhood in Ohio. The family has a moderate financial status.  Presenting Problem:  John was brought to the hospital by his parents as they noticed that he was gaining weight slowly  appeared to get tired easily during feedings  and would frequently turn blue especially while crying or feeding. His parents also reported that he was breathing rapidly and showing signs of restlessness.  Past Medical History:  John was delivered normally at term with no complications during the birth process. He was however diagnosed with learning difficulties shortly after birth but has not experienced any significant health problems in the past months. No surgeries  hospitalizations  or major illnesses were reported.  Family History:  On exploring family history  it was discovered that John’s elder sister also had a heart condition (patent ductus arteriosus) which was corrected through surgery when she was a year old. There has been no history of any genetic disorders or recurrent health problems in the family. Both parents are non-smokers and there was no history of substance abuse during or after the pregnancy.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  John appeared to be smaller for his age and had mild cyanosis. The physical examination garnered findings of increased heart rate  a prominent precordial impulse  and distinctive heart murmurs. No abnormalities were found in the other systems on physical examination.  Investigations:  John was subjected to various diagnostic tests which included a chest X-Ray  ECG  and an echocardiogram. His blood tests included complete blood count  coagulation profile  liver function test  and kidney function test. The echocardiogram results revealed that John has Tetralogy of Fallot  a congenital heart defect that is actually a combination of several heart defects present at birth.  Management:  John is currently managed with beta-blockers and digoxin along with high-calorie feeds. He is now scheduled for a surgical correction once his overall health condition improves. Further management will include regular cardiac follow ups.  Learning Points:  This case presentation emphasizes the importance of a keen eye for symptoms  like difficulty in feeding  failure to thrive  and cyanosis  suggesting possible congenital heart disease in infants. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve the prognosis of these patients. This case also underscores the importance of thorough family history collection in diagnosing congenital problems.

The infant has normal tone  power  and reflexes. Clubbing  cyanosis  or dysmorphic features are not present. Auscultation reveals a systolic murmur in the left upper sternal border.  Investigations:  The ECHO showed a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)  confirming the diagnosis of congenital heart disease.  Management and Plan: The infant is referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further evaluation and management  which may include heart surgery or cardiac catheterization for VSD closure based on the size of the defect and the symptoms. The infant will also be monitored for weight gain and development milestones. Follow-up appointments every 1-2 months or as advised by the pediatric cardiologist will be scheduled.   Discussion:  Congenital heart diseases are the most common congenital malformations in newborns  significantly contributing to infant morbidity and mortality. Recognizing symptoms early and referring them for specialized care is of utmost importance. 
13,9,99,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial99,Patient Profile: The patient  J.N.  is a three-month-old Hispanic male infant hailing from a low-income family from Bronx  New York City.  Past Medical History: J.N. was delivered full-term with no significant complications during the mother's pregnancy. The infant began manifesting symptoms two weeks after birth  including rapid breathing  feeding difficulties  and consistent fatigue. At his one-month check-up  the pediatrician noted significant weight loss and recommended further testing.   Family History: The family history reveals no congenital heart disease; however  the mother is a type 2 diabetic. Both parents are non-smokers  and there is no history of recreational drug use. The mother did not consume alcohol during her pregnancy.  Diagnosis and Symptoms: The patient was referred to a pediatric cardiologist after persistent symptoms. The cardiologist carried out multiple tests including an Echocardiogram  Electrocardiogram (EKG) and a chest X-ray. The diagnosis of a congenital heart defect was confirmed  specifically a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). Symptoms consistent with this diagnosis include the inability to gain weight  rapid breathing  increased perspiration  excessive fatigue  light-headedness  and occasionally  a rapid heart rate.   Treatment and Management: Considering the patient's age  open-heart surgery is deemed the best option to patch the hole in the heart. Medication has temporarily been provided to control the symptoms until the child is stable enough for surgery. This includes Digoxin to strengthen the heart muscle and Furosemide  a diuretic designed to remove excess fluid in the body.   Patient Education and Follow-up: The parents have been educated about the severity of J.N.'s condition  the importance of medication adherence  and the associated signs and symptoms of potential complications  including impaired growth and respiratory infections.   The next course of action includes regular follow-ups with the pediatric cardiologist  monitoring the infant's growth  watching for changes in health status  and preparing for corrective surgery. After surgery  J.N. will need ongoing care to monitor his progress and to ensure that his heart is working adequately.  Social Context and Other Pertinent Information: Due to the family’s socio-economic status  financial struggles can pose a significant challenge in providing the necessary care and post-surgical rehabilitation for J.N. Assistance from social workers and case managers will be required to help the family access financial aid and navigate health insurance complexities. Programs like WIC (Women  Infants  and Children) can provide supplemental nutrition to ensure that J.N. receives adequate nutrition to improve his weight gain and overall health status.
13,9,100,diagnosis13-prompt9-trial100,Patient Case Presentation  Introduction   Mr. X is a 21-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CHD)  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot  presenting with cyanosis and shortness of breath. This condition was diagnosed during infancy. His current visit is a follow-up from his most recent surgery that occurred when he was 18  clearing his pulmonary valve obstruction.   Clinical History   Mr. X was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot during infancy owing to symptoms of cyanotic spells and feeding difficulties. His CHD is characterized by four distinct heart defects: ventricular septal defect  pulmonary stenosis  right ventricular hypertrophy  and a malpositioned aorta. Despite facing numerous surgical procedures during his lifetime  delays in optimal treatment have led to the manifestation of chronic symptoms such as fatigue  shortness of breath  and cyanosis  particularly during physical exertion.  Family History   His family history reveals that both his parents are healthy with no cardiovascular abnormalities. However  his paternal aunt had a child with Down's Syndrome  which increases the risk for associated congenital heart defects.   Demographics   The patient is a university graduate and currently unemployed due to ongoing health complications. He lives with his parents in an urban setting. He is a non-smoker and does not use alcohol or illicit substances. The patient is single with no children.  Treatment   Mr. X has undergone a series of cardiac surgeries  with the most recent intervention to clear the pulmonary valve obstruction and repair the ventricular septal defect. He also takes several medications  including cardiac medications (beta-blockers and diuretics)  as part of his ongoing care.  Lifestyle   Given his CHD  Mr. X is advised to limit strenuous physical activity. He used to play football but now only watches it. He enjoys books and music. He follows a heart-healthy diet  low in sodium  and rich in fruits and vegetables.  In Summary   Mr. X's case illustrates the long-term complications faced by individuals with congenital heart disease such as Tetralogy of Fallot. Appropriate medical and surgical management combined with lifestyle modifications are crucial in maintaining a reasonable quality of life. However  there is a recognized need for more extensive research and understanding of adult congenital heart disease as it carries significant social and economic repercussions.  Future Considerations   In future consultations  we need to monitor Mr. X's heart function closely and adjust his medications if required. Increases in shortness of breath  fatigue  or cyanosis should be treated promptly. Emphasis should also be given to his mental health  considering his ongoing health issues and unemployment status. Providing platforms for peer support and psychological aid may assist him to better manage his CHD.
13,10,1,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial1,Patient Information: The patient is a 13-month old Caucasian male brought in by his mother for a routine check-up.  Past Medical History: Antenatally  the patient was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot  which was confirmed at birth. He has had no major illnesses or surgeries to date. The patient's immunization schedule has been followed as per the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines.   Key Complaints: According to the mother  the baby shows signs of dyspnea and a bluish skin color  especially during episodes of increased activity or feeding.  In past months  the mother noticed frequent cyanotic episodes in her son  where his skin turns bluish-purple. He also seems to tire easily  particularly during feedings- often needing to stop to rest before continuing. In general  he does not play as actively as other kids of the same age.   There have been more specific complaints of an episode termed a “Tet spell ” where the baby became very blue  started crying  and became limp. The mother noted increased blueness of lips and skin during these episodes.  While there is no report of poor weight gain  the mother also expressed concerns about her son's slower than usual growth compared to his elder siblings at the same age. The patient appears smaller than other toddlers and has had a somewhat slow growth.   Birth History: The baby was born full term without any complications and had normal Apgar scores. He weighed 3.0 kg at birth. The mother had full antenatal care with no reported complications during pregnancy. She is a non-smoker and reported no alcohol or drug use. The family history is non-contributory  with no known congenital heart disease or genetic disorders reported.  Observations: Physical examination upon arrival revealed central cyanosis and clubbing of fingers. The baby also had a systolic murmur upon auscultation.  The purpose of this case study is to highlight the diagnostic approach and management considerations of Tetralogy of Fallot  a complex congenital heart disease. Clinical manifestations  therapeutic interventions  and prognosis should be discussed in detail to provide medical students with a broad understanding of this medical condition.
13,10,2,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial2,"Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Information:  Name: Baby Jane  Age: 6 months Sex: Female Race/Ethnicity: African-American Insurance: Public Insurance  Past Medical History:  Baby Jane was born full-term without complications. At 48 hours of age  a routine newborn screening displayed abnormalities. Elevated blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) raised suspicion for the presence of a congenital heart defect. An echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). There is no other significant medical history or family history of congenital cardiac anomalies.  Key Complaints:  Baby Jane's mother reports that the baby frequently turns blue  particularly after eating or crying. This is an indication of """"tet spells"""" associated with TOF. She also observed that Baby Jane has difficulty feeding and tires easily. She fails to gain weight or grow at the expected pace. The pediatrician noted a loud murmur during auscultation  pointing to a possible Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) - one of the elements of TOF.  Discussion Points:  1. Ask trainees to explain the pathophysiology behind the """"tet spells"""" observed in the case  2. Discuss healthcare interventions to manage and treat TOF 3. Explore challenges in diagnosing congenital heart disorders in newborns  focusing on the importance of routine screening  echocardiography  and early intervention  4. Discuss long-term management and prognosis of TOF.  5. Discuss genetic factors associated with TOF.  6. Educate about the 4 abnormalities present in Tetralogy of Fallot  7. Discuss the sequelae of untreated TOF 8. Discuss the impacts of TOF on other body systems  particularly the respiratory and circulatory systems."
13,10,3,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial3,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: C.C.  a 9-month-old male infant  Hispanic  born in Texas  USA.   Past Medical History: Full-term normal vaginal delivery with an uncomplicated perinatal course. Postnatal physical examinations were described as generally healthy except the persistent signs of breathlessness and poor feeding. Mother reported no prenatal substance exposure or infections. No significant family history of congenital heart diseases.  Presenting Complaints: Primary caregiver  who is the patient's mother  brought him to the pediatric clinic due to observation of frequent episodes of increased breathing difficulty  poor feeding  and less weight gain compared to other babies of the same age. Mother also reports that the infant has a bluish discoloration around lips especially during episodes of crying.   Pediatrician’s Assessment: Upon physical exam  atypical cardiac sounds are noted as well as subtle cyanosis of oral mucous membranes. Palpating the chest reveals a parasternal heave. There's differential cyanosis with lower extremity saturation at 88% and upper extremity saturation at 98%. Complete blood count and metabolic panel are normal.  This is a theoretical case presentation to educate medical students about the diagnosis and management of congenital heart disease  suspecting Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease  possibly Tetralogy of Fallot given the presence of a parasternal heave and differential cyanosis. Further diagnostic investigation like ECG and echocardiography would be needed for confirmation. It’s critical to recognize these physical examination findings and act promptly to provide necessary interventions and specialist referrals.
13,10,4,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial4,Patient Information: Baby John  a male newborn delivered full-term  via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. Apgar score was 9 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes post birth. The child's birth weight was 3.2 kg and he displayed no signs of distress.   Past Medical History: Mother's pregnancy was uneventful. Routine prenatal screenings and ultrasounds were normal  with no signs of fetal anomalies. The mother is a 26-year-old with no significant medical history. This is her first baby. Neither parent has any significant medical or family history regarding congenital or hereditary illnesses.   Major Complaints: During neonatal nursing care  routine-check-up finds baby John to be slightly cyanotic with oxygen saturation around 85%. On closer examination  John exhibits labored breathing and a murmur can be heard upon auscultation of the heart. Evaluation of his pulse revealed that it was slightly faster than the average rate for his age with lower extremity pulses weaker than the upper ones.  Clinical Concern: The above findings raise suspicion of possible congenital heart disease  which encompasses a broad spectrum of heart abnormalities present at birth  such as tetralogy of Fallot  coarctation of the aorta  or transposition of the great arteries. Further diagnostic tests  such as an echocardiogram and chest X-ray  along with a consultation with a pediatric cardiologist  are advised. 
13,10,5,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial5,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Information:  1. Demographics:     - Age: 6 months old    - Gender: Male    - Ethnicity: Asian    - Location: Urban  2. Past medical history:    - Born full term with no immediate postnatal complications    - Regular immunizations up to date     - No known family history of congenital heart diseases  3. Presenting Symptoms:    - Mother reports the baby is not feeding well and tires easily    - Chronic cough  recurrent respiratory tract infections    - Failure to thrive  observed slow weight gain    - Cyanosis  bluish tint of skin  lips  and fingernails    - An unusual heart sound (murmur) detected during routine physical examination    - Poor physical endurance compared to babies of a similar age  The case above can introduce the complexity of diagnosing congenital heart disease given the nonspecific nature of many of its symptoms  particularly in infants. From the foundation of this case  didactic emphasis can be placed on the importance of systematic examination  awareness of differential diagnoses for the presented symptoms  importance of pediatric echocardiography  and the potential long-term implications for the patient's physical and cognitive development.
13,10,6,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial6,Patient Information:  Name: Baby boy Smith Age: 6 months old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian  Past Medical History: Smith was delivered at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy. He is up-to-date on his immunizations. The mother reported no history of prenatal drug or alcohol exposure and no family history of heart disease was noted.   Key Complaints: The mother brought Baby Smith to the pediatric clinic due to concerns about his slow weight gain and poor feeding. She has noticed that he often becomes sweaty and extremely tired during feeds. Occasionally  she's noticed a bluish tint around his lips and on his fingers especially during crying episodes. In addition  there's been an increase in his respiration rate and she noted some bouts of uncontrollable crying.  Plan: Based on the clinical symptoms  a suspicion of a congenital heart disease has been established. Further investigations including a detailed physical examination  chest X-Ray  an echocardiogram and perhaps a cardiac catheterization will be scheduled to confirm the diagnosis. The case will then focus on the treatment options for the diagnosed heart condition for optimal management of the patient's condition.
13,10,7,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial7,Patient Information:  Patient is a 1-week old Hispanic female  brought in by her mother. Mother is a 32-year-old  gravida 2  para 2 with no history of medical issues. The baby was born via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery  with an Apgar score of 8/9. The mother received prenatal care and all prenatal testing and ultrasounds were normal. No history of alcohol  drug use  or smoking during pregnancy.  Presenting Complaints:  Baby is experiencing difficulty feeding (infrequently  reduced amounts) and there's notable cyanotic episodes  especially during feeding and crying. Mother also reports that baby seems to have a lack of energy and sleeps more than expected.  Medical History:  No medical problems have been identified in the baby so far; however  a murmur was noted during her initial neonatal examination after birth.  Social History:  The family lives in a smoke-free environment. The parents have no history of congenital diseases or heart conditions. No known exposures to environmental toxins. The mother reports having a healthy diet during pregnancy.  Complete a working diagnosis and create a plan of care according to your university teaching protocol. Given the symptoms described  a potential consideration may be a form of congenital heart disease  such as a cyanotic congenital heart defect. A complete clinical evaluation  including ECG  chest X-ray  and echocardiogram  should be conducted to confirm. If confirmed  treatment options like surgery  cardiac catheterizations  medication  or even a combination of these  may be needed. 
13,10,8,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial8,Patient Information:   Patient Initials: B.D.  Age: 2 Months Old Sex: Gender Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: NA   Past Medical History:   • No previous illnesses or surgeries. • All immunizations up-to-date. • Prenatal history: Unremarkable  carried to full term  vaginal delivery without complications  birth weight: 3.3 kg.  Presenting Complaints:  • Parents noticed persistent blue coloration (cyanosis) of the lips and skin. • Showed signs of difficulty in breathing  especially during feeds. • Periods of rapid heartbeat. • Parents reported the baby has not been gaining weight as expected. • Failure of the baby to thrive  appearing to be tired all the time. • Parents have noticed frequent sweating  particularly during feeds or crying or poor weight gain.  Physical Exam Findings:  • On exam  the baby's weight and height are below the 10th percentile for his age. • On auscultation  a heart murmur was noticed. • Oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels are lower than normal range. • Clubbing of the fingers and toes were observed. • An anomaly noted in the chest shape  pectus excavatum/carinatum.    The case is built for medical students to learn about congenital heart disease  with the infant demonstrating typical signs such as cyanosis  breathing difficulties  failure to thrive  poor weight gain  and a heart murmur. The subsequent management and investigations will focus on diagnosing the specific congenital heart condition and delivering appropriate treatment.
13,10,9,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial9,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: A 4-month-old Hispanic female presented to the pediatric cardiac clinic for a scheduled follow-up.   Past Medical History: The infant was diagnosed with congenital heart disease during her 36th week prenatal ultrasound.  Key Complaints: The parents reported that the infant has increasing episodes of rapid breathing and feeding difficulties. She isn't gaining weight as per expected pediatric growth rates. The parents also noticed frequent episodes of cyanosis around her lips and tongue particularly while feeding.  Hence  this 4-month-old infant is presenting with signs and symptoms typically observed in children suffering from congenital heart disease which includes feeding issues  failure to thrive  and episodes of cyanosis (blue tint to lips and tongue  indicating poor oxygenation).   We will now proceed with physical examination and further investigations to rule out specific conditions responsible for her symptoms  such as Ventricular Septal Defects (VSD)  Atrial Septal Defects (ASD)  Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)  or more complex congenital heart disorders.
13,10,10,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial10,CASE REPORT:  Patient Information:  The patient is a 10-month-old Hispanic male  first-born and born full-term  to a 28-year-old mother via normal vaginal delivery without complications. The infant lives with his parents in suburban New York. There are no siblings in the family.  Past Medical History:  The infant received regular well-child check-ups since birth and all immunizations are current. The newborn screening test was normal. Mother reported a normal pregnancy; however  she admitted to minimal prenatal care and mild alcohol consumption during the first trimester. There is no history of chromosomal abnormalities  genetic disorders  or congenital heart disease on either side of the family. The infant has no known allergies and takes no medications.  Key Complaints:  The mother reports that her son tires easily during feedings and appears to breathe rapidly and heavily at times  mostly after eating. She also expressed concern that her child appears less active compared to other children in their social community. She noted that he is gaining weight but not at the pace expected by their pediatrician. There is no record of fever  cough  cold  diarrhea or seizures.  Physical Examination:  Upon examination  the child's weight is below the 5th percentile for the age group. He appears mildly cyanotic  particularly in the lips and fingertips. Breath sounds were normal with no wheezing or crackles. However  a heart murmur was identified. The rest of the physical examination was normal  without any signs of failure to thrive or developmental delay.   Based on initial findings  the patient was suspected to have a congenital heart disease  possibly a shunt defect due to presence of heart murmur and symptoms of poor weight gain  cyanosis  and easy tiring. Appropriate diagnostic tests and specialist consultations were recommended to confirm the diagnosis.
13,10,11,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial11,Patient Info: 3-month-old Caucasian female Infant  Chief Complaint: The mother reports the infant displays frequent signs of difficulty in feeding  faster heart rate  and persistent fatigue. She had also noted the baby seems to sweat a lot  especially during feedings and has poor weight gain.  Past Medical History: The baby was born full-term through natural vaginal delivery. The mother's pregnancy was uneventful with routine antenatal care. The family history is significant for congenital heart disease. No allergies or medications are evident at the time.  Additional Info: Physical examination is remarkable for mild cyanosis  heart murmur  and signs of heart failure such as hepatomegaly. The baby's development is noted to be slower compared to healthy infants of the same age  which may be due to chronic hypoxia.  Diagnostic process and results: Diagnosis is confirmed through a combination of Echocardiogram  showing some structural abnormalities in the heart  and ECG results indicating irregular heart rhythms.   Case Notes: The case emphasizes the early detection of congenital heart disease  underlining the importance of proper prenatal care and recognizing the signs and symptoms in newborns and young infants.
13,10,12,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial12,Case Topic: Congital Heart Disease   Patient Demographics: Name: Baby X Age: 3 months Gender: Male Ethnicity: Asian Birth weight: 3kg  Past Medical History:  Baby X was born at term after a non-complicated  home-birth pregnancy with no known maternal exposure to teratogens. His growth and development parameters at birth were within normal ranges. However  the parents reported that he had been perpetually suffering from poor feeding since birth and wasn't meeting growth milestones satisfactorily. There was no significant family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Key Complaints:  At 3 months  the parents reported an increase in the frequency of episodes where Baby X turns blue  particularly while feeding. The baby also shows signs of difficulty breathing and excessive sweating even during light activities. The parents also noted a failure of the baby to gain weight and grow along the standard growth curve.  On examination  the patient was found cyanotic especially around the lips and fingertips. Upon auscultation  a continuous heart murmur sys/dia was heard in upper left sternal border (grade 3/6). The liver was palpable 2cm below the costal margin.  As the case progresses  we will journey along the differential diagnoses  rank them  and gradually exclude possibilities to arrive at the most probable diagnosis  evaluate the condition  discuss investigations  management  and interventions appropriate for this case of congenital heart disease.
13,10,13,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial13,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Demographics: Name: Alex Johnson Age: 5 years old Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Location: San Diego  California   Past Medical History: Alex was diagnosed with a murmur after birth which led to a further diagnostic test revealing a congenital heart defect. He was surgically corrected a few weeks after birth. There has been no significant illness since then.  Major Complaint(s): Over the last six months  Alex has gradually shown signs of lethargy  poor feeding  and rapid heart rate. Recently  Alex's kindergarten teacher reported him getting easily fatigued during physical activities. His parents have also noted increasing episodes of unusual paleness and shortness of breath during his playtime.  Consultation and Assessment: Upon consultation with a pediatric cardiologist  it was noted that Alex had a typical pulse rate of 110 beats per minute  and lower extremity edema was observed. Alex had an evidently prominent precordial impulse during examination. The practitioner also noted a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border  which hadn't been present in his previous check-ups.  From this clinical scenario  students should suspect that Alex might be experiencing a complication from his earlier congenital heart defect. The elevated pulse rate might be his heart compensating for a defect. The murmur and signs of edema could imply potential heart failure.   This case can guide students to understand the possible long-term effects of congenital heart diseases despite surgical intervention  and the need for thorough long-term monitoring for these patients. Students should learn about different management strategies to handle such cases  available surgical options  medication  and lifestyle modifications that can improve the patient's condition.

Mother had a normal prenatal course with no history of infections  drug use  or other anomalies. No family history of congenital heart disease.  Presenting Complaints: The patient was brought by his mother who reports that he has been displaying certain worrisome behaviors. She noted that he appears bluish  particularly around the lips  when he cries or feeds. Furthermore  she reports that he appears to tire easily when feeding  often falling asleep before he finishes. The infant also seems to perspire a lot and exposure to cold weather seems to exacerbate these symptoms. The mother also reported a decrease in his urine output.  Physical Examination: Upon examination  the child appears listless with peripheral cyanosis. Vital signs: Heart rate-158/min  Respiratory rate-62/min  Temperature-97.6°F  Blood pressure-70/35 mmHg. Oxygen saturation- 88% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a loud single second heart sound (S2) and a continuous """"machinery"""" murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border. There was mild hepatomegaly.  The backstory in this case has been designed in such a way so as to lead the student towards the possibility of congenital heart disease  more specifically a patent ductus arteriosus or another cyanotic congenital condition."

His birth was uneventful  with a natural delivery at term.  Primary Complaint: The major concern brought by the parents arose during a routine follow-up pediatric appointment where a loud  high-pitched murmur was detected using a stethoscope. The baby's growth rate appears to be normal  however  there seems to be a consistent pattern of tiring quickly during feeding. Furthermore  Baby J's mother reported that the baby's skin occasionally develops a bluish hue  primarily during crying episodes  which is worrying his parents.   Additional notes: The baby has undergone routine immunization but has no other significant medical history. There is no familial record of congenital heart disease or any other inherited illnesses.
13,10,19,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial19,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Name: Baby John Doe Age: 2 months Gender: Male Ethnicity: African American Location: Urban environment Socioeconomic Status: Low income  Past Medical History:  Baby John Doe was a full-term infant born via normal vaginal delivery with an uncomplicated prenatal and perinatal course. John’s pediatric records show that all newborn screening tests were negative  and mandatory vaccinations are up-to-date. His parents’ medical history is unremarkable with no history of congenital diseases. There is no history of early infant death  neonatal illness  or congenital abnormalities in the family.  Key Complaints:  John's parents brought him to their pediatrician out of concern for his lack of weight gain over the last month. They also expressed concern about his excessive irritability  and he appears to sweat excessively especially during feedings  when compared to his older brother at the same age. Over the last week  he seems to have developed a mild cough  showing slight discomfort while breathing which has been worsening gradually. The parents noted a bluish discoloration around his lips and noted it seems more evident when he cries.  This case introduces the students to clinical features associated with congenital heart disease  specifically focusing on symptoms like inadequate weight gain  cyanosis  dyspnea  lethargy  and excessive irritability being common manifestations of the disease in infants. The case further allows for analysis and deep learning regarding the evaluation  diagnosis  and management of congenital heart disease.
13,10,20,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial20,Patient Profile:   Name: Jane Doe Age: 8 months Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian  Past Medical History:  Jane was born full-term after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Her pediatric evaluations have been normal up until now  except for a failure to thrive  poor feeding  excessive sweating and noticeable faster breathing patterns during feeding time.  Chief Complaints:   Jane's parents have brought her to the pediatrician expressing concerns about her poor weight gain and feeding issues. They also report that she seems to become short of breath and excessively sweaty during feedings. Jane's mother also mentioned that she has noticed her daughter's skin has a bluish tinge  especially around her lips and fingertips.   Clinical Suspicion:  Considering patient's age  symptoms and observations  there is a suspicion for congenital heart disease  possibly a form of cyanotic congenital heart defects. Appropriate diagnostic procedures need to be performed to identify the exact nature of the disease. Examination  echocardiography  and further tests should be organized based on these findings. Promoting a healthy lifestyle and providing parental education about the disease will also be significant apart of the management plan.
13,10,21,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial21,Patient Profile: Name: Emily Harris Age: 6 months old Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian  Case Report:  Emily Harris  a 6-month-old Caucasian female  was brought into the clinic by her parents. They have been worried about her  as she has had recurring respiratory infections and has not been gaining weight or growing as expected. Despite feeding regularly  her parents have noticed that she often seems fatigued. Besides  they noticed an unusual bluish tone to her lips and skin  especially when crying or feeding.   Emily was born full-term with no known complications. Her prenatal screenings and newborn assessment were normal. Vaccinations are up-to-date. She is exclusively breastfed. She has two older siblings  both healthy with no significant medical history. Family history does not reveal any known congenital heart diseases or genetic disorders. Her parents deny any exposure to smoking  alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy. They also report no significant environmental exposures or recent travels.  On physical examination  Emily presents with a low weight for her age group  which is in the 3rd percentile. When crying  a noticeable bluish coloration around her mouth and in her fingernails was observed. Examination of the chest revealed a loud heart murmur. The child also showed signs of discomfort and fatigue after the physical examination  requiring breaks to breathe.   The heart murmur and clinical signs are indicative of a possible congenital heart defect  which would need to be confirmed with further testing. The patient's difficulty in gaining weight  persistent respiratory infections and cyanosis contributed to the decision to request a detailed cardiac consultation and echocardiogram.   This case provides a base for learning about congenital heart disease  it showcases typical symptoms and highlights the importance of caregivers' insight and close examination in identifying signs of a possible underlying condition.   After studying this case  medical students should be able to identify some signs and symptoms of pediatric congenital heart disease  understand possible underlying causes  study the relevant diagnostics  and explore the array of potential surgical and non-surgical treatments.
13,10,22,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial22,Patient Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Demographics: Patient: Male Age: 3 months old Ethnicity: Caucasian Waiver: Informed consent obtained from parents for case use in educational context  Past Medical History: The baby was full-term with normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. The perinatal period was uneventful. There is no family history of congenital heart diseases. There is no known exposure to any teratogens during pregnancy. Baby has been exclusively breastfeeding since birth  with no failure to thrive or delayed milestones up to 3 months of age.  Key Complaints: The parents reported increase in rapid breathing and difficulty in feeding for the past week. The baby also appeared to have less energy than usual (not as active or alert) and they noticed circumoral cyanosis (blue coloring around the mouth) especially during moments of crying. The parents stated that over the past week  the feeding process had become increasingly burdensome  often taking over an hour  with the baby needing frequent breaks to catch breath.  Based on the case report provided  medical students are expected to determine the most likely diagnoses  necessary diagnostic tests to confirm this  and potential treatment plans. Emphasis on prompt recognition of congenital heart disease symptoms should be highlighted as it could be life-threatening if not adequately managed. This case encourages students to consider critical diagnosis even in the healthy-looking child with subtle undiagnosed congenital heart disease.
13,10,23,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial23,Patient Presentation:   Patient Initials: B.G   Age: 6 months   Sex: Male   Ethnicity: Caucasian   Background:  The patient B.G is a 6-month-old Caucasian male who was brought into our pediatric outpatient clinic by his mother. B.G is a firstborn child and was delivered at full term with no reported complications during pregnancy or childbirth.   Past Medical History: B.G’s mother reports no significant prenatal or postnatal conditions affecting the child. B.G has had regular pediatric follow-up since birth  including all recommended vaccinations and screenings. He has had no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. No known drug allergies reported.   Key Complaints: The patient was brought in by his mother due to concerns about her son's feeding problems and the frequent respiratory infections he's had since birth. She mentioned that he tires easily during breastfeeding  sweats excessively  and has a poor weight gain in comparison to the growth charts. She also noted a noticeable bluish discoloration on her son's lips and skin  especially during those feeding times. The patient’s mother has no family history of congenital heart disease but reports that her maternal uncle had a 'hole in the heart' but is unsure regarding details.  Physical Examination: On examination  B.G was slightly tachypneic and had mild cyanosis in the lips. Upon auscultation  there was a loud systolic ejection murmur appreciated best in the left upper sternal border  consistent with heart disease.   The purpose of this case study is to explore the potential diagnosis of a congenital heart defect (potentially a type of cyanotic congenital heart disease  given the blueish hue of the skin) and to discuss appropriate evaluation and management methods.  Further studies  including echocardiogramm and blood tests  will be needed to definitively diagnose the specific type of heart condition and to form an appropriate care plan. This case provides valuable insights into early symptoms and detection of congenital heart disease. 
13,10,24,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial24,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Demographics:  A 3-month old Hispanic male infant  born full-term with an uneventful prenatal course. The patient resides in an urban setting with his parents and five-year-old sibling. His parents are nonsmokers and have no known drug allergies.   Past Medical History: The infant has been generally healthy since birth. Regular pediatric visits have been maintained with immunizations up to date. The patient has no known prior hospitalizations  no allergies  and no current medication. Family history is notable for a paternal uncle who had an unspecified heart condition in infancy.  Presenting Complaints: The patient originally presented to his primary care provider with parental concerns of poor feeding  increased irritability  and perceived slower weight gain over the last four weeks. The parents have also noticed the baby becoming bluish  especially during feedings.   Physical Examination: On exam  the infant is noted to have mild cyanosis particularly around the oral cavity. On auscultation  there is a loud harsh holosystolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. The liver is palpable 2cm below the right costal margin. The infant’s pulses are full and equal in all four extremities.  Given the baby's age  familial history and current symptoms  it is vital to conduct necessary tests to evaluate congenital heart disease. The increased irritability and bluish color during feeding could suggest cyanotic heart disease. The next step should also include an echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis and detailed evaluation of the heart function and structure. A consult with a pediatric cardiologist will be necessary for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan  which could range from medication management to possible surgical intervention.   The learning objectives of this case are to understand the typical clinical presentation of congenital heart disease in infants  develop a strong approach to evaluation and diagnosis and initiate appropriate referrals and management in a primary care setting.   
13,10,25,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial25,Patient Information:    - Name: Jonathan Doe    - Age: 3-month-old    - Gender: Male    - Ethnicity: African American    - Birthplace: Denver  Colorado    - Presenting location: Denver General Hospital  Colorado  Past Medical History: Jonathan is a 3-month-old African American male  born full term without any complications during pregnancy or delivery. He is up-to-date on his immunizations. The parents are non-consanguineous and there is no family history of congenital heart diseases or early cardiac deaths. Jonathan has adequate growth and weight gain but is fussier and less active compared to his older sister at his age.  Key Complaints: During a well-child check  Jonathan's parents express concerns about him tiring easily when feeding  thus resulting in him having to feed more often. They also report that sometimes he appears sweaty  particularly around his head  and becomes breathless easily when crying or fussing. He has frequent chest infections and does not gain weight at a normal rate  which are both unusual for his age.  Physical Examination: On examination  vital signs show tachycardia and tachypnea. There is a mild cyanosis observed around the lips. A parasternal heave is noted on cardiac examination  with a palpable thrill. On auscultation  there is a pansystolic murmur which is loudest at the left sternal edge.  These complaints and findings suggest the student should consider congenital heart disease in their differential diagnosis. The presence of heart murmur  reduced feeding  sweating  and poor weight gain  would make conditions like Ventricular Septal Defect a high possibility. Further investigations like an echocardiogram would be useful in confirming this.  Educational Goals: - Understand how to identify symptoms and signs of congenital heart disease in infants. - Learn how to perform and interpret a detailed cardiovascular examination in a pediatric patient. - Appreciate the implications of symptoms like failure to thrive  frequent chest infections  and poor feeding in infants. - Learn how to counsel parents and discuss potential diagnoses and next steps. - Understand the role of investigations like echocardiogram in diagnosing congenital heart disease.

Parents are well and the baby was delivered at term with no complications. The pregnancy was uneventful.  Past Medical History: Jack had normal developmental milestones up until 4 months of age. His growth has been slowing since the last two months  and he exhibits signs of poor weight gain. He started showing signs of feeding difficulties  tiring easily during feeds  and the frequency of feeding is reduced.  Key Complaints: The mother has noticed that Jack has been revisiting the hospital repeatedly for recurrent chest infections  which are not fully resolving despite a full course of antibiotics each time. She also reports that Jack sweats excessively  especially during feeds  and tires easily even with minimal exertion. She further mentions that Jack's lips and nails occasionally turn blue  particularly during crying episodes.  Additionally  the mother also noted increased swelling in Jack's lower limbs. The baby’s difficulty in breathing is becoming increasingly noticeable  which is causing distress to the parents. She also mentions a few fainting episodes and rushes Jack to the emergency department fearing a serious health issue.  [This clinical case scenario can further be elaborated upon  depending upon the need of the lesson. The given history points towards the symptoms of a congenital heart disease in Jack.]
13,10,28,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial28,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease (CHD)  Patient Demographics: Baby boy M.B  6-months-old  African-American  born in Maryland  to healthy parents with no known congenital illnesses in the family.  Past Medical History:   The baby was born at full term with a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. No complications were noted during mother's pregnancy. His birth weight was 3200 grams and he had Apgar scores of 8 at 1 minute  9 at 5 minutes. His neonatal period had been uneventful without any reported feeding difficulties  nor failure to thrive.  Key complaints:  Over the past month  his parents have noticed that he gets tired easily  particularly during feeding  which has led to poor weight gain. M.B.'s lips often become blue especially when he is crying or feeding  and he has been experiencing recurrent chest congestion and cough  which don't seem to get better despite the use of common cold remedies.  They have also noticed that his heart beats too rapidly even while simply lying down. There was no history of observed seizures  developmental delay or other major illnesses. There is no family history of similar illnesses or premature sudden deaths. There are no other siblings in the family. Mother denies any noticeable illness during her antenatal period or any major illnesses in the family.   This case aims to address the recognition of symptoms related to congenital heart diseases in the pediatric patient.

(Disclaimer: This is a fictional case created for educational purpose).
13,10,29,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial29,Patient Demographics: Patient Name: Baby E Age: 6 months Sex: Female Residential Area: Suburban Ethnicity: Asian-American   Past Medical History: E was born full term with no complications and has been developing normally. The patient comes from a non-consanguineous family. There is no relevant family history of congenital heart disease or any other genetic disorders.  Key Complaints: Over the last few weeks  E’s mother has noted that E often is fatigued and becomes short of breath more quickly during feeding than she previously did. The pediatrician also mentioned that E’s growth rate has started to slow more than expected around her six-month mark. The mother also reports that E often sweats abundantly even in room temperature.   Note:   The above case report hints at symptoms that may be consistent with a presentation of congenital heart disease such as decreased feeding  failure to thrive  diaphoresis (excessive sweating). Thus  it is important for medical students during their review of this case to carefully consider the differential diagnosis and plan the necessary diagnostic workup for such a presentation. This should likely include further cardiac evaluation due to suspected congenital heart disease.
13,10,30,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial30,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease   Patient Demographics: Patient XYZ is a 3-month-old male infant born to 32-year-old  first-time parents. He was full-term and delivered via Caesarean-section due to breech presentation. The infant is being primarily breastfed  with bottle feeding introduced recently.  Family History: There are no known incidences of congenital heart diseases or other significant genetic conditions within the immediate or extended family. Patient's father has allergic asthma and mother has a history of hypothyroidism.  Past Medical History: Baby XYZ presented with neonatal jaundice soon after birth  resolved completely within a week of photo-therapy. His 6 weeks well-baby checkup was unremarkable  and he has received vaccinations according to recommended schedule. There is no known history of recent fever  cold  or other illnesses.  Key Complaints: At a routine 3 months well-baby visit  the primary caretaker mentioned that the infant seems less active than peers and experiences rapid breathing after feeding. Additionally  the mother expressed concerns that the infant has poor weight gain despite regular feedings  often around 8-10 times in 24 hours. She also noticed that baby XYZ sometimes sweats excessively during a feed  somewhat unusual for an infant.   This case is designed to challenge medical students' ability to identify the signs and symptoms of congenital heart disease in infancy. They should be guided to consider pertinent physical examination including cardiorespiratory status and focus on early diagnostics  possible contributing factors and relevant management options.
13,10,31,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial31,Case Study: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Information:   Name: Baby John Sex: Male  Age: 6 months Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting Complaints:  Baby John has been brought into the pediatric outpatient department by his parents who have noticed he tires easily  especially during feeding. They also report their baby seems to get more breathless compared to other babies  has poor weight gain  and tends to sweat more  particularly around the forehead. The parents deny fever or cough.  Past Medical History:  Antenatal history from the mother reveals that she had regular ante-natal check-ups. She had no history of infections  drug intake  alcohol consumption or radiation exposure during pregnancy. She is a primipara and John was born through a full term normal vaginal delivery without any neonatal complications.  There is no significant family history of congenital heart diseases.  Clinical Examination:  On physical examination  Baby John appears to be tachypneic (fast breathing) at rest and cyanosis (a blueish color in the skin) can be observed around the lips and nails. He is underweight for his age. Auscultation of the chest shows a loud 'pansystolic' murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. His pulses are bounding and there's a prominent liver.  Possible Diagnosis:  Given the clinical features and findings on physical examinations  Baby John is suspected to have a congenital heart disease  more specifically Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). This is characterized by a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart causing oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to mix.  The next steps should include a thorough cardiovascular examination  a chest X-ray  electrocardiogram (ECG)  and an echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis.  Note for Students:  Congenital Heart Diseases like VSD  although may not immediately manifest symptoms at birth  can present with signs like poor feeding  slow weight gain  tachypnea  and excessive sweating in infancy. An early diagnosis can significantly impact the outcomes and reduce the risk of complications. 
13,10,32,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial32,Case Report: Pediatric Patient with Congentital Heart Disease  Patient Demographics: Gender: Female Age: 6-months old Ethnicity: Caucasian Residence: Urban  Past Medical History: The patient was born at full term via normal vaginal delivery. Birth weight was 3.5kg. Antenatal scan did not reveal any abnormalities. Both parents are non-smokers and have done regular antenatal checks. Family history is unremarkable  with no history of congenital heart diseases.   During infancy  the patient had a few episodes of common cold but recovered without any issues. There is no history of hospitalization. All regular check-ups and vaccinations were performed on schedule without any anomalies.   Key Complaints: The mother brought the child to the pediatrician complaining of the child not gaining weight. The mother also reported that the baby seemed to tire easily while feeding and was often breathless during these times. The baby was also reported to sweat excessively particularly during feeds.   On examination  the pediatrician noticed the infant looked pale and had cyanosis of the lips. Auscultation revealed a loud  harsh holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border  which prompted a referral to a pediatric cardiology specialist.   This case is consistent with the potential diagnosis of a congenital heart disease - specifically  ventricular septal defect (VSD). The medical students should be able to differentiate between different types of congenital heart diseases based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination.
13,10,33,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial33,Patient Information:   Name: Baby Mason Age: 3 months  Sex: Male Race: White Birth Weight: 3.2 kilograms Address: 123 James Street  Travelers Rest  South Carolina.  Past Medical History:   Mason was born full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery with an uncomplicated prenatal and perinatal course. His mother reported a healthy pregnancy with mild gestational diabetes controlled through diet. Both parents have no history of heart disease. His early neonatal period was uneventful.  Key Complaints:   Mason presented at his three-month pediatric appointment. His mother reported that he has been experiencing fatigue and poor feeding. She has also noticed rapid breathing and mild cyanosis (bluish or purplish discoloration of skin) during feeding. He gains weight slower than his age-matched peers. During the physical examination  a mid-systolic murmur was noticed.  These signs and symptoms suggest a possible case of congenital heart disease. Further diagnostic evaluations should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Pediatric cardiology consultation is advisable.
13,10,34,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial34,Patient Case Report:  Demographics: Patient: A 6-month-old male infant Parents: Healthy and non-consanguineous. Sibling(s): One older sister  3 years old  without apparent illness. Resident: New York  NY  Past Medical History: The individual was born at term following an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. There was no known exposure to illness  drugs  or toxins during pregnancy. The neonate had a normal examination until the second month  where the parents observed a slow growth pattern compared to his older sister at the same age. The newborn also seemed to feed more slowly and became tired more quickly than expected. No hospitalizations  allergies  or significant illnesses dating back to birth.  Chief Complaints: For the past four weeks  he has shown signs of poor weight gain and the parents have commented on an observed increase in sweating  even at times of rest. On closer questioning  they also noticed that the child seemed to be breathing rapidly and struggled during breastfeeding  needing many breaks to catch his breath. Parental concerns increased due to the persistent bluish discoloration of lips and nail beds of the infant.   This case challenges learners to consider congenital heart disease as a possible cause of the infant’s symptoms. The cyanosis suggests a cyanotic heart defect and the signs of feeding difficulties and poor weight gain can be early signs of congestive heart failure.
13,10,35,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial35,Patient Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Patient X is an 18-month-old male weighing 12kg. He is of Asian ethnicity and his parents are non-smokers with no known genetic predisposition or family history of congenital heart disease. He was born full-term and there were no complications during delivery.  Past Medical History: Since birth  the patient has suffered from recurrent respiratory infections that required several hospitalizations. He has experienced feeding difficulties which resulted in poor weight gain and delayed growth. He was previously diagnosed with failure to thrive and is being followed up regularly by a pediatrician.  Key Complaints: The parents have brought the child to the emergency department due to a high-grade fever that has lasted for two days. On the trip to the hospital  they also noticed an increased rate of breathing and increased fatigue  particularly visible during feeding. The child has been less active and has demonstrated signs of irritability. The parents also mention that the child's feeding habits have worsened since the onset of fever and he has had decreased oral intake.  Possible Diagnosis & Investigations:  The clinical signs and symptoms point toward a potential cardiac problem  possibly congenital heart disease. To confirm the diagnosis  investigations like a Chest X-Ray  Electrocardiogram (ECG)  and echocardiogram should be considered. Further consultation with a pediatric cardiologist is recommended for evaluation and management of the case.   Objective:  The medical students will need to understand the range of clinical presentations of congenital heart disease  its possible impact on patients' feeding habits  and growth patterns. They will also need to learn how to recommend appropriate investigations and referrals  establish a definitive diagnosis  and develop a treatment plan.

Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful  with normal prenatal screenings. He received routine vaccinations. Since birth  mother reports Daniel has not been gaining weight as expected.  Key Complaints:  The parents indicate that Daniel becomes dyspneic and tires easily during breastfeeding. They also report frequent episodes of unexplained restlessness and excessive sweating  especially during feeding time. Daniel's mother noticed that his color seems a bit bluish at times  particularly around the mouth and fingertips. Daniel’s growth has been stagnating for the last 2 months  he has not gained any significant weight.   Family History:   No known genetic abnormalities or diagnosed cases of congenital heart defects in the family. Mother had a virus (unspecified) during the first trimester of pregnancy but recovered without noted complications.  Social History:   Daniel lives in a smoke-free home with both his parents. He has a 3-year-old brother who is in good health. His family has a history of hypertension on the paternal side.   Given these details  the case should stimulate a discussion about Daniel's symptoms  his growth patterns  his family’s medical history  and how these may relate to the differential diagnosis of a congenital heart disease such as Tetralogy of Fallot or ventricular septal defect. Students should be guided to consider potential investigations  treatment plans  and Daniel's long-term management.
13,10,37,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial37,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Demographics: Patient ID: ABC1234 Age: 3-month-old Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian  Past Medical History: The patient was born full term with an uncomplicated prenatal and delivery history. She was noted to be cyanotic and tachypneic shortly after birth and was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for further evaluation. The mother's prenatal record was unremarkable  with normal screening tests. No known maternal diabetes  substance abuse  or medication intake during pregnancy. No family history of congenital heart disease. The patient's elder sister is healthy.   Key Complaints: The patient's mother brought her in for a regular checkup. She noted that the baby has difficulty feeding and often sweats  especially during feeds. She also mentioned that the baby has been increasingly irritable and has not been gaining weight. In addition to this  she also found the baby's lips and skin to be more bluish than usual over the last two days.  Future case discussions based on this scenario can delve into the process of diagnosing the congenital heart disease (possible Tetralogy of Fallot due to symptoms)  interpreting necessary tests  and developing a management plan. It should be a comprehensive exploration of congenital heart diseases in infants.
13,10,38,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial38,Patient Profile: Demographics: 6-month-old Caucasian male named Aaron  Case: Aaron's parents brought him to the pediatrician's office due to lessened physical activity compared to other children his age. According to the parents  Aaron's growth is slower and he gets fatigued quickly even during feeding. They also noticed that he often sweats and breathes heavily  especially during feeding times.  Past Medical History: Aaron's mother had a normal pregnancy without any known exposure to risk factors for congenital heart disease. There are no known familial heart diseases on either side of the family. Vaccinations are up-to-date.  Key Complaints: 1. Decreased physical activity 2. Fatigue  especially during feedings 3. Excessive sweating and heavy breathing during feeding times 4. Slower growth compared to his peers  Physical Exam: On physical examination  the pediatrician noted cyanosis  particularly on the extremities. There is also palpable hepatomegaly. On cardiac auscultation  a heart murmur was detected  prompting further investigations.  These key complaints often act as a red flag for a possible congenital heart disease like Tetralogy of Fallot or other similar disorders. Further investigations like echocardiography  cardiac MRI  or EKG could be performed to confirm the diagnosis  followed by appropriate management.  Learning Objectives:  1. Understand the symptoms and signs of congenital heart diseases such as Tetralogy of Fallot.  2. Understand the diagnostic methods used in the evaluation of congenital heart diseases. 3. Recognize the importance of early detection and management of congenital heart diseases.  4. Know the possible long term effects and prognosis of untreated congenic heart diseases.
13,10,39,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial39,Patient Case:  Patient Demographics: Patient Name: Newborn Male (John Doe) Age: 10-days old Race: African-American State: Utah  Past Medical History: Our patient  John Doe  is a newborn male child with no prior medical history. He was the second child of non-consanguineous parents and was born via normal vaginal delivery at 38 weeks of gestation following an uncomplicated pregnancy. Birth weight was 3100 gm which was appropriate for gestational age. There was no significant family history of heart disease or any related conditions.  Key Complaints: John's mother reported that he had rapid breathing and poor feeding; there were no cyanotic spells. Key physical findings include  but not limited to  a low grade systolic ejection murmur detected during routine neonatal examination.  Objective: The objective of this training case is to familiarize students with the early signs of congenital heart disease  particularly Tetralogy of Fallot. There should be a focus on understanding the diagnostic tools and performing differential diagnosis based on the patient symptoms  i.e. rapid breathing  poor feeding  and heart murmur. They will need to consider important factors such as the patient's age  family medical history  and use various investigative tools (echocardiography  chest X-ray) to confirm the diagnosis. The second part of the case will engage students to discuss the best available management for the newborn child which may include  but not limited to prostaglandin E1 infusion  surgical intervention  and long-term follow-up assessment.  ***(This case may be extended to include various other factors such as genetic analysis  prognosis  etc. depending on the complexity you desire.)
13,10,40,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial40,Patient Description: A two-week-old  Male Caucasian Infant   Past Medical History: The patient was born at 39 weeks via uncomplicated vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 3.5 kilograms. The pregnancy was full term and without significant complications  with normal antenatal scans. The mother is a 28-year-old non-smoker with no incidence of alcohol or drug use during pregnancy. No history of congenital heart disease or other genetic diseases in the family. The infant received routine newborn care and screenings  with normal initial findings.   Key Complaints: The mother has noticed the infant appears slightly blue  especially around the lips. She also noticed that the baby's rate of breathing seems faster than usual  and he has difficulty feeding  often sweating during meals. The mother reports that the baby isn't gaining much weight and sometimes seems unusually tired.  Potential Congenital Heart Disease Suspected: Based on the symptoms presented  a congenital heart defect such as Tetralogy of Fallot  Transposition of Great Arteries  or Ventricular septal defect should be considered.  It would be necessary to instruct the medical students to perform a thorough examination  consider the appropriate diagnoses  and manage the subsequent steps of treatment and care  discussing why they think their diagnosis is correct. Students will also question the patient's mother to gain more information and execute appropriate tests  such as Echocardiogram and Pulse Oximetry  to confirm their diagnosis.
13,10,41,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial41,"Patient Demographics: -Name: Simulated Patient (SP)  -Age: 8 months old  -Gender: Female  -Race: Caucasian -Geographic Origin: Midwest  USA -Socioeconomic Status: Middle class  insured   Past Medical History: The SP is a full-term infant with no known allergies who had an uncomplicated prenatal course. Birth weight was 3.4 kg. She was vaccinated as per the standard immunization schedule. No known family history of congenital defects or medical issues. The SP has no previous hospitalizations or health issues  and she was initially developing typical motor  social  and language skills for her age.   Eating habits: Mother reported an initial weight loss due to initial breastfeeding problems  but a subsequent switch to formula resulted in weight gain. Recently  she's been feeding less and there's been noticeable slowing in weight gain.  Key Complaints:  1) Difficulty in eating: The infant tiring quickly during feeds which leads to intake of small quantities. Mother has also observed a tendency to sweat excessively during and after feedings. 2) Shortness of breath: The infant exhibits frequent periods of rapid  shallow  and labored breathing. 3) Lesser activity and lethargy: The infant has displayed decreased activity and seems fatigued with minimal exertion. 4) Persistent chest cold  cough  and wheezing. 5) Mom reports that the baby gets pale and sometimes turns blue around her lips and mouth after crying or feeding.     Educational Objectives: The learner should recognize these common but vague early infant complaints (tiring with feeding  fewer wet diapers  slower weight gain  and progressively worsening respiratory symptoms) as common signs and symptoms of pediatric cardiac disease. The learner should consider """"congenital heart disease"""" in the differential and be aware that cardiac disease often manifests as failure to thrive in infancy. They should subsequently request an appropriate evaluation to diagnose and manage the underlying issue."
13,10,42,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial42,Patient Case:   Patient Demographics:  The patient in question is a male newborn baby (Jason) of Caucasian descent who was born two days ago in a local hospital.   Past Medical History:  This is Jason's first encounter with medical professionals for a condition such as this. His mother had a healthy pregnancy  and prenatal screenings were normal. No significant medical history is present on the maternal side. There was  however  mention of paternal uncle having unspecified heart problems as an infant.  Key Complaints:  Today  while performing a routine checkup  the hospital pediatrician noticed that Jason exhibits noticeable cyanosis and difficulty feeding. The physician also noted a significant heart murmur during the auscultation. There were also signs of shortness of breath and higher heart rates  indicating probable distress.  In this scenario  Jason presents classic signs of heart complications  more specifically  a possibility of congenital heart disease. The scenario dynamically shifts the focus towards differential diagnosis  selecting appropriate diagnostic tests  interpreting results  and planning treatment.
13,10,43,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial43,Patient Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Demographics: - Name: Laura Johnson - Age: 6 weeks old - Gender: Female - Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic - Parents: Both healthy  non-smokers   Past Medical History: Laura was delivered at full term with no complications. The prenatal period was closely monitored and did not present any abnormal findings. Both parents have no history of congenital heart disease or any other significant medical conditions. Her immunization is up to date and she has no known allergies.  Key Complaints:  Laura's mother has noticed her infant has been experiencing consistent sweating  particularly during feeds over the past two weeks. There have been instances where Laura has gone a little blue around her lips and fingertips after crying or feeding. The mother also reported that Laura seems very tired all the time  and has slower weight gain compared to other kids her age. Additionally  there have been instances where the baby has rapid breathing and poor feeding.   In this scenario  the symptoms described by Laura's mother hint towards potential congenital heart disease. The case would now lend itself to discussions about the next steps in her evaluation  which would most likely include a comprehensive physical examination  an electrocardiogram (ECG)  and possibly an echocardiogram for diagnosis. The differential diagnosis should be narrowed down to specific forms of congenital heart disease such as Tetralogy of Fallot  transposition of the great arteries  and much more which the trainees should be able to identify. The treatment options  prognosis  and management of the patient's condition should also be explored. 
13,10,44,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial44,Patient Profile: Name: John Doe Age: Six months   Gender: Male   Race: Caucasian   Insurance: Private  Past Medical History: John Doe is a six-month-old patient referred from his pediatrician's office. He was born at term without any complications. However  post-birth  he was found to be cyanotic and mildly hypoxic.

13,10,47,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial47,Patient Case Report  Patient Information: Patient's initials: J.D.  Sex: Male  Age: 3 months old  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Location: United States  Past Medical History: J.D. was born full term and appeared healthy at birth  with no significant complications reported during pregnancy or delivery. No notable family history of genetic disorders. Recently  the patient has shown poor feeding  slower weight gain  and increased fatigability compared to infants of similar age.  Key Complaints: Over the last two weeks  J.D.'s mother has observed episodes of rapid breathing and sweating during bottle feeds. She mentioned that he becomes irritable and appears to be progressively paler with a bluish tint around his lips on certain occasions  specifically upon crying.  Objective Data: Physical Examination reveals a slightly lower heart rate than expected for his age with a notable murmur  a bluish color around the lips (cyanosis)  and marginally reduced oxygen saturation level (SpO2 - 88%).  Discussion: This pediatric case is designed to facilitate a discussion about cyanotic congenital heart diseases  mainly focusing on Tetralogy of Fallot  a condition characterized by a combination of four heart defects present at birth. The key signs being episodes of cyanosis  history of poor feeding  and a heart murmur. It allows students to understand the pathophysiology  diagnostic approach  and management of such patients  as well as the importance of early detection of congenital heart defects.
13,10,48,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial48,Patient Demographic Information: - Name: Confidential (Case ID C005) - Age: Three months - Sex: Male - Race: African American - Socioeconomic Status: Low income family (Parents uninsured)  Past Medical History: The patient was born full term with no complications during delivery. The mother had regular prenatal care and no history of drug or alcohol abuse during pregnancy.  Key Complaints: The patient's parents have noticed that he has been breathing heavier than usual since birth. They also report poor weight gain and excessive sleepiness  and the baby appears bluish  more so during feedings. The baby also tires quickly during feedings and seems to be experiencing feeding difficulties.  Based on these concerns  a general pediatrician referred them to a pediatric cardiologist due to the suspicion of a possible congenital heart disorder.   Physical Examination Findings:  On examination  the baby appears cyanotic  especially on the lips and around the oral cavity. He is mildly dyspneic. The pediatrician notes a heart murmur upon auscultation. There's poor peripheral perfusion and an initial assessment shows low oxygen saturation.  Suspected Diagnosis: The clinical presentation suggests cyanotic congenital heart disease  such as Tetralogy of Fallot or Transposition of Great Arteries. The high index of suspicion for a congenital heart disease necessitates further evaluations including Echocardiogram  Pulse oximetry  Chest X-ray  and possibly Cardiac Catheterization.   Prognosis of such conditions vary widely based on the exact diagnosis  availability  and timing of surgical intervention  and the overall health of the patient. This case offers an opportunity for the students to discuss diagnostic strategies  treatment options including corrective surgery and conservative management  and the long-term complications and follow-up of patients with congenital heart diseases.

13,10,50,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial50,Case Report:  Patient Profile:  Name: Mark  Age: 3 months Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Past Medical History:  No significant past medical history. Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful. Mother's pregnancy medical history was clear - no evidence of maternal infections  drug use  diabetes or other major illnesses.  Chief Complaints:  Since birth  Mark’s parents have noticed a pattern of difficulty in feeding along with significant sweating. Over the past week  the baby has been refusing to eat  appears fatigued  and his skin has developed a bluish tinge (cyanosis). Mark's parents have also remarked he's been irritable and unusually lethargic  with periods of rapid breathing.  Physical Examination:  On examination  Mark’s weight gain seems to be below average for his age. His skin shows signs of mild cyanosis  particularly in the lips and nail beds. Precordial palpation shows a prominent right ventricular impulse. There is a harsh systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border.  Investigations:  Complete blood count  kidney function tests  and electrolyte levels are all within normal limits. The chest x-ray indicated a boot-shaped heart characteristic of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). An Echocardiography was recommended for further evaluation.  Assessment:  Given the clinical picture and parental reports  the primary concern is congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot. The cyanosis  failure to thrive  sweating during feeds  periods of rapid breathing and the systolic murmur are all indicative of this condition. An immediate cardiology consult is required to initiate a management plan.  [Note: This case should be used to guide further education on congenital heart disease  including but not limited to the understanding of different types of congenital heart disease (e.g. cyanotic or acyanotic)  their presentations  appropriate investigations  and general management.]
13,10,51,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial51,Patient Information:  Six-month-old female infant.  Past Medical History:  The infant was delivered full-term with no complications during pregnancy or delivery. There has been no history of illness or hospitalization before the current presentation.  Presenting Complaints: The parents report that the infant becomes tired easily  notably during feedings  where she often falls asleep before consuming optimal amounts of formula/breast milk. Additionally  they report that she does not gain weight in a typical manner  sitting below the average on the pediatric growth chart  despite regular feedings. They also note that the infant appears to have a bluish complexion  particularly around her lips and nails  during episodes of crying or feeding.  This case involves a clinical scenario indicative of congenital heart disease – more specifically  a case of cyanotic congenic heart disease. The symptoms point towards issues such as Tetralogy of Fallot or transposition of the great arteries  which need to be confirmed with further medical investigations like echocardiography.
13,10,52,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial52,Patient Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Patient: Amy Johnson Age: 3 months old Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Birth Weight: 6 pounds (2.7 kg) Current Weight: 10 pounds (4.5 kg) Height: 54 cm Residential Area: Suburban  Past Medical History: Amy was a full-term baby born via normal vaginal delivery. There were no reported incidents of complications during pregnancy or the birth process. Her birth weight and growth progression were considered within the normal range according to her age. Her immunizations are up to date.  Her family history reveals that Amy's maternal grandfather was diagnosed with a congenital heart disease  specifically a bicuspid aortic valve.  Key Complaints: Amy's parents have reported periodic episodes of rapid breathing and cyanotic episodes  especially following feeding. They have also noticed she has not been gaining weight at a normal rate and occasionally sweats excessively  often during feeding or playing. She appears to tire easily  wanting to sleep more often than the norm for her age group  and her parents also report she often seems unusually irritable.  Upon physical examination  a heart murmur is audible in her chest. Blood tests showed polycythemia and chest X-ray showed a slightly enlarged heart  particularly at the right ventricle region.   Taken together  these symptoms and signs are suggestive of a potential congenital heart disorder  warranting further investigation. An echocardiogram should be obtained for definitive diagnosis. Possible diagnoses to explore include Tetralogy of Fallot  transposition of the great vessels  or a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). Effective education of the parents regarding the importance of prompt and regular follow-up appointments is also significant in this case.
13,10,53,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial53,Case Report:  Patient Demographics  Name: M. Anderson Age: 3-years old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Location: Urban area  United States  Past Medical History  M. Anderson was born at full term with no immediate complications. Around the age of 2  his pediatrician noted that he was slower with physical growth and development compared to children his age. His parents reported that he often seemed tired  especially when participating in physical activities.  Key Complaints  Anderson's key complaints include a persistent heart murmur noted during routine check-ups  and an inability to keep up with peers during physical activities due to easily developing fatigue and breathlessness. He also exhibits a slight cyanosis (bluish discoloration) around the lips and fingertips  especially when crying or in cold weather. His mother has expressed concerns about his slower growth rate compared to other children his age and unusual pale skin coloration.   These chronic complaints had led to further investigation  including an echocardiogram  revealing a congenital heart defect. Further evaluation is to be done to classify the specific type of congenital heart disease the patient has and to determine his management and treatment options.
13,10,54,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial54,Patient Information:  Name: Anticipated Alias (e.g.  Baby John Doe) Age: 6 months Gender: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic  Past Medical History: He was a full-term baby delivered via normal vaginal delivery. There were no antenatal or perinatal events of note except a slight murmur was noted at birth. However  a follow-up exam at one month showed no abnormalities.  Presenting Complaints: Baby John Doe has been presenting with persistent poor feeding  excessive sweating  especially during feeds  and prolonged periods of sleepiness. The mother has also noticed that the baby has not been gaining weight properly and his body appears to look bluish around the mouth and the tips of his fingers and toes (cyanosis).  He was recently taken to a local clinic due to a cough and cold  where a pediatrician noted a heart murmur. The baby now is referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation.   Key Examination Findings: On physical examination  Baby John Doe looks smaller compared to other babies of the same age group. Mild respiratory distress is noted with subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest auscultation reveals a loud  harsh  holosystolic murmur heard best in the left lower sternal border. Oxygen saturation is slightly decreased. The rest of the physical examination is generally unremarkable.  Impression: Initial findings are indicative of a possible congenital heart disease. Further diagnostic investigations  including Echocardiography and chest x-ray  are recommended.   Teaching/Discussion Points: This case is intended to help students identify  understand and manage the clinical features of congenital heart disease in infants  with an emphasis on the importance of early recognition and intervention to enhance survival rates and improve quality of life. Students should also understand the difference between acyanotic and cyanotic heart defects  and be familiar with common congenital heart defects like ventricular septal defect  atrial septal defect  patent ductus arteriosus  tetralogy of Fallot  and transposition of great arteries. Students should learn about various management strategies including medication  intervention procedures  and surgery. Discuss the vital role of lifelong follow-up care for these patients.

Prenatal history significant for mother reporting a healthy pregnancy with regular antenatal follow-ups  no reported exposure to drugs  alcohol or cigarette smoke during the pregnancy. Since birth  patient's lack of appetite  poor weight gain and increased breathing rate was noted by the parents.  Key Complaints: The parents have brought him to the pediatrician's office reporting concerns about his feeding. They note that he becomes excessively sweaty and breathless after feeds  and he often needs breaks during the feeding. The parents report that although he feeds regularly  he does not seem to be gaining enough weight. They also mention that his lips and nail beds sometimes look blue  especially when he cries.  + Assessment: These symptoms warrant further investigation for possible congenital heart disease.
13,10,56,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial56,Patient Case: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Demographics: Name: Baby Jones Sex: Female Age: 3 months Ethnicity: Caucasian Birthplace: New York  USA Birth weight: 3.3 kgs  Past Medical History: The infant demonstrates notable failure to thrive since birth  with inadequate weight gain despite adequate feeding. She was a full-term baby born through normal vaginal delivery with an uncomplicated prenatal period.  Key Complaints: Baby Jones has been displaying cyclic cyanosis  particularly during feeding or crying. Parents also report persistent tachypnea (rapid breathing) and recurrent respiratory infections since birth. The baby often appears irritable  excessively tired and has difficulty feeding. Episodes of poor weight gain and profuse sweating were also reported.  Physical Examination Findings: Upon physical examination  the infant demonstrates poor weight gain  tachypnea  and poor peripheral perfusion. Auscultation reveals a loud  harsh murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border and a palpable thrill on precordial exam.   Potential Diagnoses:  Given the infant's symptoms and physical findings  clinical suspicion is high for congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot.  Investigations: Further diagnostic evaluations including chest X-ray  EKG  and an echocardiogram are warranted to confirm the suspected diagnosis.   Management Strategy: Once the diagnosis is confirmed  a comprehensive management strategy will be developed. It will encompass nutritional support to promote growth  palliative procedure  along with eventual surgical correction of the defect for long-term management.  Educational Goals:  With this case  the goal is to make medical students understand the signs and symptoms of congenital heart disease in infants  in this case  Tetralogy of Fallot. Students should learn how to diagnose and manage this condition  and when to refer patients for surgical correction. They should also understand the importance of involving parents in managing their infant's condition and the necessity of multidisciplinary care in complex congenital heart diseases.
13,10,57,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial57,Patient Information: A 2-month-old Hispanic female baby born full term without complications.  Patient Complaints: The mother reports that her baby has difficulty feeding  sweating excessively  especially during feedings  rapid breathing  and cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin  lips  and nail beds). She also noticed that her baby seems to tire very easily  compared to other babies of the same age.  Past Medical History: The baby was born to a 32-year-old gravida 2 para 2 mother with an unremarkable antenatal history. No family history of congenital heart diseases. The baby's APGAR scores were normal at birth.  Given these observations  a congenital heart disease is suspected. The student's role would be to work through the differential diagnoses  perform a thorough examination  understand the importance of performing an echocardiogram  initiate the right treatment plans  and understand the prognosis for the potential diseases of concern.
13,10,58,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial58,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Demographics:  The patient is a 5-year-old male child with an Indo-European background  living in a suburban area with his first-degree relatives. He is in kindergarten  and his development is appropriate for his age. His birth was vaginal at full term with no complications.  Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed at birth with Tetralogy of Fallot  a type of congenital heart disease. He underwent a successful corrective surgery at 6 months of age  with regular follow-ups at the pediatric cardiology clinic. The last echocardiogram performed six months ago showed a good postoperative status with a small residual ventricular septal defect (VSD). His vaccinations are up-to-date  allergies are non-documented  and he doesn't take any regular medications.  The family history is remarkable for a cousin on his mother's side who had an unspecified heart defect. There is no history of mental health disorders  diabetes  or hypertension in her proximate family. His parents are non-smokers  and there are no known environmental exposures.  Key Complaints:  The parents have recently observed increased fatigue  particularly evidenced during physical activities such as playing at a kindergarten. They also reported episodes of cyanotic spells and difficulty in breathing  especially in the morning. He experienced one syncopal episode this past week after coming back from a game. These episodes have caused significant concern for his parents who also noted a decrease in appetite and weight loss over the past two months. The child denies any chest pain  palpitations  or dizziness. No history of fever  cough  or other upper respiratory tract infection symptoms.  The combination of fatigue  cyanotic spells  difficulty breathing  appetite loss  and weight loss in a child with diagnosed congenital heart disease in his past medical history suggests the possibility of post-surgical complications or progression of a previously known small residual VSD. The new onset syncopal episode warrants a thorough cardiovascular evaluation.
13,10,59,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial59,Case Report  Patient Information: Female newborn infant  4 days old  born full-term via spontaneous vaginal delivery  no complications.  Past Medical History: The patient was born to a 32-year-old gravida 2  para 2 mother with no prenatal complications. The mother had routine prenatal care - all antenatal tests were normal including gestational diabetes and Group B Streptococcus screening. There was no history of maternal drug or alcohol use  and no family history of heart disease. The mother's prenatal ultrasounds were all normal.  Key Complaints: Since birth  the infant has been experiencing difficulties with feeding which are gradually worsening. Nurses have observed the newborn to be sweating more than usual  especially during feedings  and appearing fatigued afterwards. The infant has also been observed to be slightly cyanotic around her lips and extremities  especially during feedings. Further concerns of the infant's parents include fewer wet diapers than expected and failure to gain weight proportionately since birth. The infant has not shown interest in feeding on certain occasions leading to less than expected intake of milk.   Objective findings: On physical examination  the infant is found irritable  with visible respiratory distress. The vital signs show mild tachycardia and mild tachypnea. The auscultation of the chest detects a heart murmur which was not noticed at birth. Rest of the physical examination appears normal.  These symptoms  findings  physical signs  and history raise a high suspicion of congenital heart disease. Further investigation through echocardiogram is recommended at this stage.
13,10,60,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial60,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  A four-month-old African American female infant  first-born  born full term through natural vaginal delivery with no immediate perinatal complications. Her parents are non-consanguineous  and there's no familial history of heart disease or any known genetic disorders. They reside in a suburban community.  Past Medical History:  The patient was healthy until the last month when she was noted to have feeding difficulties  including shortness of breath while breastfeeding and choking. The mother also reported that the baby seemed to be gaining weight slower than before. No previous hospitalizations or daily medications. There have been normal growth and developmental milestones for her age.  Key Complaints:  The presenting complaints include unexplained bouts of rapid breathing  failure to gain weight  excessive sweating  and fatigue particularly during feeding. She also appears to be less active compared to before. On assessment  there is a noticeable bluish discoloration (cyanosis) of fingertips and lips  especially when she cries. The primary care physician identified a heart murmur during a routine check-up.  The case combines some of the common signs and symptoms of congenital heart disease that medical students should be familiar with  such as feeding difficulties  failure to thrive  shortness of breath  profuse sweating  less activity  and cyanosis. Special emphasis is placed on the significance of a heart murmur in infants  which often raises suspicion for a possible congenital cardiac anomaly.
13,10,61,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial61,Case Details:  Patient Information: Baby Boy  3 months old  Caucasian   Past Medical History: Born full term with no complications during delivery or immediate postnatal period. His mother had regular prenatal visits that showed no anomalies. Birth weight was 2.9 kg. No history of any significant illness or hospital admission after discharge from the hospital. Immunizations are up to date. There is no family history of congenital heart disease.  Presenting Complaints: Mother has noticed the baby turning blue  especially during feeds  crying or some activity. She also stated the baby seems to sweat more than her two other children did at his age and does not seem to be gaining weight despite eating well. There is also noted increased breathing rate and shortness of breath.  Key Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  the baby looks small for his age with weight below the 10th percentile. He has mild perioral cyanosis (blueness around the mouth). Cardiac examination reveals a single S2 heart sound and a medium-pitched systolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border. There are no signs of heart failure.  From these complaints and examination  the differential diagnosis should mainly include cyanotic congenital heart diseases  particularly Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Further investigation includes Chest X-Ray  ECG and an echocardiogram that will provide much supportive evidence to the presumed diagnosis.  Discussion: TOF is a congenital heart defect which is classically understood to involve four anatomical abnormalities of the heart. It is the most common cyanotic heart disease.  Teaching points for this case:  1. Recognize the signs and symptoms of congenital heart diseases in infants (failure to thrive  cyanosis  abnormal heart sounds). 2. To understand the significance of a detailed physical examination. 3. To understand and interpret the key investigations required. 4. Differentiating between cyanotic and acyanotic heart diseases. 5. Management plan for congenital heart diseases.
13,10,62,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial62,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Demographics: Gender: Male Age: 6 months Ethnicity: Caucasian Place of Birth: Rural Texas  Past Medical History: The infant was delivered at 39 weeks via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy and delivery were both uneventful. There is no family history of congenital heart disease. The baby has had regular pediatric checks that recorded normal developmental milestones  and no previous hospitalizations or surgeries have occurred. All immunizations are up-to-date.  Key Complaints: The mother has recently observed that the baby gets tired easily while feeding and breathes fast. She also mentioned that her son is not as active as the other babies of the same age and doesn't seem to be gaining as much weight. Over the last week  she has noticed that her son's lips  tongue  and nail beds occasionally turn a bluish tint  especially during feeding. The mother also reports increased sweating  especially around the head  during what seems to be minimal activity.  Medical students will be asked to consider this information to come up with possible diagnoses  further investigations  and management plans. The main focus will be on congenital heart diseases such as Tetralogy of Fallot or Transposition of the great vessels.
13,10,63,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial63,Patient Profile: Name: John Doe Age: 3 months Sex: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian   Past Medical History:  John Doe is a 3-month-old infant who was term born without any delivery complications to a primiparous mother through normal vaginal delivery. The prenatal history was uneventful  but the patient had experienced transient tachypnea immediately after birth  which was quickly resolved without medical intervention.  The mother has a history of rheumatic heart disease but had no fever or infections during pregnancy. There is no family history of congenital heart disease. The baby was breastfed and achieved all expected developmental milestones.  Key Complaints: For the past three weeks  the mother noticed that the baby is taking longer to finish feeding and tends to sweat a lot during feeds. She has also noticed occasional bouts of rapid breathing and poor weight gain. She brought John for his routine pediatrician appointment  where a heart murmur was detected. The pediatrician referred the infant to a pediatric cardiologist due to suspicion of congenital heart disease.  Thus  this case demands the trainees to interpret the patient's history  recognize the signs indicative of potential congenital heart disease  and formulate appropriate differential diagnoses  investigations  and management plans.
13,10,64,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial64,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Patient Initials: JD Sex: Male Age: 6 months Ethnicity: Caucasian  Location: Rural area in Kentucky  Past Medical History: JD was delivered via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 38 weeks. Mother denied any substance use  illness  or infections during pregnancy. She also denied any exposure to radiation  chronic medications or illicit substances. The pregnancy was uneventful  Prenatal screens were all negative. The child passed neonatal screening. The birth weight was 8lb 2 oz. He has been feeding satisfactorily and gaining weight.  Immunizations are up-to-date. At 4 weeks  however  parents noticed that JD becomes breathless while feeding  with increased lethargy and poor weight gain. There were no episodes of unconsciousness  bluish discoloration  convulsion  or puffiness of the face or lower limbs.  Key Complaints: JD was brought into the clinic by his parents with chief complaints of difficulty in feeding  excessive sweating  particularly during feeds  and poor weight gain. The parents also mention that JD becomes fatigued and breathless very quickly. JD's skin is noticeably mottled  and has a bluish hue (cyanosis). Additionally  the parents report that he has not been as responsive and playful as he used to be. His mother also cites lethargy as a concern.   Remember that these are signs and symptoms of potential heart failure in an infant which need to be addressed urgently. Congenital heart disease such as Tetralogy of Fallot  Transposition of the great arteries  Tricuspid atresia  Total anomalous pulmonary venous return  Persistent truncus arteriosus or Hypoplastic left heart syndrome could be the underlying cause. The next step would be to refer JD to a pediatric cardiologist for a definitive diagnosis.
13,10,65,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial65,Patient's Case:  Demographics:   Name: Baby John Doe Age: 6 months old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Residential locale: Urban Date: January 20  2023  Past Medical History:  John is otherwise a healthy baby boy born full-term via vaginal delivery without any complications. His regular immunizations are up to date. The mother's pregnancy was unremarkable with no known exposure to teratogens. There's no relevant finding during prenatal ultrasounds and no family history of congenital heart disease. However  his pediatrician noted an unusual heart murmur in the first month check-up.  Key Complaints:  John's parents have noted that he tires easily during feeding and does not seem to be gaining weight as expected. He also has episodes of rapid breathing and sometimes appears blue around his lips and tips of his fingers. Today  he seems excessively sweaty  bound to drowsiness  and shows decreased alertness. His feeding has also been poor.  Note for medical students:  This scenario is designed to introduce you to a potential case of congenital heart disease. The symptoms observed - feeding difficulties  slow weight gain  cyanosis (blueness)  tachypnea (rapid breathing)  and increased perspiration - may suggest a cardiac abnormality. The heart murmur detected gives a strong clue towards a congenital defect.   Your task will be to consider the appropriate diagnostic strategies - including physical examination  necessary lab investigations  and imaging (like an echocardiogram) to firm up your diagnosis. Further  you will need to consider the complications of such conditions and how they might manifest in a pediatric patient  and plan a consequent management strategy. Please consider this in the context of both immediate care and long-term management.  Care must be taken to include differential diagnoses in your evaluations such as sepsis  lung diseases  metabolic disorders  etc. Your management strategy should consider both medical and possibly surgical approaches (based on your diagnosis) in infants diagnosed with congenital heart disease.
13,10,66,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial66,Patient Information: Male  2-month-old  Asian  Presenting Complaints: The baby has problems with feeding and doesn't gain weight appropriately. The parents also reported excessive sweating and fatigue especially during feeding. They also noticed their baby often gets short of breath and has noticeable fast breathing.   Past Medical History: The baby was carried to term with an uneventful pregnancy. However  the mother had gestational diabetes that was managed by diet throughout her pregnancy. There is no history of any family with congenital heart disease or other chromosomal abnormalities.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  the baby appeared underweight. Auscultation revealed a heart murmur. There is mild hepatomegaly.  Plan: Suspecting a congenital heart disease  referral to a pediatric cardiologist is urgent for further diagnostic evaluation (like echocardiogram  chest X-ray  pulse oximetry) and to determine the appropriate treatment.  Possible Diagnosis: Congenital heart disease  such as Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) or Tetralogy of Fallot. Further diagnostic tests will help to confirm the diagnosis.
13,10,67,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial67,Patient Case Report:  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 6-month old Hispanic male infant  born full-term via an uneventful spontaneous vaginal delivery. Birth weight was 3.5 kg  and no immediate postnatal complications were noted. He receives routine check-ups at the local health clinic and has not been hospitalized before.  Past Medical History: The infant has had regular wellness visits with no significant illnesses to date. His immunizations are up to date  and he has had a normal growth pattern and developmental milestones according to his age. His parents are young and healthy  with no significant medical issues. Though  they report some distant history of heart disease in their extended family.  Presentation and Key Complaints: The infant's mother brought him to the clinic for his scheduled wellness checkup  during which she reported concerns about the infant's difficulty in feeding. She has noticed him becoming tired quickly during feeding  getting sweaty  and failing to gain weight over the past month. Additionally  she reports increased fussiness  and some episodes of rapid  labored breathing. She also mentions a soft but persistent cough that has recently developed.  This pediatric case presents an opportunity to open up an investigation into the causes of these symptoms  with a focus on congenital heart disease including pathophysiology  appropriate investigation methods  clinical management  and patient and parent education. The training case should encourage students to consider differential diagnoses and justify why their leading diagnosis is the most likely. It provides an opportunity to discuss different types of congenital heart disease  their presentations  and associated clinical management strategies.
13,10,68,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial68,Patient Profile:  Patient Initials: R.D. Age: 6 months Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian   Past Medical History: R.D. was full-term at birth with a normal vaginal delivery. However  during the newborn period  a heart murmur was identified upon routine physical check-up. No family history of any congenital heart diseases  genetic abnormalities or related sibling deaths. He has been growing and achieving all major infant developmental milestones in accordance with his age.   Presenting Complaints: R.D.’s parents were concerned because of the child’s notable fatigue during feeding  slower weight gain compared to other infants of similar age  and frequent respiratory infections over the past couple of months. They also noticed that R.D. often appeared slightly blue  particularly around the lips and finger beds  especially after crying or feeding.   Key Clinical Findings: Aside from the distinct signs of cyanosis  increase in respiratory rate and effort and a palpable liver  a cardiac examination also exhibited a palpable parasternal heave and a harsh pan systolic murmur heard best at the left sternal edge. Apart from this  no abnormalities were noted during other systemic examinations.   Plan and Diagnosis: Initial considerations include some form of cyanotic congenital heart disease. Immediate investigations like chest X-ray  EKG and eventually Echocardiography need to be planned to get a clear picture of structural and functional cardiac anomalies. Based on the clinical findings  diagnosing a congenital heart disease such as Tetralogy of Fallot can be suspected. Immediate referral to a pediatric cardiologist is essential for further confirmation of diagnosis and management plan.

Objective Findings: - Weight: Below the 5th percentile for his age - Heart: The presence of a heart murmur - Skin: Cyanosis observed particularly around his lips - Lungs: Increased respiratory rate  This case presentation will challenge medical students to explore the potential causes of these symptoms  which strongly suggest a cardiovascular problem  likely a form of congenital heart disease. Medical students should be encouraged to consider what further diagnostic tests might be necessary and how to manage and communicate with the family of a child with such a diagnosis.
13,10,70,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial70,"Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Demographics   Name: Baby John Doe Age: 6 months Sex: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian   Past Medical History  Baby John was born full-term without any complications. There is no history of significant illness since birth. No occurrence of frequent respiratory diseases  or allergic reactions. Vaccinations are up-to-date as per age. He has been exclusively breastfed. There is no history of any developmental delays. No known family history of congenital heart diseases or early cardiac deaths.   Key Complaints   The key complaints presented by the mother are that Baby John tends to become cyanotic during feeding and shows poor weight gain compared to peers. He necessitates frequent breaks during feeding due to shortness of breath. Additionally  he tends to sweat more than normal  especially during feeding or crying. He has shown reduced activity levels compared to his twin brother.  This case focuses on a type of congenital heart defect known as """"tetralogy of Fallot"""". Tetralogy of Fallot causes poor oxygenation  leading to cyanosis  poor weight gain  tiring easily  and increased sweat production."
13,10,71,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial71,Patient Demographics: - Name: Patient X - Age: 3 months old - Gender: Male - Race: Caucasian - Residence: Urban area  Past Medical History: - Born full-term with no complications during delivery - No known allergies  - Immunizations up to date - No prior admissions or surgical history - Parents are non-consanguineous with no history of congenital heart diseases - No siblings  Key Complaints: The patient was brought in by his parents who reported that the baby has been exhibiting symptoms such as: - Rapid breathing  - Difficulty in feeding  - Excessive sweating  especially during feeding - Turning blue around the lips and beneath the nails - Seeming tired and irritable most of the times - Poor weight gain  In the clinic  an initial physical examination revealed a systolic heart murmur.

13,10,72,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial72,Patient Profile:  Name: Jane Doe Age: 6 months  Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Past Medical History: Non-contributory Family History: Father underwent surgery for a congenital heart defect at a young age.  Chief Complaints:  Jane's parents report poor growth  frequent occurrences of rapid breathing  excessive sweating particularly during feeding  and frequent respiratory infections.  Case Report:  Jane Doe is a 6-month-old baby girl brought into the clinic by her parents who report that she is failing to gain weight appropriately and struggling with frequent respiratory infections. Her parents have also noticed excessive sweating during feeding and rapid breathing on multiple occasions.  There is no significant past medical history  no allergies reported and immunizations are up-to-date. Jane is exclusively breastfed  hasn't introduced solids yet due to concerns about her poor growth.   The family history is significant for heart defects: Jane's father had a congenital heart disease that required surgical intervention during his early childhood and paternal uncle died in infancy due to complications related to heart surgery. Jane's mother is healthy and there are no significant diseases among her siblings.  On examination  Jane is alert and active  but appears smaller than average for her age group. She has noticeable cyanosis of the lips and tongue. On cardiac examination  there is an asymmetrical cardiac apex due to enlarged right ventricle. Auscultation reveals a loud  harsh  and high-pitched holosystolic murmur noted along the left lower sternal border which is characteristic for congenital heart disease  specifically Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD).  This case should be approached from the perspective of congenital heart diseases  with the focus being on VSD considering the symptoms and history. The students should be taught about the:   - importance of history taking and physical examination  - physiological reasoning behind the symptoms (cyanosis  failure to thrive  tachypnoea) - diagnostic modalities such as chest X-Rays  Echocardiograms  and other methods - detailed understanding of the heart defect  its mechanism  pathology  and overall clinical implications  - short-term and long-term management of VSDs and other congenital heart diseases  - potential complications in untreated or late-diagnosed cases  - importance of genetic counseling considering the hereditary pattern of congenital heart diseases.
13,10,73,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial73,Patient Information: - Age: 6 months old - Gender: Female - Ethnicity: Hispanic - Birth History: Full-term spontaneous vaginal delivery with no complications  Past Medical History:  - The patient's prenatal period was largely uneventful  with regular visits to the OB-GYN.  - Birth weight: 3.6 kg.  - She was vaccinated according to the schedule. - She has been breastfed exclusively.  Key Complaints:  - Persistent fast breathing and sweating  - Poor feeding  which affects growth (failure to thrive) - Often appears tired during feeding (both breasts and bottle). - Time to time turned blue (cyanosis) during crying periods.  Physical Examination: - Slightly increased heart rate (tachycardia) - Mild cyanosis observed around the lips - Auscultation of the heart revealed a murmur  indicating potential structural abnormalities - Weight is considerably below the standard for her age.  These symptoms are suggesting a presentation of a congenital heart disease  which needs to be confirmed by further diagnostic procedures such as an electrocardiogram (EKG)  chest X-ray and an echocardiogram. Some congenital heart diseases which might be considered based on the presented symptoms are Tetralogy of Fallot  ventricular septal defect  or pulmonary stenosis. It would be critical to include in the teaching case follow-ups such as specific diagnostic tool results  the decision-making process for treatment  and the chosen course of treatment and prognosis.

No history of recurrent respiratory infections or failure to thrive.  Key Complaints: The mother has recently observed that the baby becomes excessively tired and experiences shortness of breath during feeding. The mother reported that the baby's weight gain has been slow and is not consistent with the growth chart. She also observed that the baby's skin often turns a bluish color especially around the lips and fingertips. The patient has been tiring out easily  sweating excessively  and has been more irritable than usual.  These symptoms raised concern about the likelihood of a critical heart condition  specifically pointing towards a likelihood of a congenital heart defect. This case aims to educate the medical trainees about the potential signs of congenital heart disease in infants and the necessity for early diagnosis and treatment options.
13,10,76,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial76,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Demographics: Baby J is a 1-month-old Caucasian female child born to a 33-year-old gravida 2 para 2 otherwise healthy mother. The delivery was full term and happened normally through vaginal birth with no complications. The baby had normal apgar score at birth. The family history shows no genetic disorders or congenital diseases.   Past Medical History: Primarily  Baby J has been healthy since birth with no episodes of illness or infection. The prenatal ultrasounds were normal with no pathologies detected. She was exclusively breastfeeding  with proper weight gain and good diaper output. Her immunizations were up-to-date and newborn screening was also normal. The mother had regular prenatal appointments and vitamins. There were no maternal infections  drug use  or smoking during pregnancy.  Presenting Complaints: During a routine check-up  Baby J was found to have some signs of a possible heart issue. Her pediatrician noted cyanosis especially on feeding and crying. There were times when Baby J turned bluish around the lips  which were noted by her parents. The physical examination revealed a mild growth retardation  a systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border and clubbing. She also was found to have poor feeding since last week.  The clinical scenario above presents possible signs of a congenital heart disease  particularly Tetralogy of Fallot. Further diagnostic tests such as an echocardiogram need to be performed to confirm the diagnosis. This case aims to make the students familiar with the presentation and clinical signs of congenital heart diseases in neonates.
13,10,77,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial77,Patient Details: Gender: Female Age: 6 months  Past Medical History: The patient has had regular check-ups since birth  and all previous examinations were normal  with no abnormal signs and symptoms noted. She was born at term from a non-consanguineous marriage. Prenatal ultrasounds were normal  with no other health concerns during the pregnancy. There is no significant family history of congenital heart disease.  Key Complaints: In the last month  parents observed that the infant becomes scared  screams  and turns blue especially after crying or feeding. The infant has poor weight gain despite normal diet and appetite. Also  there are episodes of rapid breathing and sweating while feeding or crying.  The primary care physician noticed that the baby has a heart murmur and peripheral pulses were bounding. Shortness of breath and clubbing of fingers were observed too.  From these presenting complaints  it is essential to consider the possibility of a congenital heart disease. A referral for more specialized cardiac testing such as echocardiography would be recommended for a more concrete diagnosis.
13,10,78,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial78,Patient Information:   Demographics:  The patient is a six-month-old female infant named Emily. She is from Mexico City  Mexico  lives with both parents  and has a two-year-old brother. She was born at term through normal delivery without any complications.   Past Medical History: Emily was diagnosed with Down Syndrome at birth based on physical characteristics and confirmed by chromosomal analysis. Her growth and development have been closely monitored  and she's had regular check-ups with her pediatrician. She has no known drug allergies. No previous hospitalizations or surgical history.   Family History: There's no family history of congenital heart diseases. Both parents are healthy. Her older brother is also healthy.  Chief Complaints: Emily was brought in by her mother with the main concern of feeding difficulties. Emily has become increasingly lethargic  sweats with only minimal exertion  such as during feeds  and shows signs of poor weight gain in the past month. Her mother mentions that Emily seems to breathe faster than normal  even when at rest.      These symptoms suggest Emily may have a heart condition that needs further investigation. In infants with Down Syndrome  congenital heart disease  particularly congenital defects like AVSD (Atrioventricular Septal Defect)  is a common concern. Emily's symptoms of increased work to breathe (tachypnea)  poor weight gain  and sweating may be indicative of congestive heart failure secondary to her potential heart condition.  A suggested line of investigation would involve a full cardiovascular examination  chest X-ray  EKG  and an echocardiogram. Depending on the findings  referral to a pediatric cardiologist for potential intervention might be necessary.
13,10,79,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial79,Case Report: Congital Heart Defect  Patient Information: Male  3 months  Caucasian   Presenting Complaints:  The patient's mother has noticed the baby seems to tire easily  especially during feeding. He also seems to be breathing quickly  even when at rest. Moreover  she has observed a blue tinge around the baby's lips and fingernails particularly during crying episodes.  Past Medical History:  The baby was born at full term via normal vaginal delivery with uneventful prenatal care. Birth weight was 7.2lbs  and Apgar scores were 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. He received standard vaccinations (HepB  RV  DTaP  Hib  PCV13  IPV) at his two-month check-up.  Family History: No history of congenital heart diseases or other genetic diseases in the family. The mother and father are both healthy  non-smokers  and there's no history of drug or alcohol abuse.  Physical Examination: On examination  the baby appeared to be somewhat dyspneic and cyanotic (around lips and nails) particularly when crying. His weight was in the 25th percentile for his age. Heart rate was a bit fast - tachycardia (165 beats per minute)  regular rhythm. Upon auscultation  a loud  harsh murmur best heard over the left sternal border was found. Both lungs were clear to auscultation. No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly was detected.   Initial Laboratory Evaluation: Blood tests and Electrocardiogram (ECG) were recommended for further characterization of the heart murmur and cyanotic episodes.   The purpose of this case scenario would be to engage medical students in an exercise to identify  diagnose  and discuss appropriate treatments for a possible congenital heart defect. This could include further tests such as a chest x-ray  cardiac MRI or echocardiography  as well as potential treatment plans  such as medications  procedures to correct the defect  and the role of lifelong follow-up in congenital heart disease. 
13,10,80,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial80,Patient Case:  Patient Demographics: - Name: Unknown - Age: 14 days old - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian  Past Medical History:  The patient is a 14-day old male who had an unremarkable prenatal history. The mother is a 28-year-old G1P1 with no known medical conditions. She had regular prenatal care and no known prenatal exposures. The baby was born at term via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. Birth weight was 3.2 kg. No complications were noted at birth  and APGAR scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes  respectively.   The patient's bilirubin level became high on day 3 of life  requiring phototherapy  but then resolved. His initial newborn screening test results were normal. The baby was exclusively breastfed  gaining weight appropriately  and had no known drug allergies.   Key Complaints:  Today  during a routine health check  the pediatrician noticed a pronounced heart murmur. Additionally  the mother mentioned the baby has been feeding poorly and appears lethargic in the past two days.   On examination  the baby showed signs of cyanosis  mainly noticeable on the lips and fingertips. The pediatrician also observed mild clubbing of the fingers. The baby appeared slightly underweight and was somewhat listless during the examination.  Possible Discussions:  From this case  the students should understand that the combination of cyanosis  poor feeding  lethargy  and a new heart murmur in a newborn can point towards congenital heart disease. The learning goal here is to identify and learn how to manage common pediatric cardiology problems  focusing on cyanotic congenital heart conditions. In specific  conditions like Tetralogy of Fallot  transposition of the great arteries  and Tricuspid atresia should be discussed primarily.  Next steps like getting an ECG  Chest X-ray  and a consult for a Paediatrician Cardiologist for an echocardiogram must be emphasized as part of the management plan. Treatment plan may vary based on specific diagnosis and can include surgery as well as non-surgical interventions.

She appears bluish around her lips and tongue after crying  and has not been gaining weight adequately which the mother associates with Jane’s reduced feeding.  Objective Examination:  Jane appears small for her stated age (the 3rd percentile for height and weight). On auscultation  cardiopulmonary examination revealed a grade 3/6 pansystolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border. Oxygen saturation was 88% in room air.  In this case scenario  medical students are required to evaluate the presented case  considering the patient’s symptoms  clinical examination results  and their knowledge of embryology  anatomy  and pathophysiology to formulate possible differential diagnoses. The primary objective is to lead the students towards the diagnosis of congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot  and think about possible management and treatment options.    Teaching points would include the diagnosis and management of congenital heart disease and the importance of early recognition and intervention for the best outcomes. This will delve into interpreting clinical signs such as the murmur  cyanosis  and failure to thrive  and how these might relate to blood flow within the heart. Students should also explore the potential complications and prognosis for children with this condition.
13,10,83,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial83,Patient Profile:   Patient Initials: K.S. Age: 2 years Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Presenting Symptoms: Cyanosis  shortness of breath  fatigue  poor feeding   Chief Complaints:  K.S.'s mother reports that the child often turns blue  especially on crying and feeding. He is suffering from bouts of quick  rapid breathing and doesn't seem to have as much energy as other children his age. He has also not been eating well and has poor weight gain.   Past Medical History: K.S. was born full term via an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Mother's pregnancy was unremarkable with no exposure to illness or drugs. First noticed cyanosis at 3 months of age; however  this was initially dismissed as being due to cold exposure.   Notable for failure to thrive  chronic intermittent respiratory infections since 8 months of age. No surgeries or hospital admissions. Immunizations are up to date. Growth parameters in lower percentiles for age.   Family History: No significant family history of congenital heart disease  sudden cardiac death or dyslipidemia. Maternal grandfather has ischemic heart disease  but was diagnosed in his late 70s.   Social History: Lives with his mother and father who are non-smokers. No pets in the home. No known lead exposure. Mother works at a college while father is a computer analyst.   Assessment: On examination  K.S. appeared slightly dyspneic with observable cyanosis. On auscultation  a cardiac murmur was noted. Poor weight gain in correlation with difficulty feeding  rapid breathing  and frequent respiratory infections indicates a strong possibility of congenital heart disease.   The presenting symptoms and clinical findings strongly indicate a congenital cardiac anomaly  possibly Tetralogy of Fallot  which typically presents with cyanotic spells  characteristic murmur  and failure to thrive. Further diagnostic evaluation such as echocardiography and chest radiograph (CXR) will be pursued to confirm findings. Early diagnosis and operative intervention are critical for ensuring better prognosis and reducing morbidity in these patients.   This case is to emphasize the importance of detailed history taking and thorough clinical examination in early detection of congenital heart disease in pediatric population.   Note: The above case is a constructed scenario for educational purposes. It does not describe actual individual's health information.
13,10,84,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial84,Case Report  Patient Demographics  Name: John Doe Age: Newborn  3 days old Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian  Birth Weight: 3 kg Birth Length: 49 cm Delivery: Normal Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery APGAR Score: 8  Past Medical History  The medical history is yet to be established since the patient is a newborn. Prenatal history includes a term pregnancy to a 28-year old gravida 2  para 1 mother. The mother had regular prenatal care  no history of prenatal drug exposure or genetic abnormalities. The immediate postnatal period was uneventful.   Key Complaints  The newborn was brought for a regular well-baby visit. Upon initial evaluation  a murmur was heard during the cardiac examination. The baby also presented with cyanosis  tachypnea  poor feeding  and activity less than normal.  Physical examination revealed a low-grade systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border. An oxygen saturation of 82% on room air was recorded. Mild intercostal retractions were noted  along with mildly decreased peripheral perfusion.  These symptoms warranted an echocardiogram for further clarification regarding the underlying cardiac condition. Relevant Findings: The Echocardiogram showed a structural abnormality of the heart suggestive of Tetralogy of Fallot.   Appropriate interventions  patient management and potential outcomes will be discussed further in the case study.   This case prompts a discussion on the importance of early detection and management of neonatal congenital heart disease.  Remember  while the infant in this case presents classic signs of congenital heart disease  symptoms can vary significantly in their presentation. For a comprehensive understanding  further discussion about other forms and presentations of congenital heart disease should follow.
13,10,85,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial85,Patient Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Demographics: Patient Name: XY Age: 6 months Sex: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic Location: Urban  Past Medical History:  Seen at birth by neonatologist for mild cyanosis. Mother's pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes  but managed through diet. Prenatal scans did not reveal any abnormalities. Normal birth weight and gestational age. No siblings or immediate family with heart disease of any type.   Key Complaints:  Mother brought the child to the pediatrician's office for regular follow-up visit. She reported intermittent episodes of rapid breathing  excessive sweating especially while feeding and mild cyanosis  noticed mostly after crying episodes. She also reported poor weight gain and less activity compared to babies of similar age.  Physical examination revealed a failure to thrive - weight below the 3rd percentile for age and gender. The heart rate was mildly increased  lungs were clear to auscultation but there was evidence of a heart murmur – palpable thrill at the left sternal border and an audible mid-diastolic murmur loudest at the apex.   These signs prompted further evaluation  leading to a presumptive diagnosis of congenital heart disease  specifically a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD).  [Note: This case is designed to prompt medical students to consider congenital heart diseases with symptoms like failure to thrive  cyanosis  heart murmur  and complications of increased work of breathing and feeding. This prompts critical thinking for diagnosis and can be extended to discuss the importance of early detection  diagnostic procedures like Echocardiogram  necessary interventions  and importance of interprofessional coordination.]
13,10,86,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial86,Case Report:  Patient Details  Name: Anonymous  Gender: Female Age: 1 year Ethnicity: Hispanic Residence: Urban setting   Past Medical History  Notable prenatal history: No drug or alcohol use during pregnancy. Mother had gestational diabetes but was controlled with diet modifications. Perinatal history: The baby was born full term via a normal vaginal delivery with no postnatal complications.  Vaccination status: Up to date as per schedule  Key Complaints  The parents brought the child in with complaints of:  1. Poor feeding habits: the baby gets tired easily while breastfeeding. 2. Repeated chest infections: the baby has had 3 lower respiratory tract infections over the past 6 months.  3. Slow physical growth and weight gain compared to other kids of her age. 4. The baby often becomes breathless and sweaty  especially during feeds. 5. Recently  they observed a bluish color (cyanosis) on her lips and skin during a crying episode.  This is their first child  and they are extremely worried about her health issues. The parents denied any family history of congenital heart disease  sudden death  or genetic disorders  but the father has type II diabetes and the maternal grandmother has hypertension.  The purpose of this case presentation is to train the students in recognizing the signs and symptoms of Pediatric Congenital heart disease  specifically Tetralogy of Fallot  conducting a thorough physical examination  interpreting diagnostic tests  and managing the disease comprehensively. The students will understand the disease's pathophysiology  clinical manifestation  complications  and importance of early diagnosis and intervention for a better prognosis. 
13,10,87,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial87,Case Report:  Case Title: Congital Heart Disease in a Newborn  Patient Information: Name: Baby Doe Age: 0 (2 weeks old) Sex: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Birth weight: 3 kg Current Weight: 2.8 kg  Past Medical History: Baby Doe is a 2-week-old newborn with a history of delayed growth development since birth. During pregnancy  her mother reported no significant health issues  and the prenatal course was unremarkable. Her Apgar score was 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. She was noticed to be slightly cyanotic at birth  but it was attributed to normal newborn adjustments. At her postnatal follow-ups  she was found to have lost weight and not gained any since her birth. There were no complications during the delivery  and Baby Doe was delivered at term.  Presenting Complaints: The baby's complaints include difficulty feeding  inadequate weight gain  persistent mild cyanosis  and fast breathing. The mother also reports episodes of fast heart rate and the baby seems to get tired easily  particularly during feeds. It was also noticed that Baby Doe develops a bluish tint when crying.  Physical Examination Findings: Upon physical examination  there is a slight blue tint to the baby’s skin and lips (mild cyanosis). She exhibits signs of shortness of breath and fast breathing (tachypnea). Her body weight is less than the reference range. A heart murmur was heard on cardiac examination  which was consistent with a possible defect in the heart structure.  This type of case would set a good foundation for medical students to start thinking about underlying congenital heart disease such as Tetralogy of Fallot. This case can be extended to discuss the importance of early diagnosis  contemplation of differential diagnoses  and a thorough discussion on the management approach for such patients.
13,10,88,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial88,Patient Profile: The patient is a two-month-old female infant who was brought by her parents to the pediatrician. They live in a suburban area and have no family history of congenital heart disease. The parents first noticed something was amiss due to the infant's lethargy and difficulty with feeding.  Past Medical History: The baby was born full-term via normal vaginal delivery with no abnormalities noted at birth or during neonatal period. She had regular prenatal checkups and screenings  all of which were unremarkable. There were no signs of fetal distress  birth asphyxia  or any signs of illness during infancy. There is no family history of congenital heart diseases or other genetic conditions. Both parents are non-smokers and the mother did not consume alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.  Key Complaints: The infant's parents report that she appears somewhat cyanotic  particularly during feeding. She also tires easily and seems to have difficulty sustaining a normal feeding routine. The parents have also observed her breathing is quite rapid  leading them to suspect a respiratory issue. Lastly  they reported her to have had several episodes of sweating and they also mentioned that the baby has not been gaining weight as expected for her age.  This case points to potential Congenital Heart Disease  possibly a Cyanotic Congenital Heart Defect. The baby's symptoms: cyanosis that worsens during feeding  easy fatiguability  rapid breathing  sweating  and poor weight gain are indicative of this. The next logical step in this case would be a thorough clinical examination and performing diagnostic tests such as Chest X-ray  EKG  and Echocardiography.
13,10,89,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial89,Patient Profile: Name: Samuel Johnson Age: 6 months Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Presenting Complaints: Poor feeding  rapid breathing  failure to gain weight   Past Medical History:  Samuel was born full-term via vaginal delivery with no complications. His prenatal scans were all reported normal. His parents have no significant medical history. His mother received regular prenatal care. His vaccinations are up-to-date as per CDC's infant immunization schedule. However  his parents have noticed that he hasn’t been gaining weight properly as per infant growth chart and often seems very tired.   Case Presentation: The baby's parents have noticed some abnormal symptoms over the past two months. Samuel often breathes rapidly  especially during feeding times  and he's had difficulty feeding or often becomes sweaty during feeds. Samuel has failed to gain weight adequately despite a good intake of food. He also tires quickly compared to other babies of his age. He also tends to sweat more than other infants in moderate temperatures.  Discussion: The key complaints in the case highlight significant signs of congenital heart disease  specifically pointing towards possible ventricular septal defect  atrial septal defect  or potentially coarctation of the aorta. These symptoms should prompt a thorough physical examination  including careful auscultation of heart sounds  blood pressure assessment  chest X-ray  electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram  to assess for structural heart abnormalities. Appropriate management should then be discussed based on the identified pathology  including potential medical and surgical interventions.  Learning Objectives: 1. Recognize the clinical signs and symptoms of pediatric congenital heart disease. 2. Understand the appropriate diagnostic workup for infants suspected to have congenital heart disease. 3. Understand the general treatment strategies for different types of congenital heart disease.
13,10,90,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial90,Patient Profile: Patient's Name: Baby Smith Age: 6 months Sex: Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Residence: Urban  Past Medical History: Baby Smith was born full term with no complications during delivery. The patient's mother had regular prenatal care and no reported use of drugs  alcohol  or tobacco during pregnancy. The familial history reveals no known history of congenital heart disease.  Presenting Complaints: Baby Smith's parents bring him to pediatric care owing to concerns about his feeding habits and frequent breathlessness compared to other babies of his age. According to his parents  Baby Smith appears irritable and less active  struggles during feedings  and suffers from recurrent chest infections. They also notice that his skin occasionally turns bluish  especially around his lips and fingernails. Although his growth has been regular  Baby Smith has not gained as much weight as expected in recent months.  Upon initial examination  the pediatrician noted a heart murmur during auscultation and suspected congenital heart disease as a possible cause of Baby Smith's symptoms. Further investigation involving echocardiogram and chest X-ray have been recommended to confirm the diagnosis.   The main learning objectives for medical students in this case are to recognize the common signs and symptoms of congenital heart disease in infants and to understand how to confirm the diagnosis using appropriate diagnostic tests.  Upon confirmation of diagnosis  the management  and treatment of congenital heart diseases is tailored based on the specific type of heart defect present  the age of the baby  the baby's general health  and other relevant factors. Therefore  it's crucial for medical students to learn about various types of heart defects  potential complications  and treatment options.
13,10,91,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial91,Case Report: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Information: Patient initials: JW Gender: Male Age: 5 years old Race: Caucasian Religion: Christianity Environmental factors: No known exposure to environmental toxins Family history: Mother has a history of rheumatic heart disease.  Past Medical History:  JW has been generally healthy with regular pediatric checkups  meeting all developmental milestones. His prenatal and perinatal history was unremarkable  except for a murmur noted by the pediatrician at birth. He was diagnosed with a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) during neonatal screening  kept under observation but has remained asymptomatic until recently. He has no history of surgical interventions  no known allergies  and has an up-to-date immunization status. No other history of heart disease in the family  and no history of substance abuse in the mother during pregnancy.  Key complaints:  JW's mother has brought him to the clinic with complaints of easy fatigue and shortness of breath after physical activity. She also mentions intermittent episodes of rapid breathing and poor weight gain. She also reports that JW has always been smaller than his peers and seems to be increasingly tired after his preschool activities. He also seems to sweat more compared to his peers during these activities.   Physical examination showed the following:   Weight: 16kg (Below 5th percentile for his age) Height: 105 cm (25th percentile for his age) Blood pressure: 90/60 mmHg Heart rate: Tachycardic at 110 bpm Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute  Upon further examination  a loud harsh holosystolic murmur was noted at the left lower sternal border  with no other abnormal heart sounds. Chest X-ray shows increased cardiac silhouette and an EKG has been scheduled to confirm the diagnosis.   We suspect JW's symptoms may be due to his VSD and potential resultant heart failure  thus further investigations have been planned to confirm the final diagnosis and develop a treatment plan.
13,10,92,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial92,Case Report:  Patient Overview: The patient is a 5-year-old Caucasian male. His weight is in the 40th percentile for his age and height is in the 45th percentile. The concerned parties are the patient’s parents  who are actively engaged and responsive.  Past Medical and Family History: The patient has been generally healthy with routine pediatric care and immunizations up to date. No known drug allergies or prior surgeries were reported. There were no major illness episodes except occasional mild fevers and colds treated by over-the-counter meds. Parents denied a family history of any known heart disease. Prenatal development was normal without reported complications or infections  and the baby was full-term with an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. The mother reported no alcohol  smoking  or drug use during pregnancy.  Presenting Complaints: The parents bring the child in due to concerns regarding his decreased activity levels and stunted growth when compared to his peers. They report that the child often becomes breathless after only a minimal amount of activity  also sometimes complaining about general fatigue and occasional episodes of rapid heartbeat. They have also noticed a blue-ish coloration around his lips and under his fingernails after physical activities.  Developmental History: Despite the stunted physical growth when compared to his peers  from a developmental perspective  the child otherwise appears to be at age-appropriate functioning levels. He is interactive  engages in play  and displays expected cognitive abilities for his age.  This case seeks to engage medical students in exploring a differential diagnosis of the child's symptoms  leaning towards Congenital Heart Disease as a primary possibility due to telltale signs  such as fatigue  breathlessness  rapid heartbeat  stunted growth  and cyanosis. An appropriate further assessment is needed to confirm the diagnosis  such as echocardiogram or other imaging  and relevant laboratory tests. Identifying the exact type of CHD  potential treatments  and long-term recommendations would follow.
13,10,93,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial93,Patient Profile: The patient is a 6-month-old Caucasian male  born from a non-consanguineous marriage and hails from urban Detroit.   Past Medical History: The patient was born after 38 weeks of gestation via normal vaginal delivery. The prenatal period was unremarkable  but the mother reported prescribed use of anti-depression medications during the first trimester. The infant experienced mild cyanosis and a heart murmur soon after birth  but these symptoms were not adequately investigated due to financial constraints. The infant was immunized according to CDC's immunization schedule. The infant's growth parameters have been somewhat below the 50th percentile since birth.  Presenting Complaints: The infant presents to the Pediatric Cardiology Clinic with chief complaints of poor weight gain  cyanosis with feeding and crying  and increased difficulty in breathing  which have been progressively worsening over the past two months. Additionally  the mother reported that her child tires easily during feedings and has less energy than other infants of his age.   Physical Examination Observation: On examination  the infant weighs 5 kg (below the 5th percentile for age). His pulse rate is 102 beats/min  and his respiratory rate is 36 breaths/min. A bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes is evident  more pronounced on the lips and fingertips (cyanosis). There is a palpable parasternal heave and a grade 3/6 pansystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border.   These preliminary details set the stage for the students to conduct a thorough analysis and rule out the possible congenital heart diseases  focusing on clinical features  diagnostic methods  management  and potential complications.

13,10,95,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial95,Patient Profile: Name: James Martinez Sex: Male Age: 3 years old Race: Hispanic Demographic Location: Urban area in New York  USA  Past Medial History:  Natal history  including prenatal fetal ultrasound  was unremarkable. James was the first child born through normal vaginal delivery at full-term without any complication. Early developmental milestones appropriate for his age. Child immunization was up-to-date. No previous hospital admissions or serious illnesses. There is no significant family history of heart disease or genetic disorders.   Key Complaints: The child was brought to the clinic by his parents due to issues noted with James's growth and development. They reported that he appears to tire quickly and does not appear to have the physical stamina of other children his age. He often complains of feeling short of breath after physical activity  has rapid heartbeat  and has occasionally turned bluish around his mouth when crying excessively. He is slightly below the average weight and height for his age group.   Most importantly  the parents mentioned unusual incidents of excessive sweating  especially while feeding. James seems to be feeding less than usual  which they suspect could be related to his decrease in growth. They have also observed that he gets easily irritated and suffers from a persistent cough from time-to-time that does not respond to the general cough medicines.   This case for congenital heart disease (CHD) will allow the medical students to delve deeper into the signs  symptoms  diagnosis  and management of children with CHD. This will also help them understand the social and emotional impacts families might experience when their child has a lifelong heart condition such as CHD. It will further help them feel empathetic towards the families dealing with such diseases and shape them into more compassionate healthcare providers.

13,10,97,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial97,Case Study: Congital Heart Disease  Patient Information  Name: Luisa Martinez Age: 5-years-old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Hispanic Residence: Chicago  USA  Past Medical History: Luisa is a 5-year-old girl  born at 37 weeks gestation via normal vaginal delivery. Pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. Her family medical history is unremarkable  and there is no known history of congenital heart disease. Luisa regularly attended the recommended well-child visits where she received her childhood immunizations  though her pediatrician noted that her growth progress was inconsistent. Referral was made for further testing to rule out potential underlying medical conditions.  Presenting Complaint: In recent months  Luisa's parents report she frequently seems out of breath after playing  tiring more easily than her peers. They also annotate occasional bluish color around her lips and fingertips during her tired spells. Recently  she has had decreased appetite and has failed to gain weight consistently.   Primary Assessment: Initial assessment reveals an alert  anxious child  with slight cyanosis around her lips. She is smaller than average for her age. Vitals are: BP – 108/70 mmHg  Pulse – 120/min  Respiratory rate – 32/min  and Temperature – 98.6 F. Cardiac exam reveals a systolic murmur.  Provisional Diagnosis: Based on the findings  there's a high suspicion for Congenital Heart Disease  possibly Tetralogy of Fallot or similar complex conditions. Further diagnostic tests including ECG  chest X-ray  echocardiogram  and possibly cardiac MRI or catheterization are needed for confirmation.    Implications: Given the nature of congenital heart diseases  the case study provides an insight into the importance of recognizing symptoms and signs early on for appropriate and timely intervention. Proper understanding of Luisa's case would allow medical students to learn about the lifecycle management of pediatric patients with heart conditions  impact of such conditions on growth and development  potential complications  and available treatment strategies.
13,10,98,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial98,Patient Information:   Patient JW is a male  aged 7 months  of Asian descent  from a low-income immigrant family. He was seen in a local urban free clinic  which usually witnesses a high patient turnover. JW lives with his parents and 3 older siblings in a small apartment. His mother reports no prenatal substance abuse  adequate prenatal care  and uncomplicated  full-term  vaginal delivery. His father had untreated rheumatic heart disease.   Past Medical History:   At birth  JW was diagnosed with Down Syndrome. Other than that  the patient has no known allergies and has been generally healthy with regular immunizations as per his age. He had a routine well-child exam at 3 months and was diagnosed with a failure to thrive due to low percentile growth in both height and weight.  Key Complaints:  The mother reports that JW has been experiencing irregular breathing patterns  frequently appearing pale and blue around his lips and mouth after feedings with significant fatigue. She also noticed JW having problems during feeding  seeming to tire easily and sweating excessively. JW has not been gaining weight adequately  according to the mother's report.  Next  it may be beneficial to do a complete review of systems  including a cardiac exam  to narrow down the differential diagnosis. Regardless of the cause  poor weight gain in a young infant is a significant finding and warrants further investigation. Physical findings such as a heart murmur  cyanosis (blue or purple coloration of the skin)  shortness of breath  or feeding issues may suggest congenital heart disease. As Down Syndrome is associated with an increased risk of congenital heart disease  this should be explored as a potential etiology for JW's symptoms.
13,10,99,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial99,Patient Case:  Demographics: Patient: An infant named John Doe  1-month-old male. Parents: Mr. & Mrs. Doe  both around their early 30s. Ethnicity: Caucasian Residence: Urban environment  Past Medical History: Thorough ante-natal check-ups were completed. However  no anomalies were detected during the prenatal ultrasound scans. There is no family history of congenital heart diseases. The mother had a full-term normal vaginal delivery.   Key Complaints: On routine neonatal checkup  the pediatrician noticed a bluish coloration of the skin and lips (cyanosis). The parents also reported that the baby shows frequent episodes of rapid breathing (tachypnea) and poor feeding. Along with that  John Doe has not been gaining weight as would be expected (failure to thrive). He also seems to get tired very quickly  even during feedings.  Physical examination showed possible signs of heart failure  and a continuous machine-like heart murmur was heard upon auscultation. The pediatrician decided to refer for further evaluation suspecting Congenital Heart Disease. The proposed investigations would include a chest X-ray  an electrocardiogram (EKG)  and an echocardiogram.  Ultimately  this case report aims to highlight the signs and symptoms of congenital heart disease  as well as diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this common pediatric cardiac condition. The various types of congenital heart diseases  their incidence  origin  and pathogenesis will be discussed during this case study. Moreover  we will explore various diagnostic tools and treatment methods for congenital heart disease  including surgical and non-surgical options.  
13,10,100,diagnosis13-prompt10-trial100,Patient Profile:  Name: Baby Boy Jones Age: 6 months Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Location: Urban Midwest  Past Medical History:  The patient is a single  first-born child of a healthy 27-year old mother. Pregnancy was generally uneventful. Mom did not report any use of alcohol  cigarettes  or illicit substances during the pregnancy. The baby was delivered at full term with no prenatal or perinatal complications. Birth weight was appropriate for gestational age at 3.5 kilograms. The patient has been up to date with his routine immunizations and well-baby check-ups. While the family history does not include any congenital heart diseases  it does suggest diabetes and hypertension on the paternal side.  Key Complaints:  The past 4 weeks have seen Baby Jones increasingly tiring during feedings. The parents have noted a decrease in his usual activity level and frequent sweating. Recently  the baby has been displaying signs of rapid breathing and his parents have reported occasional bluish color on his lips and tongue  which becomes more pronounced during crying episodes. Moreover  the mother has expressed concern over the child's failure to gain weight despite recommended intake.  Physical Examination Findings:  Physical examination reveals an active  alert baby with the following vitals: heart rate- 152 beats per minute  respiratory rate- 35 breaths per minute  oxygen saturation- 89% on room air. Baby is underweight for his age with visible signs of poor weight gain. Upon inspection  there appears to be a slight bluish color on the lips and tongue. Auscultation of the heart unveils a loud holosystolic murmur heard best at the lower sternal border along with a diastolic rumble.  This case can be used by medical students to discuss a probable diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot  a common congenital heart disease  as manifested by dyspnea  cyanosis  poor weight gain and a heart murmur. They may formulate a differential diagnosis  propose appropriate tests and treatments.
