8,1,1,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial1,Title: A Case Presentation of Deep Vein Thrombosis:  Patient Profile: Patient's Initials: RT Age: 57 years old Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Law Clerk Resides: Austin  Texas  Presenting Complaint: RT came in presenting with left leg discomfort worsened over the past week. The symptoms included a continual throbbing and pain in his left calf  accompanied by swelling  redness  and warmth on the surface of the affected area.  Past Medical History: RT has a documented history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is currently under medication (lisinopril and atorvastatin  respectively). He underwent hip replacement surgery about three months ago. He also gave a history of a sedentary lifestyle involving prolonged periods of sitting due to his occupational demand to be desk-bound. There is no significant history of hereditary illnesses  malignancies  or any diagnostic cardiovascular diseases.   Social History: RT is currently a smoker who uses about a pack a week and has an ethanol intake of about 20 units per week.  Clinical Findings: On physical examination  his vitals are within normal ranges  however  he showed unilateral edema on the left lower limb  which is Class II in severity. The area is warm and erythematous. There is also slight tenderness to touch.  Conclusion: Considering RT’s clinical presentation  past medical history  and factors such as age  recent surgery and largely sedentary lifestyle  a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was proposed. Management plans and further diagnostic tests  including D-dimer  compression ultrasonography or venography  are considered to confirm the diagnosis and prompt treatment initiation. We planned to appraise Mr. RT about the importance of lifestyle changes and regular follow-ups to mitigate the future risk associated with DVT.
8,1,2,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial2,Patient Presentation:   I would like to present a case of a 69-year-old Caucasian female who has presented with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Demographic Information:   The patient resides in a local retirement community in Austin  Texas with her 72-year-old husband. She is a retired school teacher and an active member of her poetry group and church activities. She is a non-smoker  but admits to the occasional glass of wine with her dinner. She has a BMI of 26  indicating that she is slightly overweight.   Past Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension which she has been effectively managing with medication for fifteen years. About 10 years ago  she underwent a hysterectomy due to uterine fibroids and has since been on hormone replacement therapy. She also has a history of varicose veins which were treated with sclerotherapy five years ago. The patient does not have a personal or a family history of clotting disorders but admits to relatively sedentary lifestyle due to her aging knees.  Presenting complaint:  She attended the clinic with the key complaint of persistent pain in her left leg  along with swelling  redness  and warmth to touch over calf muscles  which have been present for the last few days. She is highly compliant with her hypertension medication  but reported a month-long trip to Europe last month involving prolonged periods of inactivity during travel.  Given her age  sedentary lifestyle  hormone replacement therapy  and recent long-haul trip  she seems to fall into a high-risk bracket for DVT. Aggressive diagnostic tests are indicated.   That concludes the presentation of our patient with DVT. For next steps  further investigations are required to confirm the diagnosis and to formulate an appropriate treatment plan.

8,1,4,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial4,Patient Presentation:  Ms. Juanita Rivera  a 62-year-old Hispanic female  presents with complaints of progressive left lower limb pain and swelling. It's localized around her calf and extends up to her thigh  which she first noticed about 6 days ago. She states the pain is a persistent ache. Over the past 3 days  she says her left leg has been feeling much warmer than the right one. She categorizes her pain as 7 out of 10 in severity.   Juanita is a retired school teacher  lives with her husband  and is a non-smoker. She mentions taking occasional alcoholic beverages during gatherings. Historically  she has been largely healthy  other than well-managed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus which she has had for the past 8 years  and is under control with Metformin. She underwent a hip replacement surgery right side 2 years ago with no post-operative complications.  Last month she took an international flight and has been less mobile than usual post-travel due to home quarantine measures. Her family history is notable for an elder sister who had a stroke at 65 and a mother who died of myocardial infarction at the age of 70. She denies any previous episodes of thrombosis or thrombophlebitis.   Taking her symptoms  physical exam  and history into account  further investigations were carried out and Ms. Rivera was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in her left lower leg. Ms. Rivera is currently stable but given the history and her risk factors we would recommend proper management and consistent monitoring to prevent possible complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary embolism.   In conclusion  in cases with a classic presentation such as Juanita's  deep vein thrombosis should always be in the differential when a patient presents with unilateral leg swelling and pain. It is a potentially serious condition that requires immediate management to prevent life-threatening complications.
8,1,5,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial5,Title: Clinical Presentation of Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Demographic Information: Patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Johnson. He is a pack-a-day smoker for 38 years  consumes moderate-to-heavy alcohol  and has a sedentary lifestyle. Mr. Johnson is retired; previously he worked in an office setting with minimal physical activity. He is divorced with two adult children and lives alone. Mr. Johnson's BMI is 31  indicating obesity. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disorders.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department complaining of progressive swelling  tenderness  and mild  dull pain in the left calf muscles that started a couple of days ago. He denies any trauma or injury to the affected area. Recently  he had taken a long car journey of 8 hours.  Physical Examination: Upon inspection  unilateral swelling is noticeable in the left lower limb. The patient exhibits Homan’s sign  i.e.  discomfort behind the knee or calf upon forced dorsiflexion of the foot  indicating a positive test result for deep vein thrombosis. His vitals show a blood pressure of 142/85 mmHg  with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute.  Past Medical History: Mr. Johnson has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type II diabetes mellitus  all of which are being managed with medication. He is on oral antihypertensives  statins for dyslipidemia  and metformin for diabetes control. Five years ago  he experienced a transient ischemic attack but recovered with medical management. There have been no reported incidences of bleeding disorders or genetic thrombophilias.  Conclusion: Given Mr. Johnson's lifestyle  history of prolonged immobilization  presence of multiple risk factors for venous thrombosis including obesity  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  diabetes  and family history  along with the classic symptoms  deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a prime consideration. He is currently stable and will undergo further diagnostic confirmations via Doppler ultrasound or venography. Treatment interventions will be decided based on the diagnostic results  with an inclination towards anticoagulants or thrombolytic therapy  accompanied by lifestyle modification counseling.
8,1,6,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial6,Slide 1: Patient Introduction  Patient initials: J.D  Age: 64 years old  Sex: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian Occupation: Retired accountant  leads a sedentary lifestyle  Slide 2: Presenting Complaint  J.D presents with a 3-day history of increased swelling and discomfort in his right lower leg. He reports the pain as being a steady ache  that becomes more pronounced when standing or moving. He also notes mild pitting edema in the ankle and calf area.   Slide 3: Medical History  J.D has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  which are both well-controlled on medication. He had a previous DVT in the same leg about five years ago after a long-haul flight. He was treated with anticoagulants for 6 months after that incident. He gave up smoking 10 years ago after being a 20 cigarettes-a-day smoker for 35 years. He is on a steady diet to control his cholesterol levels. No history of cancer  liver or renal disease. No family history of thrombosis or clotting disorders.  Slide 4: Recent History  One week ago  JD returned from a car trip across the country with minimal stops and prolonged sitting. His swelling started soon after his return. He reports no trauma or injuries to his legs during the trip.  Slide 5: Physical Examination  Clinical examination reveals a warm  swollen  and slightly red right calf and ankle in comparison to the left. A palpable cord exists along the path of the vein. Homan's sign is positive. Patient vitals are stable.  Slide 6: Initial Impression  Given J.D.’s history of previous DVT  recent prolonged immobilization during the road trip  and presentation of unilateral leg swelling  warmth  and pain  our initial impression is that J.D. likely has a recurrent Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  Slide 7: Plan  J.D will undergo a Doppler ultrasound to confirm our suspicion of DVT. If the DVT is confirmed  he will likely require a course of anticoagulant medication and will be advised to elevate his leg and use compression stockings. Further investigation regarding potential clotting disorders may also be needed considering his recurrent DVT incidents. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor his response to treatment.   End of Presentation.
8,1,7,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial7,Presentation on a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Demographics and Background:  Patient name: Mrs. Jane Doe Age: 70 years old Sex: Female Race: African American Occupation: Retired teacher Marital Status: Widowed Residence: Lives by herself in a two-story house in the suburban area.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Doe has a significant past medical history which includes instances of several diseases. She has been diagnosed with hypertension for over 15 years for which she is on medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily). She has Type II Diabetes Mellitus  controlled by diet and metformin 500mg twice a day. Mrs. Doe underwent a total knee replacement six months ago and has been receiving physiotherapy since then. No known allergies have been reported.  Family History:  Her father had coronary artery disease and passed away from a myocardial infarction at age 72. Her mother had a stroke and succumbed to the complications of it at age 78. One of her two brothers was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his early 60s.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mrs. Doe reports that she has been experiencing a painful swelling in her right calf for the past three days. The pain  she mentions  occasionally intensifies at night and it's been difficult to ambulate. She also reported that she has noticed a significant increase in the temperature of the affected area lately. She denies any chest pain  shortness of breath or coughing up blood.  Upon initial examination  her right calf appears to be tender  swollen and noticeably warmer compared to her left calf. Physical examination also revealed a noticeable redness in the skin around the calf area.  Given her symptoms  previous surgical episode and family history  she presents a likely case of deep vein thrombosis. She has been referred for a Doppler ultrasound for further evaluation and confirmation of diagnosis. If confirmed  the management plan would be likely include anticoagulant therapy  compression stockings and lifestyle modifications.   We will keep monitoring Mrs. Doe closely to ensure that the condition does not progress to a potentially life-threatening pulmonary embolism.
8,1,8,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial8,Patient Presentation:  Our patient today is a 62-year-old Caucasian male named James. James is a retiree who presented to our emergency department complaining of a persistent pain in his left leg  which he rated as an 8 on the pain scale. He also claimed the affected area was hot to the touch and appeared slightly reddish compared to his other leg. His symptoms began to appear about a week ago and have progressively become more intense. Accompanying this  he has been experiencing mild shortness of breath for the last two days  but did not think much of it until the pain in his leg became severe.  Looking at his medical history  James has a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia for which he is under medication. He is a former smoker  with a past smoking history of 30 pack-years. He quit smoking five years ago. He does not consume alcohol. James also has a sedentary lifestyle  with limited physical activity; he spends much of his time sitting or lying down.  Considering his age  medical history  and lifestyle factors combined with the reported symptoms  there is a possibility that he may be developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT). His lack of movement may have contributed to the formation of a blood clot in his leg. Also  his diabetes and hypertension might increase his risk of blood clot formation.  Further laboratory testing and imaging is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and to discuss possible treatment options. As he is also experiencing shortness of breath  it is advised to examine him for any signs of a possible pulmonary embolism as DVT and pulmonary embolism are part of the same disease spectrum called venous thromboembolism. Timely diagnosis and management will prevent significant morbidity and potential mortality.

8,1,10,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial10,Slide 1: Introduction We will be discussing the case of a patient who has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics Our patient  Mr. John Doe  is a 62-year-old Caucasian male. He is a retired bank executive  married with two adult children  and resides in the suburbs of Los Angeles. He is a non-smoker but occasionally consumes alcohol socially.  Slide 3: Medical History Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension  controlled with regular medication (Atenolol 50 mg). He also has well-managed type 2 diabetes mellitus (Metformin 500 mg  twice daily). He was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and initiated on Rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily five years ago. In terms of surgical history  he experienced an appendectomy at age 24.   Slide 4: Lifestyle and Habits The patient has a sedentary lifestyle  with mostly desk work during his professional life and minimal physical activity after retirement. He has a familial history of heart disease. His diet is moderately healthy with occasional indulgence in high-fat foods.  Slide 5: Current Presentation Mr. Doe presented to the ambulance with a sudden onset of pain  swelling  and redness in his right leg. The pain was localized to the calf muscle and was non-radiating. He also voiced a complaint of recent-onset shortness of breath.  Slide 6: Diagnostic Results Upon examination  the right calf was found to be visibly swollen  red  and warm to touch. Blood investigations revealed a high D-Dimer value. An ultrasound of the right lower leg veins confirmed the presence of a clot  corroborating the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis.  Slide 7: Risk Assessment Given Mr. Doe's age  sedentary lifestyle  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes  his risk profile for cardiovascular disease  including DVT  is high. Additionally  he recently underwent a long flight after his visit to Europe  which may have been a precipitating factor for DVT.  Slide 8: Plan of Action The patient was admitted and started on anticoagulation therapy. A consultation with a cardiologist is scheduled to assess his cardiovascular risks further and modify his lifestyle and treatment plan accordingly. Regular follow-ups are planned to monitor his response to the treatment.
8,1,11,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial11,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis   Case Study: The patient  Mr. John Doe  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presented with complaints of a swollen  reddish  and warm right calf for the last 3 days. He states the swelling developed gradually  with mild intermittent pain that significantly worsened over the past day. He presently rates the pain as 7 out of 10 in intensity. The patient denies trauma or injury to the leg  fever  shortness of breath  or chest pain.  Demographic Data: Mr. Doe is a retired bank manager  a widower  and resides alone. He is a smoker with a 20-pack year history and maintains a moderate alcohol consumption. He admits to leading a sedentary lifestyle since his retirement 3 years ago. He has no known drug allergies.   Past Medical History: The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  diagnosed 15 years back. Mr. Doe has been on Metformin 1000 mg twice a day and Enalapril 10 mg once daily. The patient underwent an appendectomy 20 years ago. However  he has no previous history of any thromboembolic diseases.   Family History:  There is a family history of cardiovascular disease; Mr. Doe's father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 50  and his elder brother died of stroke at the age of 69.   Risk Assessment: Given the patient’s history of hypertension  diabetes  long-term smoking  and family history of cardiovascular diseases -which all increase the risk of clot formation-  along with the patient's sedentary lifestyle  Mr. Doe is at high risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Based on the presentation and clinical suspicion of DVT  further diagnostic studies including D-dimer test and duplex ultrasonography of the affected limb were ordered. Patient education also took place  with emphasis on the risks of smoking  importance of exercise and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.   The presentation is important to understand the risk factors and presentation of deep vein thrombosis. It also highlights the urgent need for examination and prompt treatment to prevent complications such as pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome.
8,1,12,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial12,Slide 1: Introduction  Patient Profile:  Mr. John Smith  a 65 year old Caucasian male  a retired construction worker  resides in San Francisco  USA. He has been a smoker for the past 40 years and falls into a high BMI category with values ranging between 30-35 over the last decade.   Slide 2: Presenting Symptoms   Mr. Smith presented with symptoms such as persistent pain and swelling in the right lower leg that has worsened over a period of 10 days. The symptomatic leg also seems to be warmer than the other and displays superficial venous dilation.   Slide 3: Past Medical History   Mr. Smith's medical history includes uncontrolled type II diabetes for the last 15 years. He is also a known hypertensive patient since the age of 55 and had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. Other past surgical history includes hip replacement surgery done 3 months ago. His medication list includes insulin  aspirin  beta-blockers  and statins. The patient has also previously been non-compliant to anticoagulation therapy during post operative period.  Slide 4: Evaluation Conclusion   Given his medical history and current symptoms  a preliminary evaluation suggests a likelihood of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).   Slide 5: Next Steps  To confirm the diagnosis  we will proceed with further diagnostic procedures  including a D-Dimer test and Doppler ultrasound on the symptomatic leg. A plan for treatment and monitoring will be established according to the diagnostic findings. This may include initiating anticoagulation therapy  using graduated compression stockings  and encouraging lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation  weight loss  and increased physical activity.   Slide 6: Patient Follow-up   We intend to follow up with Mr. Smith weekly in the early stages of diagnosis  then monthly upon stabilization. Intervals may be adjusted based on the evaluation of his clinical response to the prescribed treatments.   Slide 7: Conclusion   Mr. Smith's DVT could potentially be a result of his recent surgery  sedentary lifestyle  obesity and non-compliance to post operative anticoagulation therapy. Treating him requires a comprehensive and durable approach that considers these risk factors. At the same time  his chronic conditions of diabetes and hypertension need to be well managed.   Slide 8: Questions  We are open to any questions or suggestions regarding the proposed diagnostic approach  treatment plan or follow-up schedule. We welcome any input that could facilitate better health outcomes for Mr. Smith.
8,1,13,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial13,Title: Presentation of a patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Introduction:   We are presenting the case of a 65-year-old African American male patient referred to our vascular department with an initial diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient has a past medical history which is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and a recent knee replacement surgery.  Identifying Data: This patient is a retired high school teacher living in a suburban area with his spouse. The patient is a non-smoker but admits to consuming alcohol socially.   Medical History:  The patient has a known history of type 2 diabetes  which was diagnosed 15 years ago and is managed with oral hypoglycemic drugs. The patient also has a history of hypertension for the past ten years  pharmacologically managed with ACE inhibitors. Additionally  he underwent right knee replacement surgery four weeks ago.  Clinical Presentation:  The patient reported a one-week history of progressive pain and swelling of the right lower extremity  which was initially thought to be post-surgical swelling. Upon further examination  the calf was warm to touch  swollen  with a positive Homans’ sign  suggestive of deep vein thrombosis. No signs of superficial vein thrombosis nor skin ulceration were noticed.  Investigation:  The preliminary diagnosis of DVT was confirmed by a Doppler ultrasound which showed a blood clot in the femoral vein. A baseline blood test revealed a slightly elevated D-dimer level.   In conclusion  this case exemplifies a typical presentation of DVT in a patient with several risk factors including age  recent surgery  hypertension  and diabetes. Immediate anticoagulant therapy was initiated to prevent possible fatal complications such as pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation and management were also planned  including risk factor modification  to prevent the recurrence of DVT.
8,1,14,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial14,Title: A Case Presentation of Deep Vein Thrombosis  Demographic Information: Patient’s Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 62 yrs Gender: Male Occupation: Retired Bank Manager  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Residence: Chicago  Illinois  Presenting condition:  Mr. Doe reports experiencing progressive pain and swelling localized in the left lower limb for the past week. He also described the skin over the calf region as warm and slightly discolored - a dark  reddish-blue.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe is a known case of Type II Diabetes Mellitus for the last 10 years  currently under oral hypoglycemic medication. He also has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His BMI falls into the category of obesity  with a body mass index of 30.7. He underwent a total knee replacement surgery on his left knee 3 years ago. The patient has a 40 pack-year history of tobacco use but quit smoking 2 yrs ago after his physician advised him to quit due to his COPD diagnosis. He admits to consuming alcohol occasionally.  Family History: Both parents deceased  father passed away due to a stroke at the age of 70  mother succumbed to breast cancer at 68. Patient revealed that swelled veins run in his family  his mother and grandmother both had varicose veins.  Social History: Mr. Doe leads an introverted sedentary life as a retiree. Though he understands the importance of physical activity  he admits that he rarely partakes  due to persistent pain and shortness of breath during exertion.  Review of Systems: Patient has been experiencing sporadic chest pain for the last few days  no evidence of hemoptysis. He denies experiencing any recent trauma to the leg.  Impression: Given Mr Doe's age  history of joint surgery  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and the presence of genetic predisposition  the symptoms indicate the probable diagnosis of DVT.  Plan: Order an ultrasound of the lower limb to confirm DVT. Consider initiating anticoagulation therapy while we await results. Refer him to a dietitian to help mitigate the risk factors of obesity. Strongly recommend an increased level of physical activities and refer to the physiotherapist.
8,1,15,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial15,Patient Presentation  Today  I will be presenting a case of a 67-year-old Caucasian female patient  Mrs. Anne Thompson  who has come complaining of a one-week history of swelling  tenderness and redness in her lower right leg. Mrs. Thompson is a retired teacher  lives with her husband in the outskirts of Seattle  is moderately active and is handicapped due to. She indicates the symptoms as a persistent dull ache  which is worse on standing or walking  and relieved somewhat by elevating the leg.  Regarding her past medical history  she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10 years ago  for which she is managing with Metformin and lifestyle changes. She also has hypertension  which is controlled with Lisinopril. She is obese with a BMI of 32. She underwent a total knee replacement surgery on her right knee 4 months ago and has been in physiotherapy since then. She has had no previous episodes of venous thromboembolism. She is a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago  and consumes alcohol socially.  Various risk factors identified are her recent surgical history  obesity  diabetes  and reduced mobility. There are no reported allergies  and she is not currently on any anticoagulation therapy. The patient's family history revealed that her father had a stroke at the age of 68 and her sister suffered from pulmonary embolism at 60.  Physical examination showed a swollen  erythematous and warm right lower leg. There was tenderness along the line of the right femoral vein. She also has a palpable cord along the distribution of the right long saphenous vein. The symptoms are suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). For confirmation  we recommend a Doppler ultrasound and D-dimer test.   In presenting this case  I aim to emphasize the importance of being proactive in preventing possible complications related to DVT in individuals with key risk factors  which can significantly impact patients' quality of life and survival.

8,1,23,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial23,Title: Presentation on Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Profile:  I present to you Mr. Timothy Blake  a Caucasian male  68 years old  retired railway engineer  currently residing in San Francisco  California. He is a lifelong non-smoker  and his alcohol consumption is moderate. He has no history of illicit drug usage.  Past Medical Background:  Mr. Blake has a significant past medical history of medical conditions  including hypertension  Type II Diabetes Mellitus  and ischemic heart disease. His hypertension and diabetes are relatively well-controlled with a regimen of Metformin and Lisinopril. He experienced a myocardial infarction 6 years ago but responded well to treatment and rehabilitation.  Current Presentation:  Presently  Mr. Blake presents with increased swelling  warmth  and tenderness in the right lower leg  symptoms that began roughly five days ago and have progressively worsened. The pain heightens when standing or walking. He denies any recent trauma or injuries but did go on a long-distance flight to visit family two weeks ago. He also reveals experiencing sporadic shortness of breath.  Examinations & Investigations:  On physical examination  notable right leg swelling  erythema  and warmth were observed compared to the left leg  suggestive of a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Mr. Blake’s vital signs remained fairly stable with a breathing rate of 20 breaths per minute and a heart rate of 80 beats per minute. The healthcare providers have ordered a Doppler ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the clot.  Risk Factors:  Given Mr. Blake's recent lengthy flight travel  his sedentary lifestyle due to retirement  his pre-existing hypertension  and diabetes  his risk for developing DVT is significantly increased. Additionally  his past myocardial infarction indicates an underlying cardiovascular disease  adding another risk factor.  Management & Factors to Consider:  Upon confirmation  Mr. Blake may require anticoagulant therapy  potential clot removal or filters dependent on the size and location of the DVT clot. We'd also recommend a plan to reduce his risk factors such as light regular exercise  and properly managed hydration  especially during travel or periods of inactivity. His diabetic and hypertensive state also necessitates special attention when devising a treatment plan. His family has been informed and educated about DVT and its potential complications  like Pulmonary Embolism.   This clinical case proposes a comprehensive  patient-centric multidisciplinary approach to optimally manage Mr. Blake's case  while reducing his risk of common complications associated with DVT.

8,1,26,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial26,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Introduction:   We are presenting a case of a 65-year-old Caucasian female who has been diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis.   Demographic information:   The patient is a retired school teacher  living in rural Montana  USA  and non-smoker. She drinks occasionally and has never used drugs. She lives with her husband and has two grown-up children. She maintains moderate physical activity through gardening and daily walks. She is generally consistent with recommended screenings and medical appointments and is up-to-date with her immunizations.   Medical History:  The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus which are both well-controlled with medications (lisinopril and metformin respectively). She also has a history of hyperlipidemia controlled by a statin-atorvastatin. About 5 years ago  she had an uncomplicated hysterectomy due to uterine fibroids.   The patient's family history reveals her mother had a stroke in her late 70's and her father had coronary artery disease. There are no known genetic disorders in her family.  Presenting Complaint:  In the last week  the patient has been complaining of progressive pain in her left lower extremity  associated with swelling  redness  and warmth which compromises her daily activities. She reports no recent trauma and denies any respiratory symptoms like difficulty in breathing or chest pain. She also denies symptoms suggestive of superficial vein thrombosis such as skin discoloration or venous palpability.   Her vital signs on arrival were within normal limits except for slightly elevated blood pressure. On physical examination  her left calf appeared slightly swollen and erythematous compared to her right calf.   Impression:  Given the patient's age  associated risk factors like a personal history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia  a clinical diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis is considered. Further investigations including D-dimer test and duplex ultrasonography are planned to confirm the diagnosis.   The patient's medications are being reviewed  and upon confirmation of DVT  anticoagulant therapy will be initiated. An individual plan will be made to ensure long-term management of DVT and its associated risk factors. Patient education regarding signs and symptoms of possible complications like a pulmonary embolism will also be prioritized. The importance of lifestyle changes to reduce DVT risk will also be part of her management plan. 
8,1,27,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial27,Title: Patient Presentation with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Profile: Our patient is a 66-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. John Doe  who resides in the suburbs of New York. Mr. Doe is retired but previously worked as an office manager. His body mass index (BMI) is 28.6  indicating overweight. He is a past smoker  having quite the habit 15 years ago. He consumes alcohol moderately and does not engage in any regular physical exercise.  Medical Background: Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus for which he is being treated with Lisinopril and Metformin. Furthermore  he had a myocardial infarction 3 years ago and since has been on Aspirin and Atorvastatin. He is also being investigated for a possible sleep apnea after he reported frequent daytime fatigue to his GP.   Presenting Issue: Mr. John Doe has come to the Emergency Department presenting with severe  unilateral leg pain and swelling in his left leg. The leg also feels warm to the touch and appears to be reddish-blue in color. He states the symptoms occurred suddenly and have been worsening in severity over the past three days.   He was on a return flight from Australia when he initially noticed mild discomfort in his left lower leg  which has progressively gotten worse. He also noted that the leg swelling seems to increase after long periods of sitting or standing.  Preliminary Diagnosis: Clinical symptoms suggest the possibility of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). This diagnosis is largely based on his recent long-distance travel involving prolonged sitting and his risk factors such as age  BMI and underlying comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. A definitive diagnosis would require further tests such as a Doppler Ultrasound study.   Potential Treatment: Initial management would include anticoagulants to prevent further clot formation and to prevent the existing clot from traveling to the lungs which can cause pulmonary embolism - a life-threatening condition. Further plans for long-term prevention of DVT  such as lifestyle modifications and compression stockings  should be considered if the diagnosis is confirmed.   Concluding Remarks: Mr. Doe's case underlines the importance of recognizing the risk factors for Deep Vein Thrombosis and initiating prompt treatment and management. A multidisciplinary approach that involves cardiology  endocrinology  and potentially  pulmonology specialists will be necessary for comprehensive care.

She reports having experienced these symptoms for approximately 4 to 5 days and notes no improvement.  Medical History: Ms. Benton is a known patient with obesity (BMI: 32) and hypertension. She has been taking anti-hypertensive medication for the last six years and reports occasional lapses in her routine. She underwent a total knee replacement surgery in her left knee two months ago and was bedridden for a considerable period during her recovery. Ms. Benton was on prophylactic anticoagulant therapy post-surgery for three weeks. She has been a smoker for over 25 years. No known allergies have been reported.  Family History: Ms. Benton's father suffered from coronary artery disease  and her mother had deep vein thrombosis. Both her parents had hypertension. She has no siblings.   Social History: She lives alone and is a widow with two adult children who live out of state. Ms. Benton was a school administrator till her retirement two years ago. She is still an active smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She reports a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity.  Given her presenting symptoms and medical history  a Doppler ultrasound was conducted revealing a blood clot in the deep veins of her left calf  confirming the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis.   Because of her known risk factors such as recent surgery  immobilization  obesity  hypertension  smoking  and family history of DVT  she falls under a considerable risk category for venous thromboembolism. The next steps for her would involve confirming the size and exact location of the clot  assessing the risk of pulmonary embolism  and establishing an optimal treatment plan which might include anticoagulant therapy. As she is at risk  a lifestyle change might also be recommended to her.

He doesn't smoke  but he has a history of moderate alcohol consumption.   Relevant past medical history reveals that Mr. Smith suffers from type 2 diabetes  for which he has been on metformin for the past 10 years. He has been controlling his diabetes relatively well with oral hypoglycemic agents and diet. He also has hypertension  which has been managed with amlodipine for the last five years. His blood pressure on his last visit 2 months ago was 130/80 mmHg.   Mr. Smith had undergone a left total hip replacement surgery five years ago  however  no complications or thrombotic events were reported post-surgery. He also had a history of pulmonary embolism seven years ago.  Upon examination  he was found to have significant pain  warmth  and swelling in the calf area of his left leg  a finding consistent with deep vein thrombosis. His vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 128/82 mmHg  heart rate of 78 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute  and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.   An ultrasound with Doppler confirmed the presence of an occlusive thrombus in the left calf was performed confirming deep vein thrombosis.   The combination of his lifestyle  pre-existing medical conditions  and previous history of thrombotic events have put him at a high risk of developing DVT. Moving forward  the plan is to initiate anticoagulation therapy and closely monitor his progress  while also emphasizing the importance of regular physical activity to prevent the occurrence of such events in the future.
8,1,35,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial35,Title: Case Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient's Profile: The patient is a 57-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith. He works as an accountant  and lives with his wife in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol only occasionally.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith presented to the emergency department complaining of acute onset  significant pain  swelling and redness in his left leg  primarily in the calf region. The pain appeared suddenly  is getting progressively worse and is now preventing him from walking comfortably.   Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He had a myocardial infarction three years ago. He also reported that he has been less mobile for the past week due to a work project deadline. He mentions a family history of stroke in his mother. His regular medications include Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.  Surgical History: Mr. Smith underwent an appendectomy at 25 years of age and has no other surgical histories.  Social History: He is married  has 2 adult children  and leads a sedentary lifestyle due to his desk job. He is not involved in routine physical exercise. Mr. Smith denies tobacco  excessive alcohol use  or illicit drug use.   Allergies: The patient has a documented allergy to penicillins  where he develops a rash.  Investigations: A clinical examination reveals a swollen  erythematous left leg. The leg circumference was measured to be larger compared to the right. A D-Dimer test was conducted which came back high. A subsequent Doppler ultrasound carried out confirmed the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis in the left leg.  This case of deep vein thrombosis in Mr. Smith may be attributed to his recent reduced mobility due to work demand  in addition to his already existing risk factors including age  a sedentary lifestyle  hypertension  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and his personal history of coronary artery disease. Therefore  immediate intervention and lifestyle modification advice is required.   References: None.
8,1,36,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial36,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 70-year-old African American male who presents to the clinic today complaining of progressive severe pain and swelling in the left leg for a period of one week. The patient describes the pain as constant and is associated with a dull aching sensation. He also notes that the skin over the area is warmer to touch and visibly red.  Demographics:  Mr. Smith is a retired mechanical engineer who lives with his wife and has a family history of heart disease. He is a former smoker and obesity and indulges occasional alcohol consumption. His physical activity is limited due to his current state of pain and discomfort.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Smith has a known history of hypertension and type II diabetes managed with losartan 50mg daily  and metformin 500mg twice a day  respectively. He underwent a right hip replacement three years ago due to advanced osteoarthritis. The surgery was uneventful  but he did experience some shortness of breath post-surgery. He had a TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack) about five years ago  from which he recovered completely with no residual deficits. He has no known allergies.  Social History: Mr. Smith has been married for 47 years and has 3 adult children. He quit smoking 10 years back after smoking a pack a day for 30 years. His diet includes controlled sugar and salt intake  but he mentions struggling to limit his food portions  leading to persistent obesity.   The aspect of his limited mobility  personal and family history of cardiovascular events  and co-existing conditions point out the possibility of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Therefore  further investigations  including blood tests  ultrasound imaging  are planned to confirm the diagnosis and manage treatment accordingly.
8,1,37,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial37,Title: Patient Presentation - Deep Vein Thrombosis  Introduction: Today I will be presenting a 65-year-old Caucasian male patient  Mr. John Smith  referred to our facility. His primary complaint is a swelling  warmth  and redness in his left leg  which has worsened over the last 48 hours. He also describes the onset of intermittent left lower leg pain  particularly during walking  during the previous week.   Demographic Information: Mr. Smith lives in Madison  Wisconsin  with his wife. He is a retired teacher and admits to spending much of his day seated. He has a BMI of 28.0 kg/m2 indicative of overweight. His only family history of concern includes a brother who suffered a pulmonary embolism at the age of 72. He is a smoker of about 10 cigarettes per day for 30 years and consumes alcohol socially. He denied illicit drug use.  Medical History: Mr. Smith had hypertension diagnosed a decade ago  for which he has been prescribed 5mg of Amlodipine. Five years ago  he underwent arthroscopy of the left knee following a sport's injury. He recovered well  and there were no postoperative complications. He has no known allergies. Other common medical conditions  such as diabetes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  and coronary artery disease  are absent in his history.  Clinical Examination: Upon physical examination  Mr. Smith's left leg demonstrated an observable and palpable swelling. The skin over the area was warm compared to the other extremity  and it exhibited a blush-red discoloration. No ulcer formations or varicose veins were noted. Peripheral pulses in the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries were evenly bilaterally present.  Laboratory: His complete blood count and biochemistry profile were normal. His fasting lipid panel was within range  and he is not diabetic. Coagulation parameters have been sent considering the high suspicion of venous thromboembolism.  Clinical impression: Given the consistent symptom profile  Mr. John Smith is likely presenting with deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. Further evaluation with Doppler ultrasound imaging and perhaps D-dimer testing will be pursued. Pending these results  anticoagulation therapy might be initiated.   Conclusion: Presumptive deep vein thrombosis  the patient's risk factors including age  reduced mobility  the history of smoking  and the past surgical procedure  provide a convincing scenario. Ongoing management will entail hospitalization  thrombolytic therapy  and potentially prophylactic measures to prevent pulmonary embolism.

8,1,41,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial41,Presentation  Good morning everyone   Today  we are discussing the case of Mr. Robert Jones  a 65-year-old Caucasian male presenting with a diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  He is an ex-smoker with a 40 pack-year history  but quit smoking around 10 years ago. Mr. Jones is retired  previously worked as a truck driver  which necessitated long periods of inactivity. His BMI is 29.9  placing him in the class of being overweight. He is not a regular alcohol consumer  but admits to occasional consumption.  Mr. Jones has a significant past medical history which includes Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for the past 10 years. Due to his sedentary lifestyle and heavy smoking history  he was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 5 years ago.   Recently  he presented to our outpatient clinic with symptoms of pain  swelling and warmth in his left calf following a cross country flight. He admits of not moving around much during the flight. On examination  his left calf seemed slightly swollen and tender compared to his right. A Doppler ultrasound was conducted which showed a clot in the deep vein confirming DVT.   Now  our focus will be both on the immediate treatment of the current thrombosis and on considering secondary prevention measures  taking into account Mr. Jones's risk profile associated with his sedentary lifestyle  his past medical history of diabetes  PAD  COPD and his travel history.   That will be all for this patient presentation. Please proceed with any questions or comments.
8,1,42,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial42,Title: Patient Presentation - Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Details:  - Name: Mr. John Doe - Age: 58 Years Old - Gender: Male - Occupation: Office Worker - Ethnicity: Caucasian  Medical History:  - Hypertension: Diagnosed six years ago  being managed with medication (Lisinopril).  - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosed four years ago  managed with a healthy diet  Metformin  and regular exercise. - Prior Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Patient suffered from DVT five years ago  underwent treatment with therapeutic anticoagulation.  Presenting Complaints: The patient came to the emergency department complaining of acute  progressive pain  and swelling in his left calf  which has been ongoing for the past three days. He rates the pain as a 7 on a 1-10 scale and notes that it increases on walking.  On examination  the left calf measures 4 cm more in circumference than the right calf  and it's tender  warm  and erythematous. There are no signs of a palpable cord.  Given Mr. Doe's history of previous DVT  sedentary work environment  and the presence of other risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes  he is at high risk for a recurrent DVT.  Next Steps: A Duplex ultrasound of the left lower extremity is ordered for definitive diagnosis. If we confirm DVT  we will adjust his therapy  possibly with low-molecular-weight heparin initially  followed by long-term oral anticoagulation therapy. We must also reassess his lifestyle risk factors and advise accordingly to prevent recurrence.

Exposure history: He has no history of previous blood clots  injuries or travel. Due to COVID-19 restrictions  he has been mostly remaining indoors.  Assessment: Based on the patient's symptoms  medical history  recent major surgery  and limited mobility  there is a high suspicion for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). He will require further assessment with a Doppler ultrasound and D-dimer test. If confirmed  anticoagulation management would be initiated.  Note: This scenario is fictitious and has no relation to any real-life individuals or circumstances.
8,1,46,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial46,Title: Patient Presentation – Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Mr. John Thompson  a 63-year old Caucasian male  has presented with a suspected case of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). His primary complaints involve pain and swelling in his right calf which he noticed four days ago. The patient describes the pain as being constant and getting worse when standing. He also noticed redness and warmth over the painful area.  He is an electrician by trade and spends many hours per day on his feet. He is a nonsmoker and mentions that he does not engage in regular physical activity aside from his demanding job. He admits to moderate alcohol consumption  averaging around 10-15 units per week.  His past medical history is significant for hypertension  for which he takes bisoprolol 5mg daily. He also had an appendectomy at age 12 and a hernia repair at age 40. His mother had a history of a stroke  and his father died from a heart attack at age 75.  He denies any recent travel or periods of prolonged immobility and states he doesn't have any history of blood clot disorders in his family. He admits to situational stress but denies generalized anxiety or depressive symptoms.   This combination of prolonged periods of standing  moderate alcohol consumption  and a history of hypertension are potential risk factors contributing to Mr. Thompson's presentation. His age  gender  and hereditary factors (i.e.  family history of cardiovascular events) may also play a role in his risk for DVT.  Given the patient's presentation and past medical history  a thorough evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of his symptoms. If confirmed  initiating appropriate treatment for DVT including anti-coagulation therapy  lifestyle changes  and possible referral to a specialist will be the next steps.

He hails from Boston  Massachusetts and is a retired attorney. He lives with his wife and has three adult children. He is a non-smoker but admits to drinking alcohol moderately.  Mr. Smith came into the clinic concerned about a persisting pain and swelling in his right leg  especially in the calf area. In the past week  the symptoms have been amplified  accompanied by a slight fever and a warm touch over the area. Upon examination  the leg displays a red and somewhat bluish discoloration.   His past medical history indicates chronic hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both conditions controlled with medication - Losartan and Atorvastatin  respectively. He also underwent a total knee replacement surgery 5 months ago on his right knee  following which he reported being less physically active than usual due to recovery.   There is no family history of clotting disorders. However  he did mention that his father suffered from late-onset Type 2 diabetes.   Mr. Smith's symptoms suggest the possibility of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  possibly due to his recent knee surgery and a decrease in physical activity. Further diagnostic tests  including D-dimer Test  Duplex Ultrasound  or Venography  will be required to confirm the diagnosis.""""   Our team's immediate plan for Mr. Smith includes a prompt assessment of his DVT risk and possible initiation of anticoagulant medication  pending his diagnostic test outcomes. We will also need to educate him on measures to manage these symptoms  including elevating the leg and using compression stockings. His case could benefit from a multidisciplinary approach  with involvement from the primary care provider  vascular surgeon  and a physical therapist in future treatment decisions."

8,1,57,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial57,Presentation Title: A Case of Deep Vein Thrombosis   Slide 1: Patient Introduction Our patient is a 52-year-old Caucasian male by the name of Mr. Brown  currently residing in Houston  Texas. He works as a software programmer and lives a majority sedentary lifestyle. He is a former smoker and has a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Slide 2: Medical Background Mr. Brown has a past medical history notable for obesity  with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 33. He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus eight years ago and Hypertension five years ago. He has been managing these conditions with oral medication. However  his compliance with the prescribed medication and therapeutic lifestyle changes has been mediocre. Previous hospital admissions include an appendectomy twenty years ago. He does not have any known allergies.  Slide 3: Current Presentation Mr. Brown presented himself in the emergency room due to increasing pain and swelling in his left leg  which has been persistent over the past week. He also reported a recent prolonged period of sitting due to a software project deadline. He denies chest pain  shortness of breath  dizziness  or any other systemic symptoms.  Slide 4: Clinical Examination A physical examination revealed a warm  erythematous  and swollen left calf. His vitals were stable but his blood pressure was slightly elevated at 145/95 mmHg. His cardiovascular examination was normal  with no murmurs  rubs  or gallops. The rest of his examination was unremarkable.  Slide 5: Diagnosis and Management Given the clinical presentation and risk factors  a diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) was suspected. After an ultrasound confirmed the presence of DVT  Mr. Brown was started on anticoagulants. A patient education session was conducted to improve his medication compliance and lifestyle changes. He will also receive therapy to manage his weight  diabetes  and hypertension to reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT in the future.  Slide 6: Takeaway  Mr. Brown’s case emphasizes the pivotal role of lifestyle modification and vigilant management of chronic diseases  like diabetes and hypertension  in preventing complications such as DVT. It also shed light on the importance of early recognition and management of such conditions to thwart life-threatening situations.   Slide 7: References & Acknowledgement  We thank the team of doctors and nurses who provided care for Mr. Brown. We also extend our thanks to Mr. Brown for allowing his case to be shared for educational purposes.  
8,1,58,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial58,Patient Presentation:  I would like to introduce Mr. Robert Smith  a 65-year old Caucasian male with a primary complaint of swelling and pain in his right lower extremity. His symptoms started approximately 2 days ago and have been progressively worsening. Along with this  he also mentions that there is noticeable warmth and redness in the same area.  Before this  Mr. Smith has a past medical history significant for hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus  both of which are well managed with medications. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years back but had a 30-year history of half-a-pack cigarettes a day. He is not a known case of any hematological disorders  though he does express that he has been leading a sedentary lifestyle  especially since his retirement 5 years ago.   A month back  Mr. Smith had undergone an orthopedic surgery for a total hip replacement after a fall he had at his home  resultantly leading to restricted movements post-op. He neglects any history of similar symptoms in the past or any family history of blood clotting disorders.   There is no history of chest pain  shortness of breath  or hemoptysis. His medications include Lisinopril for hypertension and Metformin for his diabetes. He also reported occasional use of OTC Ibuprofen for arthritis pain.   Initial physical examination findings show the right calf circumference to be significantly larger than the left  with a tenderness along the line of the deep venous system. His vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg  heart rate of 82 bpm  temperature at 98.7°F  and with an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.  Given his recent surgery  the nature of the symptoms  and his mostly sedentary lifestyle  there is a high suspicion of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Further diagnostic tests including a D-dimer assay and venous Doppler ultrasonography of the lower limb will be conducted for confirmation.  Additionally  an assessment for pulmonary embolism will also be considered due to the potential risk in a DVT patient. For immediate medical plan  we are considering starting anticoagulation therapy.
8,1,59,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial59,Slide 1: Introduction Our patient for today's presentation is a 68-year-old male of Caucasian descent named Mr. Smith who presented with deep vein thrombosis.  Slide 2: History of Present Illness Mr. Smith has a progressive history of experiencing unusual leg pain and swelling in his right calf over the past 72 hours. The pain was initially intermittent and mild  but has progressively become more constant and severe. He also reported increased warmness of his right calf and notable redness.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Mr. Smith is a retired coal miner who has been previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension. He suffered a mild stroke four years ago. His medications include Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Simvastatin for hyperlipidemia.  Slide 4: Social History  Mr. Smith is a former smoker  he quit 10 years ago after smoking a packet a day for 40 years. He is a moderate alcohol drinker  consuming average of one to two glasses of wine daily. He lives with his wife and leads a somewhat sedentary lifestyle.   Slide 5: Familial History  His family history includes a father who died of a heart attack at age 73  and a mother who died at 80 with unspecified dementia. His younger brother had a Pulmonary Embolism at the age of 66.  Slide 6: Assessment  Based on his symptoms  history of prolonged inactivity  familial history  and his past medical history – specifically his age  history of stroke and hyperlipidemia is at high-risk for deep vein thrombosis.  Slide 7: Summary In summary  Mr. Smith is a 68-year-old man with a significant history predisposing him to deep vein thrombosis and higher-risk prognosis due to his history of cardiovascular diseases. The recent development of constant and severe leg pain along with swelling in his right calf suggests complications  possibly a deep vein thrombosis.  Next steps would involve laboratory investigations  ultrasound  and if confirmed  appropriate treatment involving anticoagulants  lifestyle changes  and possibly thrombectomy to prevent further complications such as pulmonary embolism. Further patient and caregiver education about disease management and prevention will also be a crucial step.
8,1,60,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial60,Title: Presentation of a Case of Deep Vein Thrombosis  Introduction: We bring to you a case of a 68-year-old Caucasian female patient presenting symptoms indicative of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  Contextual Identification: The patient  Mrs. Bonnie Thompson  resides in Augusta  Georgia  living an independent and mostly sedentary lifestyle. She is retired  widowed  and has two children. Mrs. Thompson was a former smoker  having quit 10 years ago  and has a significant family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Thompson has a recorded history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes  all of which have been managed with medications for the past 15 years. She also has a history of obesity. Five years ago she underwent a total hip replacement due to osteoarthritis. Notably  she has previously denied any history of strokes  myocardial infarctions  or blood clotting disorders.  Present Illness: The patient presented to the ER with primary complaints of increasing pain  redness  and swelling in her right lower leg  which she first noticed 3 days ago. She also mentioned a feeling of warmth over the swollen area of her leg and slight shortness of breath. However  she denied any chest pain  palpitations  or blackout. On examination  her right calf was found to be swollen and tender.  Lifestyle Factors: Mrs. Thompson's daily routine majorly involves reading  knitting  and watching TV. Although she has a mild level of physical activity  including a habit of taking short walks around her neighborhood daily  she follows an unhealthy diet which consists largely of processed and fried foods.  Possible Diagnosis and Future Steps: Considering her symptoms  past medical history  and lifestyle  we suspect a possible Deep Vein Thrombosis in the right lower limb  which may put her at risk for pulmonary embolism due to her shortness of breath. We would consider immediate ultrasound assessment for confirmation of the DVT and evaluate for pulmonary embolism while starting her on anticoagulation. It is also important to review her current medications  lifestyle  dietary habits  and diabetes management.   Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering Deep Vein Thrombosis in elderly patients presenting symptoms of leg pain  redness  and swelling  especially in the presence of risk factors such as previous surgeries  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  hypertension  diabetes  and family history of cardiovascular diseases. Treatment interventions  lifestyle modification  and diet counseling will be significant in managing Mrs. Thompson's condition.
8,1,61,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial61,Title: Case Presentation on Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information:  Mr. Robert Davis  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  who resides in Houston  TX  had been working as an accountant for the past 30 years. He practices sedentary lifestyle  admitting to lack of exercise and a diet high in fats and sugars. He is 5 ft. 11 in.  weighs 240 lbs (BMI 33.5)  and a regular smoker for 20 years. He currently lives with his wife and two children.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Davis presented to the hospital with complaints of warmth  edema  erythema  and tenderness in the left calf for the past 2 days. When asked about any recent injuries  the patient denied  but admitted to experiencing early sign of discomfort in the leg a fortnight ago but didn't seek medical attention.  Past Medical History:  He was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 10 years ago which is inadequately controlled with metformin. His most recent HbA1c was 8.2%. He also has Hypertension for 12 years and on Lisinopril  now controlled (BP  140/85). Patient has a history of Pulmonary Embolism 5 years ago  secondary to DVT from prolonged immobilization following a road traffic accident. Patient has a family history of coagulation disorders - mother had DVT; brother with Factor V Leiden mutation. Patient had an appendectomy at the age of 22.   The combination of his personal medical history  family history  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and nicotine dependence appears to have culminated into his current condition of Deep Vein Thrombosis.  Physical Examination:  The physical examination revealed the left lower limb to be swollen  warm to touch and presented a deep reddish coloration and edema when compared to the right lower limb. No findings were noted from the other systems.  Conclusion: A diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis is suspected based on patient's history and examination. Prompt diagnostic assessment to confirm our presumptive diagnosis is mandatory  optimizing his management approaches from simple lifestyle interventions  anticoagulation  to invasive procedures  all aimed at preventing a fatal Pulmonary Embolism.
8,1,62,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial62,Patient Presentation: Mrs. Julia Roberts  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department today complaining of severe pain in her right calf which started approximately 4 days ago.   Demographics: Mrs. Roberts lives in a suburban area of Nebraska  United States with her husband. She is a retired nurse and currently a homemaker. She has a history of 40 pack-years of smoking but quit smoking around ten years ago. Mrs. Roberts drinks alcohol occasionally and is not known to use any illicit drugs. She has a body mass index of 31  suggesting that she is clinically obese.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Roberts has a significant medical history that includes type 2 diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidaemia  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was hospitalized twice  once in 1995 for an appendectomy  and more recently  in 2018 for an episode of pneumonia. She has never had any clot or thrombosis-related conditions in the past.

He has been managed for hypertension for the last 15 years  and Type II diabetes for 10 years. He also has a history of prostate cancer for which he underwent successful surgical treatment 5 years ago.  Mr. Smith reported that he recently underwent a hip replacement surgery about three weeks ago. Since then  he has been primarily sedentary  spending most of his time sitting or lying down  which may have contributed to his current condition.  Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Smith was brought to the ER complaining of pain  swelling  warmth  and redness in his left calf  which has progressively worsened over the past week. He reported no chest pain or dyspnea.   Vitals upon presentation:   BP: 140/80 mmHg Pulse: 80 bpm Temperature: 98.8°F  Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute   The given symptoms along with the recent orthopedic surgery and sedentary lifestyle suggested a possible DVT.   Further investigation is necessary for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.    In conclusion  Mr. Smith's case underscores the importance of post-operative mobility and the risk factors associated with prolonged immobility leading to conditions like DVT.
8,1,64,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial64,Title: Patient Case Presentation – Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information: The patient is Mr. John Doe  a 56-year-old Caucasian male  currently working as an accountant in a multi-national corporation.

The patient's vital signs are all within normal limits.  Slide 9: Clinical Impression  Based on the patient's history  clinical presentation  and risk factors  a preliminary diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can be made.   Slide 10: Investigations  A Doppler Ultrasound has been ordered to confirm the diagnosis of DVT. Further laboratory tests will also be carried out including Complete Blood Count  Coagulation profile and D-Dimer levels.  Slide 11: Conclusion  The patient is a typical case of DVT possibly triggered by prolonged immobility during the long international flight  coupled with existing individual risk factors like a sedentary lifestyle  history of hypertension  and diabetes. Immediate medical attention and intervention are required to prevent potential complications like pulmonary embolism. Comprehensive patient education will also be essential to prevent future episodes."
8,1,66,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial66,Patient Presentation:   Our patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith  who has been presented to the emergency department with symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). The observable symptoms include swelling  redness and tenderness in his right lower leg. Significant pain has been reported with limited mobility over the last 48 hours.  Mr. Smith's demographic details are as follows:  - Age: 62 - Sex: Male - Race: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired engineer - Residence: Urban  nonsmoker  drinks alcohol occasionally - Marital status: Married with 2 grown children  In terms of past medical history  Mr. Smith has been previously diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with medications for the last 5 years. He also underwent an arthroscopic knee surgery six weeks ago.   There is a history of on and off pain in the right leg for about a month now. Mr. Smith informs the pain to have escalated in the past two days leading him to urgent care with the inability to walk without severe discomfort.   In addition to the direct relation to his symptoms  it’s worth noting that his father died from stroke and his mother passed away because of heart failure. This familial tendency for cardiovascular disease places Mr. Smith into a higher-risk category for Deep Vein Thrombosis.   In conclusion  Mr. Smith's presentation  previously documented health issues with his overall family history suggest a high index of suspicion for Deep Vein Thrombosis. Further definitive diagnostic tests such as Doppler ultrasound should be executed to confirm the diagnosis. Additionally  a review of his current medications for hypertension and diabetes should be considered  factoring in their potential interactions with any potential treatments for DVT.
8,1,67,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial67,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information: Mrs. Lauren Baines  a 73-year-old Caucasian female  retired school teacher  currently living alone. She presents with complaints of swelling  pain  and warmth over her left lower leg that has been progressively worsening over the past several days.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Baines has a significant past medical history that includes hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type II diabetes mellitus—all of which are under reasonable control via medications. She underwent a total knee replacement surgery in her right knee six years ago. She is a nonsmoker but reports occasional alcohol use. Her father had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and her mother suffered a stroke in her older age. Patient recalls being declared positive for Factor V Leiden mutation  an inherited disorder that predisposes to hypercoagulability  about a decade ago.  Current Medications: She takes Metformin (500 mg twice daily)  Lisinopril (5 mg once daily)  and Atorvastatin (20 mg once daily at night). She does not take any regular antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication.  Clinical Examination: Upon physical examination  her left calf appears swollen and erythematous  approximately 3 cm larger in circumference compared to the right one. On palpation  the entire left lower limb is warmer than the right and she complains of tenderness along the deep venous distribution. Her vital signs are stable.  Although formal diagnostic confirmation is yet to be done via Doppler ultrasound scans  these findings are highly suggestive of DVT  in a high-risk patient with numerous predisposing factors such as age  hereditary causes  recent immobility  past hospitalizations  and surgeries  etc.  Plan: She was admitted for further investigation and management. Anticoagulant medications have been initiated immediately in view of her symptoms and the high probability of DVT. A consult was sent to a vascular surgeon  and if confirmed  she may require long-term anticoagulation therapy. Further management would be decided based on her diagnostic tests results and the specialist's recommendations. Her other chronic conditions will be managed accordingly and a complete medication review will be conducted. A multi-disciplinary team approach will be adopted for overall care and to prevent any possible complications.

His weight and height are 200 lbs. and 5ft 10 inches  respectively  translating to a BMI of 28.7  which falls in the overweight category. Mr. Doe is a retired teacher  ex-smoker who quit smoking 10 years ago after a 20-year-long smoking habit. He has an occasional alcohol intake  usually only during social events.  He arrived complaining of progressive pain and swelling in his left lower leg over the last 3 days. The pain is getting more severe and he reports issues with ambulation. He has no history of a similar occurrence in the past. He noticed that the pain intensified with walking or flexing the foot. He also reports having been on a long-haul flight about a week ago.  In terms of past medical history  the patient has Type 2 Diabetes which he regulates with oral antidiabetic drugs  has been treated for High Blood Pressure using ACE inhibitors and he is known to have hypercholesterolemia. He has no known drug allergies.   In his family history  Mr. Doe’s mother had a stroke at the age of 70 and his father had a heart attack in his mid-sixties. Similarly  his paternal uncle had DVT in his late sixties.  Mr. Doe’s background of sedentary lifestyle  long-haul travel  history of smoking along with his medical history of diabetes  high blood pressure  and hyperlipidemia  coupled with a strong family history  places him at a high risk of developing vascular diseases such as DVT.   Appropriate diagnostic evaluation will be initiated to confirm the diagnosis and necessary management options will be explored. The patient needs to be aware of his risk factors  and efforts should be made to modify the modifiable ones  while adopting a healthier lifestyle to prevent recurrence or onset of other vascular diseases.

8,1,76,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial76,Patient Presentation  Introduction: We are discussing a case of a 68-year-old Caucasian female who is currently under evaluation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Demographics: Patient lives in a suburban area and is a retired school teacher. She is a non-smoker  drinks alcohol socially  and exercises moderately. Her family history has been significant for cardiovascular disease  with both parents having succumbed to heart-related disorders.  Presenting Problem: The patient came in complaining of increased swelling  tenderness  pain  and warmness in the right lower extremities  which she noticed a few days ago. The pain is exacerbated on walking and standing. She mentions no recent long-distance travel  surgeries  or injuries.  Medical History: The patient has a known medical history of hypertension and type II diabetes  both of which are well-controlled with medications. A detailed medication history reveals daily administration of Metformin and Lisinopril. The patient has been compliant with her medications and follows a recommended diabetic diet plan.   She had a hysterectomy 20 years ago due to uterine fibroids and a motor vehicle accident in her teens resulted in a fractured tibia  which was treated with internal fixation.  Evaluation: On physical examination  her lower right leg is noticeably swollen  warm to touch  and shows signs of erythema. The patient winces when the calf muscle is squeezed  indicating pain. Initial ultrasound investigation has shown positive signs of clot formation in the deep veins of the right leg.   Summary: This patient's age  personal health history  and the symptomatic presentation are all highly suggestive of deep vein thrombosis. Further analysis is required to confirm this and plan the appropriate treatment strategy to prevent potential complications such as pulmonary embolism.
8,1,77,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial77,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male named John Doe. He presents today with an acutely swollen  warm  and painful left calf. He states that he noticed the swelling about two days ago and has been feeling generally unwell with intermittent low-grade fevers.   His past medical history includes hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and a recent hip replacement surgery on the same side about three weeks ago. The patient admits to a sedentary lifestyle and long periods of immobility post-surgery  as he lives alone and hasn’t been getting out much. Social history reveals that he is an ex-smoker  having quit 15 years ago  and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has a family history of cardiovascular diseases with his father dying from a myocardial infarction in his late 60s. Mr. Doe does not have any known allergies.   His current home medications include ramipril for hypertension and rosuvastatin for hypercholesterolemia. Recently  he was on post-operative prophylactic low molecular weight heparin  which stopped a week ago.   On examination  his left calf is significantly swollen and tender along the deep venous route with noticeable erythema. On palpation  the left calf is considerably warmer than the right  there is a palpable cord feeing in the calf region consistent with a superficial vein becoming hard and tender. He had a positive Homan's sign.  Given the patient's surgery history  symptoms  and physical exam  there is a high clinical suspicion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity  which is concerning due to the risk of pulmonary embolism. Immediate diagnostic studies  specifically a venous Doppler ultrasound  has been ordered to confirm the diagnosis. An intervention plan will be initiated based on the findings. 
8,1,78,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial78,Title: Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Demographics:  Patient is Mr. John Doe  a 58-year-old Caucasian male. He works as an corporate attorney and is a smoker for approximately 20 years  consuming a pack of cigarettes per day. His alcohol use is moderate  and body mass index (BMI) is 30  which classifies him as obese. Mr. Doe lives alone after his divorce five years ago. He has no consistent exercise regimen and frequently reports prolonged periods of immobility due to the nature of his job.   Presenting Symptoms:  Mr. Doe reports an acute onset of pain and swelling in his left lower leg  which he initially dismissed as muscular cramp. However  the pain has been worsening over the past 24 hours  which led him to seek medical care. He further reports experiencing a feeling of warmth over the swollen area  and noticed that the skin is slightly discolored (red).  Past Medical History: Review of Mr. Doe's medical record reveals he has hypertension which he has been managing for last 10 years with lisinopril. Moreover  he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus three years ago which is being managed by oral hypoglycemics. His last HbA1c three months ago was 7.8%. Unfortunately his compliance with his medications has been questionable due to his hectic work schedule. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease  his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 62 and his elder sister had a DVT following a long-haul flight 5 years ago.   Clinical Status: Mr. Doe appeared distressed due to pain  however his vital signs were stable. On physical examination  his left lower leg was markedly swollen  warm and erythematous. He displayed a positive Homan's sign. Initial ultrasound confirmed the presence of a thrombosis in the left popliteal vein  and D-dimer was significantly elevated  thus confirming the diagnosis of DVT.   Treatment:  Treatment was initiated promptly with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)  and patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation and possible thrombectomy. Patient education was also conducted with regards to the importance of medication compliance  lifestyle modifications  and deep vein thrombosis disease management.  Prognosis:  The prognosis is uncertain due to his chronic medical conditions and lifestyle  but with proper adherence to treatment and lifestyle modifications  risk of recurrence and complications can be significantly reduced. Early detection and intervention have improved his chance of recovery significantly.
8,1,79,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial79,Title: Clinical Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Profile: The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian female named Mrs. Jane Doe. She is a retired school teacher residing in New York City with her spouse. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. She maintains a healthy diet and performs a moderate level of physical activity regularly.   Past Medical History: Mrs. Doe has a history of medical conditions including Hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). She was diagnosed with these conditions 10 years ago and has been managing them through lifestyle interventions and medication. She takes Lisinopril (10mg daily) for HTN and Metformin (500mg twice daily) for T2DM. Additionally  she is overweight with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 28. There is no relevant family history of any genetic/coagulopathy disorders.  Current Presentation: Mrs. Doe reported to the emergency department complaining about a subtly progressive pain in her left leg that began five days prior. The pain was dull  continuous but non-radiating. She also noted that her left leg appeared swollen and slightly warmer to touch than her right leg. No discoloration was observed.   She further reported not having any recent history of prolonged immobility  surgical operations  major traumas  or long-haul air travel. She denies any chest pain  cough  shortness of breath  or abdominal pain.   Examinations and Investigations: Upon clinical examination  her left calf showed signs of swelling  tenderness  warmth  and erythema. Vital signs were within normal ranges. A Doppler Ultrasound was performed that confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the left femoral vein  hence establishing the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  Conclusion: Together with the clinical presentation and the results of the diagnostic tests  Mrs. Doe was diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis. The present episode of DVT could likely be triggered by her existing HTN  T2DM  and obesity. She would need anticoagulation therapy and close monitoring in the hospital to prevent potential complications like pulmonary embolism. Further investigations would also be required to rule out any malignancies as they could be a hidden trigger for the DVT.   Early recognition  appropriate diagnostic investigations  and prompt treatment are key to managing DVT effectively in such patients. This case emphasizes the importance of strong differential diagnostic skills and individualized care approach to manage such patients effectively.
8,1,80,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial80,Title: Patient Presentation - Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Identity: Mr. Arthur Greene  a 72-year-old Caucasian male  retired bank clerk and resident of New York City  reported to the emergency department on the 2nd of July with symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis.  Demographics and Social History:  Mr. Greene lives with his wife and they have two adult children. He is a non-smoker  non-alcoholic with no known drug allergies. He has a sedentary lifestyle and has a BMI of 28. Mr. Greene's dietary habits lean towards the excessive consumption of red meat and high-fat processed foods.   Presenting Concern:  The patient complained of persistent pain  swelling and redness in his right lower leg which he initially attributed to arthritis flares but became concerned when these symptoms persisted for over a week  accompanied by localized warmth and slight fever.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Greene has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and Type II diabetes  all of which have been reasonably well-controlled with medications. He has had two episodes of ischemic stroke in the past 5 years. The patient also underwent an orthopedic surgery after a hip fracture 2 months ago. He has been on bed rest since then due to postoperative complications.   Family History:  Mr. Greene's father died of myocardial infarction while his mother had a history of varicose veins. His elder brother also suffers from coronary artery disease  suggesting a possible genetic predisposition to cardiovascular diseases.   Conclusion: Mr. Greene's age  static lifestyle  obesity  recent surgery and extended bed rest  coupled with his existing chronic conditions (hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and diabetes) all put him at an increased risk for deep vein thrombosis. His persistent leg symptoms   feverishness and family history also strongly suggest a diagnosis of DVT but further diagnostic tests like ultrasound and D-dimer tests are required to confirm this diagnosis. In the meantime  immediate therapeutic action is needed to prevent possible serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.
8,1,81,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial81,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Clinical Case Review  Patient’s Details: Name: Mr. Michael Johnson Age: 55 years Gender: Male Occupation: Office Clerk Ethnicity: Caucasian Residential Location: Chicago  IL  USA   Present Complaint: Mr. Johnson consults today regarding episode of progressive swelling  pain  and warmth in the left lower limb that he's been experiencing for the past three days  which has begun to cause walking difficulties due to severity of discomfort.  Medical History: Mr. Johnson is an active smoker  smoking around 15 cigarettes per day for the past 20 years. He has a history of hypertension and peripheral artery disease (PAD) and takes aspirin and lisinopril daily for these conditions. His father had a history of deep vein thrombosis. He leads a sedentary lifestyle due to the nature of his desk-bound job and moderate obesity  with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31.  Medication: 1. Aspirin 75mg- Once daily in the morning 2. Lisinopril 10mg- Once daily at night  Allergies:  Mr. Johnson reports no known drug allergies.  Examination: Upon physical exam  the left calf is noted to be 3cm larger in circumference compared to the right one  which is warm and tender to touch. There are no visible skin changes or ulcerations.   Investigation: Investigations will comprise of a Doppler ultrasound to confirm the presence of DVT and blood tests for coagulation profile.  Impression: Mr. Johnson presents with symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis  which is supported by his risk factors that include prolonged immobilization  personal and family history of vascular disease  and smoking habit.  Follow Up and Recommendations: The patient has been advised to quit smoking and suggested lifestyle changes towards a more active routine  weight loss  and healthier diet. If DVT is confirmed  anticoagulant therapy initiation will also be considered. Referral to a vascular specialist may be required. Regular follow-up visits will monitor progress and adjust therapy as needed.
8,1,82,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial82,Patient Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis   Demographic Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male named John Doe. He is of British descent  was born and lives in Manchester  UK. He is married  has two adult children and is a retired accountant. He currently smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily and has smoked regularly for 45 years. The patient reports his alcohol intake as moderate and denies illicit drug use. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 29.5 kg/m2 which indicates he is overweight. The patient was referred to the Phlebology clinic by his Primary Care Provider.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a known history of hypertension  well-controlled with medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily)  and Type 2 diabetes  managed with metformin (500mg BID). His familial history is significant for cardiovascular diseases - both his father and elder brother deceased due to myocardial infarction. He has had one previous episode of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) five years back.   Recent Hospitalization: Mr. Doe was recently hospitalized for 10 days following a left total knee arthroplasty. During the period of immobilization post-surgery  he was given list-protocol prophylactic low molecular weight heparin.  Current Presentation: Mr. Doe has presented with a several-day history of increased swelling and discomfort in the left lower extremity  which is the same side of his recent knee surgery. He described the pain as a “continuous cramp” that does not improve with rest or over-the-counter pain medication. He also reported slight shortness of breath. Consequently  a clinical concern was raised for possible Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  The physical examination revealed a swollen and somewhat erythematous left leg. His vital signs at the clinic included a blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg  a pulse of 78 beats/min  respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min  and the SpO2 was at 96%. A venous Doppler ultrasound has been ordered to confirm the diagnosis of DVT. He has been admitted for further evaluation and treatment as he could be at high risk due to his past medical history.
8,1,83,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial83,Patient Presentation:  We are presenting case of a 57-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. X  with a primary complaint of unilateral leg swelling and pain. Mr. X is a non-smoker  occasional alcohol consumer and does not report any illicit substance use. He lives independently and works as a truck driver  often sitting for extended periods.  Past Medical History: Mr. X's past medical history is significant for obesity (BMI 31)  controlled hypertension (on Lisinopril 10mg daily)  and type 2 diabetes managed with Metformin 500mg twice a day. He had uncomplicated gallbladder surgery five years ago. His family history indicates a father who died of a myocardial infarction at age 62 and a maternal aunt with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). On social history  he has low physical activity level besides his work. He has no known drug allergies.   Upon examination  we observed that the patient’s right calf was significantly swollen  warm  and tender to touch. The condition had been gradually worsening over the past week  compelling him to seek medical assistance. He also mentioned shortness of breath that developed in the last 2 days.   Based on the clinical presentation  history of prolonged immobilization due to his occupation  and familial history of DVT  a preliminary diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis was made.  This case warrants urgent diagnostic confirmation and management due to the risk of pulmonary embolism  particularly given the recent development of shortness of breath. To confirm a diagnosis  a Duplex ultrasound is planned. Advice on immediate lifestyle modifications to reduce obesity and enhance activity levels  as well as potential anticoagulation therapy depending on the imaging results  are currently being deliberated.
8,1,84,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial84,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Anthony Thompson is a 72-year-old Caucasian male who has presented to the clinic today with a one-week history of progressive  unilateral leg swelling and pain in the calf muscle of his right leg. He has described his pain as cramp-like in nature  which worsens upon standing and walking but reduces upon resting and leg elevation. There is also noticeable warmth over the site and discoloration.   Mr. Thompson is a retired construction worker and has been living independently since his wife passed away two years ago. He is a father of two adult children. He has a 60-pack year smoking history  having quit ten years ago. He neither drinks alcohol nor uses illicit drugs.   His past medical history is significant for hypertension for which he is on Amlodipine 5mg once daily and Type 2 diabetes mellitus which is managed on Metformin 500mg twice daily and dietary modifications. He also underwent a total knee replacement surgery of his right knee 15 years ago.   Family history is notable for coronary artery disease in his father  who passed away from a myocardial infarction in his early seventies. His mother had a stroke in her late seventies.   He is not known to have any allergies. He has not been on any recent long-haul flights or undergone recent surgeries but does generally lead quite a sedentary lifestyle.  Considering his clinical evaluation and risk factors such as old age  sedentary lifestyle  and history of knee replacement surgery  a presumptive diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) has been made. Further investigations  including D-dimer test  duplex ultrasound  or venography  will need to be pursued for confirmation.  The proposed plan would be to start anticoagulant therapy as early as possible once the diagnosis of DVT is established  to prevent any life-threatening complications such as a pulmonary embolism. A referral to a vascular surgeon or hematology specialist may be contemplated. Dietary consultation and supervised exercise programs will also be arranged for better management of his conditions.   Education about the risk factors for developing DVT and its signs and symptoms would be offered to the patient and his family members. This would aid in early recognition and prompt treatment  thus reducing healthcare costs and potential morbidity.
8,1,85,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial85,Presentation of Patient: I would like to present a case of a 62-year-old African American male who is positive for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). The patient  Mr. Johnson  has been a resident of West Perrine  Florida for the past thirty years and is recently retired from a desk job occupation.   Current Presentation and Symptoms: Mr. Johnson presented to the emergency department after noticing a significant swelling in his left leg  increased warmth in the swollen area  and a constant dull ache that's notable for its severity. The onset of these symptoms was sudden and noticed 2 days ago. He also mentioned experiencing shortness of breath on exertion  occasional dizziness  and unexplained fatigue in recent days.  Past Medical History: On further enquiry  I learned that Mr. Johnson is a known hypertensive and has been on medication for the past ten years. Other than hypertension  his medical chart reveals a history of prostate cancer  for which he underwent successful surgery approximately five years ago. He has been under continuous observation and check-ups for the same. Moreover  he has a history of smoking - approximately 30 pack years  quit smoking five years back  around the time of his cancer surgery. He also has a documented history of sedentary lifestyle  which is associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis.  Family History: He also acknowledged that his family history is significant  as both his parents and older sibling died due to cardiac-related ailments.   Currently  the therapeutic management for this patient includes the administration of anticoagulants  with a focus on quickly reducing symptoms and preventing the progression of DVT. Future evaluation and management will require an interdisciplinary approach. The care team includes vascular surgeons  cardiologists  physical therapists  and nutritionists for comprehensive care and secondary prevention efforts.

He admits to moderate alcohol consumption  specifically wine during social events.   In his family history  his mother suffered from a myocardial infarction and his father had a stroke. The patient has a sedentary lifestyle with minimal regular physical activity. He also reports frequent long-distance travels related to his work  which includes prolonged periods of immobility.   There are no known drug allergies. He is regular with his hypertension medications and is not currently on any other therapy or blood thinners.  Given the patient's lifestyle  family history  and current symptoms  a more in-depth investigation for potential deep vein thrombosis is warranted.
8,1,88,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial88,Slide 1: Patient Overview  The patient is a 68-year-old African American male named Mr. Johnson  who currently resides in Baltimore  MD. He is a retired construction worker  had been a heavy smoker for more than 40 years  and has a sedentary lifestyle.  Slide 2: Main Complaint  Mr. Johnson came to our clinic presenting with severe calf pain and swelling on his right leg  which he noticed worsened over the past week. He described his pain as a constant  dull ache worsened with walking.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and previous myocardial infarction about 5 years ago. Medications include metformin for diabetes  lisinopril for hypertension  and simvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He also has a family history of vascular disorders and stroke.   Slide 4: Clinical Presentation  Physical examination revealed a noticeably swollen  red  and warm right lower extremity. His vitals were stable  but he exhibited positive Homan’s sign (pain in calf or popliteal region with abrupt dorsiflexion of the foot).   Slide 5: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Given his symptomatology and risk factors  Mr. Johnson was diagnosed with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He underwent an ultrasound of his lower extremities  which was confirmatory for DVT.   Slide 6: Management   Outpatient treatment was initiated with therapeutic anticoagulation using low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin. Consideration for thrombolytic therapy should be made given the extensive DVT. Furthermore  Mr. Johnson was encouraged to increase daily physical activities  smoking cessation  and maintain a healthy diet to manage his underlying conditions better. He was also advised on the importance of adherence to his medications.   Slide 7: Follow-Up and Monitoring  Regular follow-ups and monitoring  including blood tests (PT  INR) to adjust warfarin dosage and monitor therapeutic levels and repeat ultrasounds to track the resolution of the DVT  were scheduled. Additionally  the importance of early detection of signs of complication  such as chest pain or breathlessness  which may suggest pulmonary embolism  was emphasized.   Mr. Johnson's case underscores the critical role of risk factor management in preventing deep vein thrombosis and highlights the significant impact that lifestyle modifications can make on disease outcomes.
8,1,89,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial89,**Case Presentation**  Today  we're discussing a 58-year-old African American female presenting with unexplained pain and swelling in her left leg.   *Patient Details:*   Name: Mrs. Jane Doe   Age: 58   Gender: Female   Race: African American   Occupation: Retired School Teacher    *Chief Complaint:*   Onset of unexplained  localized pain and swelling in the left lower extremity  suggesting potential DVT.  *History of Present Illness:*   Mrs Doe observed the increased swelling and pain in her left leg two days ago. The leg pain seemed to be more intense when she was standing or walking. There is no history of trauma or injury to her leg. She reported mild discomfort and warmth over the area. No previous similar episodes in the past. No symptoms of sudden shortness of breath  chest pain  lightheadedness  or fainting.  *Past Medical History:*    Long history of Type II diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. She underwent a hysterectomy 20 years ago. Previous smoker  who quit 10 years ago. No history of thromboembolism  clotting disorders  or malignancy. Mrs. Doe is also overweight with a BMI of 32.  *Medications:*   Taking Metformin for diabetes  Lisinopril for hypertension  and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.  *Allergies:*   No known drug allergies.  *Review of Systems:*   Nothing significant from other systems.  *Family History:*   Her mother had a history of deep vein thrombosis and her father had a history of stroke. Her older brother also has diabetes and hypertension.  *Physical Exam:*   Upon physical examination  the patient appeared in mild distress. Her left calf was notably swollen and erythematous. The left calf was also approximately 3 cm larger in circumference than the right. It was warmer to touch compared to the corresponding area on the right leg.  Based on the clinical history and physical exam findings  the differential diagnosis should consider deep vein thrombosis as the main cause. This indication is based on her clinical presentation coupled with the constellations of risk factors including a family history of DVT  obesity  hypertension  diabetes  and hyperlipidemia. Venous Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremity would be recommended for further investigation and confirmation.
8,1,90,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial90,Slide 1: Introduction  Today  we are discussing the case of Mrs. Mary Smith  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  currently a non-smoker  with a BMI of 32.6  who presented with complaints of pain and swelling in her right lower extremity.   Slide 2: Past Medical History  Mrs. Smith has a significant past medical history including type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia  all of which have been managed with medication  as prescribed. She also underwent hip replacement surgery on her right side  three weeks ago.  Slide 3: Current Presentation  Post-surgical  Mrs. Smith had been primarily non-ambulatory and upon presentation  reported a dull ache in her right calf that had increased over the past several days. The leg was significantly swollen  erythematous  and warm to the touch. She also reported unexplained shortness of breath  particularly post-exertion  which began around the same time as the leg pain.   Slide 4: Risk Factors  Assessing her risk factors  we see several high-risk elements. She has recent orthopedic surgery  prolonged immobility  obesity  and advanced age. All these factors increase her risk for hypercoagulability and could potentially lead to deep vein thrombosis.   Slide 5: Diagnosis & Recommendations  Based on her symptoms  clinical presentation  and risk profile we strongly suspect deep vein thrombosis. Further investigations include a D-Dimer test and possibly a Doppler ultrasound of the affected extremity to confirm the diagnosis. We recommend initiation of Anticoagulation therapy as per the protocol  pending test results  consider inferior vena cava filter placement and encourage early ambulation. Additionally  patient education on the importance of medication compliance  outpatient follow-up  and immediate reporting of any changes in symptoms should also be prioritized.   Slide 6: Conclusions  This case highlights the importance of vigilance in post-surgical patients  particularly those who are immobilized and have multiple risk factors for hypercoagulability and deep vein thrombosis. Early detection and treatment of DVT are crucial to prevent severe complications  such as pulmonary embolism.
8,1,91,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial91,Slide 1: Introduction The patient is Mrs. Eleanor Smith  a 72-year-old Caucasian female with an onset of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She is a retired teacher who lives in Jonesboro  Arkansas  with her husband. She is a non-smoker and rarely consumes alcohol.  Slide 2: Presenting Symptoms Eleanor presented with a 4-day history of increasing left calf pain and swelling. She reported feeling warmth over the affected area. There is no history of trauma or injury. She also noted a recent reduction in her mobility due to occasional shortness of breath. No chest pain or palpitation was observed.  Slide 3: Relevant Medical History Eleanor has a known history of hypertension  which is well controlled with medication (ramipril 10 mg daily). She underwent a total left hip replacement 5 years ago for osteoarthritis with no complications. Furthermore  a year ago  she was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus  which is managed with metformin. There were no previous reported instances or family history of thromboembolic diseases.  Slide 4: Recent Medical Interventions  Approximately 2 weeks ago  Eleanor traveled on a long (>5 hours) flight after visiting her daughter  during which she remained seated most of the time. During her visit  she was mostly sedentary due to the cold weather.  Slide 5: Assessment  Physical examination showed a mildly distressed patient due to pain. Her left leg was swollen and tender along the line of the femoral vein  and there was mild erythema. Her vital signs were within normal limits.  Slide 6: Preliminary Diagnosis & Next Steps Suspicion of deep vein thrombosis is high due to her clinical presentation and risk factors  which include her age  recent prolonged travel  and history of reduced mobility. Confirmation of diagnosis and further management will require investigation tests  including a D-dimer test and potentially an ultrasound of the affected leg.
8,1,92,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial92,Subject: Presentation of Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Introduction: Mr. Henry  a 58-year-old Caucasian male  presents with a week-long history of increasing left calf pain  redness  and swelling. His medical history indicates known risk factors for DVT  including recent knee replacement surgery six weeks prior  history of smoking and obesity.  Demographic Information: Sex: Male Age: 58 years Race: Caucasian Occupation: Computer Engineer Marital Status: Married  Clinical Features: The patient describes the pain being 7 out of 10  continuous in nature  localized mainly to the left calf area. He states it mildly improves with rest and drastically exacerbates with walking. Accompanying symptoms include mild shortness of breath on exertion  warm skin over the affected area  and increased calf circumference compared to the right leg. Mr. Henry denies any significant changes in the chest pain  coughing up blood  dizziness  or fainting.  Medical History: Mr. Henry has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both well-controlled with medication. He had his left knee replaced six weeks earlier and completed a total of two weeks of postoperative prophylaxis with enoxaparin. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking and Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31  indicating Grade I obesity. He denies any history of previous blood clots  stroke  or known malignancies. He also denies any family history of clotting disorders.   Current Medication: 1. Lisinopril for hypertension  2. Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia  Risk Factors: His sedentary lifestyle  recent surgery  obesity  and smoking create a significant risk profile for DVT.   That concludes a brief overview of Mr. Henry's presentation. The next step requires detailed physical examination  blood work  and imaging (like a Doppler Ultrasound) for definitive diagnosis and commencement of appropriate anti-coagulant therapy. Early identification and correct treatment are critical to prevent life-threatening complications like Pulmonary Embolism.

8,1,94,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial94,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. Thomas Blake  is a 65-year-old Caucasian male recently retired from his sedentary corporate job. Mr. Blake  a resident of New York  NY  presents with symptoms suggesting deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He has been experiencing mild swelling  pain  and tenderness in his left calf for the past few days. Upon physical examination  that area shows minor redness and warmth. The pain increases when he flexes his foot. However  he does not have any chest pain  palpitation  or breathing difficulty.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Blake is a smoker with a 40 pack-year history  with his BMI categorized as overweight (BMI of 28). He also has hypertension for the last 10 years  which is currently controlled by daily diovan and hydrochlorothiazide administration. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago  which is managed by metformin and lifestyle modifications.  He does not have any history of major surgeries and has never experienced any clotting disorders or strokes in the past. Two years ago  he underwent a total knee replacement due to osteoarthritis  without any post-operative complications reported.  Family history revealed that his father and older brother were both diagnosed and treated for DVT  and his mother died due to a stroke.  Conclusion:  Given Mr. Blake's age  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  smoking habit  hypertension  diabetes  family history  and his symptoms mentioned above  he is at high risk for deep vein thrombosis. Further diagnostic procedures like ultrasound or D-dimer tests are required to confirm the current hypothesis.   Upon confirmation of DVT  appropriate treatment – which may involve anticoagulants and lifestyle modifications – would be initiated. Given his underlying conditions  regular follow-up with his primary care physician  cardiologist  and endocrinologist would be recommended. It is important to educate the patient about DVT and the importance of early recognition of symptoms to prevent complications like pulmonary embolism.
8,1,95,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial95,Presentation  Patient Information: Mr. John Deer  a 64-year-old Caucasian male  presents with signs and symptoms consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Presenting Issue: Mr. Deer reports recent significant discomfort  swelling  and slight discoloration primarily in his left calf over the past week. He also mentions that he had flu-like symptoms  including general fatigue and low-grade fevers for the past 5-6 days. He denies any trauma or injury to the area.

He enjoys gardening but has no other regular physical activity.   Medical History: His medical history includes hypertension (HTN) that has been controlled with medication (Lisinopril) over the last 5 years. He also had a minor heart attack seven years ago  for which he underwent angioplasty and was prescribed daily aspirin. He reports occasional bouts of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Given the potential for DVT  his family history becomes of immediate relevance: his mother had a pulmonary embolism at 70 years old  and two siblings have been previously diagnosed with DVT.  Review of Systems: The patient denies chest pain  shortness of breath  palpitations  or syncopal episodes. He also denies abdominal pain  nausea  vomiting  changes in bowel or bladder function. There's no report of changes in sleep patterns  vision or hearing problems  or severe headaches. He denies any significant weight loss or gain.  Physical Examination: Mr. Deer had elevated blood pressure reading of 150/95 mmHg  and his other vitals were within normal limits. The left calf appeared to be swollen  warm  and visibly redder compared to the right.  Observations: The primary concern is that Mr. Deer's signs  symptoms  and medical family history increase his risk of developing DVT. Further diagnostic testing  including an ultrasound of the lower extremity and necessary blood tests  should be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. He should be instructed regarding the signs of embolic events and be started on appropriate anticoagulant therapy pending the results of diagnostic tests.  Patient Education: Mr. Deer needs to be informed about the seriousness of his condition and the importance of adhering to his treatment regimen. He should be advised to reduce alcohol consumption and to engage in regular physical activity like walking.

His older sister  aged 70  is currently being treated for type 2 diabetes.  Given the findings of leg swelling  pain  warmth  redness  and the patient’s significant medical history  the preliminary diagnosis is Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). We recommend immediate diagnostic testing by Doppler ultrasound to confirm the presence of DVT and initiate treatment as needed.
8,1,98,diagnosis8-prompt1-trial98,"Title: Presentation of a Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient Demographic Information: The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer  who currently resides in Asheville  North Carolina. He is married  a non-smoker  and has a moderate consumption of alcohol. His weight is about 180 lbs  and he is 6'1"""" in height. The patient's Body Mass Index (BMI) indicates that he is on the border of an overweight and normal weight class.  Presenting Issue: Mr. X visited the clinic while complaining of an uncomfortable sensation in his left leg for around one week. Upon examination  the leg was found to be noticeably swollen and warm to the touch. There is mild redness and tenderness along the path of the inner thigh. The patient stated that the discomfort is moderate at rest but increases upon walking. Mr. X revealed that he did not sustain any recent injuries nor was involved in any physically demanding activities that could potentially lead to muscle strain.   Past Medical History: Mr. X's past medical history reveals that he is hypertensive and has been on medication for the last 10 years. His high cholesterol level also required him to take omega-3 supplements. He is pre-diabetic but managing through dietary changes and increased physical activity.   Additionally  Mr. X had a right hip replacement surgery five years ago due to chronic arthritis and was immobilized for a considerable period feeding to his sedentary lifestyle. Besides  Mr. X had a history of deep vein thrombosis in his right leg  nearly three years back which was resolved through anticoagulant therapy.   His familial medical history indicates that his mother suffered from deep vein thrombosis and passed away at the age of 75 from pulmonary embolism  while his father survived two myocardial infarctions before dying at 81 due to congestive heart failure.  These symptoms and past medical history suggest that Mr. X has a moderate to high risk of deep vein thrombosis recurrence  which may be the reason behind his current complaints. More tests such as a D-dimer blood test  duplex ultrasound  or in severe cases  a venogram should be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with anticoagulants can help prevent life-threatening complications like a pulmonary embolism.  Professional consult from a vascular specialist is advised for Mr. X's case due to his past medical history."

8,3,16,diagnosis8-prompt3-trial16,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis - A Case Study  Slide 1: Introduction Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a potentially serious condition characterised by the formation of a blood clot within the deep veins  commonly the leg.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics and Past Medical History  Our patient  Mr. John Doe  is a 55-year-old Caucasian male. He works as a software engineer and leads a sedentary lifestyle with prolonged periods of sitting. He is a moderate smoker with a pack a day. Mr. Doe has a medical history of obesity  hypertension  and Type II Diabetes.  Slide 3: Presenting Symptoms Mr. Doe sought help when he noticed swelling and pain in his left lower leg which progressively increased over a week. Also reported instances of shortness of breath.  Slide 4: Physical Examination  The physical examination revealed calf tenderness  warmth and erythema in his left lower leg  along with a positive Homan’s sign. There was no evidence of superficial vein varicosities or oedema elsewhere in the body.  Slide 5: Diagnostic Tests Subsequently  Mr. Doe underwent a venous Doppler ultrasound revealing a clot in the left deep veins  confirming a diagnosis of DVT. Additional tests such as D-dimer and chest CT were conducted to rule out pulmonary embolism due to the shortness of breath.  Slide 6: Management and Treatment Treatment was initiated with low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH)  followed by oral anticoagulants for a duration of three months. Mr. Doe was counseled regarding lifestyle modifications including regular exercise  healthier eating habits  smoking cessation  and optimal control of blood pressure and diabetes.  Slide 7: Prognosis With early diagnosis and the initiation of apt treatment  Mr. Doe’s prognosis is considered good. However  long-term management of risk factors is crucial to prevent recurrence of DVT.  Slide 8: Conclusion Due to common symptoms  DVT often remains undiagnosed. Therefore  it is crucial to thoroughly evaluate patients with risk factors such as sedentary behaviour  smoking  obesity  hypertension  and diabetes. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve patient prognosis.   Slide 9: Discussion and Questions Let's discuss preventive measures  the different tools for diagnosing DVT in routine clinical practice  and how to promote awareness about DVT in at-risk groups.

8,3,18,diagnosis8-prompt3-trial18,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Case Study  Slide 1 - Introduction:  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a blood clot forms in one of the deep-seated  large veins of the lower limbs or pelvis. DVT has a prevalence rate of approximately 1 in 1 000 in the general population. Let’s discuss the case of a 60-year-old individual who was diagnosed with DVT.  Slide 2 - Patient Demographics:  Our patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian female who is retired. She lives in a suburban neighborhood and has an independent lifestyle. Prior to retirement  her job was sedentary in nature. She is a nonsmoker but has a history of obesity.  Slide 3 - Past Medical History:  The patient has a notable past medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension which were both diagnosed 5 years ago. There is no surgical history. She is currently taking Metformin for diabetes and Lisinopril for hypertension. She has a strong family history of heart diseases. No known allergies to medications.  Slide 4 - Presenting Symptoms:  The patient came to the emergency department with complaints of increasing painful swelling in her left lower leg over a period of three days. She also noted accompanying redness and warmth over the area  but denied any trauma or injury.  Slide 5 - Diagnosis and Treatment:  Based on her symptoms  a Doppler ultrasound was conducted  confirming the diagnosis of DVT in the left lower extremity. She has been started on a low molecular weight heparin initially (Enoxaparin)  and thereafter  will be transitioned to oral anticoagulants  specifically a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as Apixaban  for long-term management.   Slide 6 - Risk Factor Evaluation and Management:  Given her age  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and history of hypertension and diabetes  the patient had multiple risk factors for DVT. Going forward  lifestyle modifications including weight loss  good glucose control  regular exercise  a heart-healthy diet  and regular follow-ups are recommended to manage these risk factors.  Slide 7 - Conclusion:  This case illustrates the importance of vigilance and quick response in patients presenting with symptoms of DVT  particularly in those with multiple risk factors  to prevent potentially severe complications  such as pulmonary embolism. It is also crucial to manage the underlying risk factors to prevent recurrence of DVT.   Slide 8 - Q&A:  Now  it's opened for questions and discussions regarding the case.

8,3,98,diagnosis8-prompt3-trial98,"Title: A Clinical Case Study on Deep Vein Thrombosis   Slide 1: Introduction  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a serious condition where a blood clot forms within a deep vein  typically in the leg. Today's case study focuses on a patient who needed a swift and comprehensive treatment arrangement due to this condition.  Slide 2: Patient Demographics  Our patient  Anderson  is a 47-year-old Caucasian male who works as an architect  primarily a sedentary job that involves long hours of sitting. He is a non-smoker  moderate alcohol consumer  and the only exerciser occasionally. Anderson is married  with two children.  Slide 3: Past Medical History  Anderson has a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with medication (lisinopril and atorvastatin  respectively). He has no known drug allergies. There is a family history of deep vein thrombosis (his father was diagnosed in his late 60s).  Slide 4: Current Health Concerns  Anderson reported increasing discomfort in his left calf over the past four days. He describes the pain as a """"deep ache"""" and noticed his calf was painfully swollen  warm to touch  and slightly redder than his other calf. There was no clear history of trauma  but he recently traveled abroad on a long-haul flight for a business meeting.  Slide 5: Physical Examination  Anderson has visible edema and erythema on his left calf. His vital signs were normal. Distal pulses in the lower extremities were equally palpable. However  due to the patient's history and presentation  a DVT was suspected.  Slide 6: Diagnosis  To confirm the diagnosis  an ultrasound was performed  showing a blood clot in the left superficial femoral vein  confirming deep vein thrombosis. Blood tests showed an elevated d-dimer level  but other results were generally within normal levels.  Slide 7: Treatment Plan  Anderson was prescribed anticoagulants (initially low molecular weight heparin followed by warfarin) to prevent the clot from enlarging. We also commenced compression therapy for his leg. He was educated about the signs of an elevated risk  particularly pulmonary embolism. Due to his sedentary job  modification and stretches were suggested.  Slide 8: Conclusion  Due to Anderson's previous medical history  ongoing monitoring is crucial to prevent any complications associated with the current DVT. Lifestyle modifications could improve his prognosis and prevent recurring DVTs. We emphasize the importance of follow-ups to assess Anderson's response to treatment and make any necessary adjustments.  Slide 9: Learning Point  This case underlines the importance of considering DVT in patients with unilateral leg pain and swelling  especially with risk factors such as prolonged immobilization  like long-haul flights."

Slide 3: Presentation  Presenting features: The patient reported to the emergency department with acute onset of left leg swelling and pain. He has noted worsening of symptoms over 3 days  localized tenderness in calf  and redness. No history of trauma.  Slide 4: Past Medical History  The patient has a known history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension  for which he is on medication. He has had no previous surgeries or known allergies. His father had a history of DVT.  Slide 5: Observations and Examination  On examination  noticeable swelling in the left calf compared to the right  redness over the left calf  and warm to touch. Vital signs within normal limits except for slightly elevated BP (145/90 mm Hg). No respiratory distress observed.  Slide 6: Investigations  A duplex ultrasound was performed  which confirmed the presence of thrombus in the left popliteal vein. The patient’s D-dimer levels were elevated.   Slide 7: Diagnosis  Based on these clinical findings  observations  and results from ultrasound and lab tests  a diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis was made.  Slide 8: Treatment and Management  Anticoagulation therapy was initiated immediately with low molecular weight heparin. Patient education regarding weight management  exercise  and the importance of regular follow-ups for monitoring of medication and condition.  Slide 9: Prognosis  With close follow-up and adherence to the recommended lifestyle modifications and treatment plan  the patient's prognosis is generally good barring any complications.   Slide 10: Conclusion  Deep Vein Thrombosis is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Regular screening and management of risk factors  like obesity and uncontrolled diabetes  are crucial in preventing DVT  especially in patients with familial predisposition. 
8,3,100,diagnosis8-prompt3-trial100,Title: Case Presentation on Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  [Slide 1] I. Introduction  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a medical condition characterized by formation of blood clots in one of the deep veins  commonly in the legs. Understanding this further  let's look at a DVT case involving a 68-year-old female patient.  [Slide 2] II. Patient Demographics Patient Profile: - Age: 68 years old - Sex: Female - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Occupation: Retired teacher  [Slide 3] III. Presenting Complaint  Principal Issue: The patient reported experiencing pain and swelling in the left lower limb for one week.  [Slide 4] IV. Past Medical History Our patient has a compelling past medical history: 1. Hypertension for 15 years  managed with Captopril 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 10 years ago  currently managed with Metformin 3. History of Breast Cancer – treated 7 years ago with a lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy. She also received Tamoxifen therapy for 5 years.  [Slide 5] V. Recent History Recently  the patient went through a total hip replacement surgery on the right side  post which she was immobile for two weeks.  [Slide 6] VI. Conclusion Given her age  mobility history  past medical conditions  and the current presenting complaint  there was a high index of suspicion for deep vein thrombosis. The patient was diagnosed using Duplex Ultrasound which confirmed DVT in the left lower limb.     [Slide 7] VII. Management Management includes:  1. Anticoagulation: Low Molecular Weight Heparin followed by long-term treatment with oral anticoagulants (Warfarin) 2. Compression stockings 3. Regular monitoring 4. Mobilization and possibly physiotherapy  Here  the patient's past medical history influences her predisposition to DVT. Her prolonged immobility after hip surgery was the precipitating factor  acting upon the pre-existing risk factors such as cancer treatment and her age. This case illustrates the importance of vigilant risk assessment in patients with multiple comorbidities  followed by early diagnostic testing and intervention.

The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol and reports being generally sedentary due to an office job requiring long hours of sitting. He admits to lack of regular exercise. He is a married man and has two adult children. His family history does not reveal any cases of blood clot disorders.  Chief Complaint: The patient complains of pain and swelling in his left lower leg that has progressively worsened over the past week. The patient reports no history of trauma to that area. He also notes occasional shortness of breath  particularly after walking for short distances.  Presenting Vital Signs: Vital signs indicate a slightly elevated heart rate of 95 bpm  body temperature is 36.7°C  blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg  and a respiration rate of 20 breaths per minute.  Relevant Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  both of which are managed through medication. Six months ago  he underwent a right total knee arthroplasty due to severe osteoarthritis. His recovery was uneventful  and he was placed on low-dose aspirin for post-procedure protocol. He has no history of any bleeding disorders or malignancies. He also experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA) three months ago with full recovery.  Medication: The patient is currently taking atenolol for his hypertension and atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia  as well as daily low-dose aspirin.  This case combines augmented risk factors for DVT such as age  prior surgery  sedentary lifestyle  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia in a male patient. The patient’s symptoms of pain and swelling in the lower leg alongside his elevated heart rate  hypertension  TIA  shortness of breath  and recent history of knee surgery could potentially indicate the presence of DVT. However  more diagnostic tests would be required to make an accurate diagnosis.

8,6,14,diagnosis8-prompt6-trial14,Patient Profile:  Mrs. Elizabeth Thompson  a 62-year-old African American lady  presented with symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis. She is a retired school teacher  a widowed  and lives alone in uptown Chicago. Her body mass index (BMI) is 32  indicating that she is obese. She has a dual diagnosis of type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both managed with oral medication for the past ten years. Her blood pressure is generally well under control. However  her glycemic control remains poor despite treatment due to episodic non-compliance to diet regimen. She has no known allergies.  Mrs. Thompson has had two previous hospital admissions: one in 2010 for right-sided ischemic stroke with resultant left-sided weakness  from which she recovered well  and another in 2015 for a cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis. She is a former smoker  with a history of 30 pack-years but quit right after her stroke in 2010. She doesn't drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her father died at the age of 67 from complications of a stroke  and her mother passed away at the age of 72 from breast cancer.  Presenting Complaint:  She visited her primary care doctor with a 2-day history of swelling  redness  and warmth in her left calf  combined with a dull aching pain. The symptoms are exacerbated by walking and relieved by elevation. The patient denies trauma to the area  recent travel  history of venous insufficiency  or any personal or family history of DVT or PE.  Current Medications:   - Metformin 500 mg twice daily for type II Diabetes Mellitus. - Lisinopril 10 mg once daily for Hypertension. - Aspirin 81mg once daily since her stroke in 2010.  Under these circumstances  the high clinical suspicion of deep vein thrombosis requires urgent investigation using Doppler Ultrasound to confirm DVT  and appropriate medical management should commence promptly. She is at risk of pulmonary embolism; hence  the clinical team should be vigilant about any signs of dyspnea  chest pain  and hemoptysis.
8,6,15,diagnosis8-prompt6-trial15,"Problem Representation:  The subject of this case representation is a 68-year-old Caucasian male presenting with symptoms consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient reports experiencing unilateral leg pain  swelling  and redness in his left lower leg for over a week. He initially had attributed these symptoms to overexertion; however  they have gradually got worse over time.  Demographic Characteristics: The patient is a retired accountant  living in the suburbs with his wife with moderate socioeconomic status. He is a smoker  reporting a smoking history of 40 pack-years and admits to a sedentary lifestyle since retirement. Currently  he is not on any regular medication except for his occasional over-the-counter painkillers for arthritis. He claims to consume alcohol socially.  Past Medical History: The significant aspects of his past health history include hypertension (well controlled)  type 2 diabetes mellitus (controlled with diet and lifestyle changes) and osteoarthritis in his knees. He also has been hospitalized once in his late 40s for appendectomy. No known history of genetic or coagulation disorders.   Family History: Both his parents had died in their late 70s; father due to a myocardial infarction and mother due to complications from diabetes. His brother was diagnosed with DVT at the age of 70. His eldest son  who is in his early 40s  was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.  Social History: The patient's social history reveals that he is married with two adult children and four grandchildren. He is a nonsmoker and describes his alcohol use as """"moderate."""" He enjoys reading  gardening  and spending time with his family.  Lifestyle: Sedentary lifestyle post-retirement. Diet history reveals a preference for processed and convenience food  with low intake of fruits and vegetables. He does not engage in regular exercise.  Based on the patient's current symptoms  demographics  past medical history  and lifestyle  it is highly probable that his current condition is due to deep vein thrombosis. However  further investigations would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to underpin the most effective treatment plan."
8,6,16,diagnosis8-prompt6-trial16,"Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  A 66-year-old woman named Martha is a retired school teacher. She is Caucasian and lives in the Midwest with her husband of 40 years. She has been generally healthy throughout her life. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol on social occasions. She enjoys gardening and reading in her spare time.  Complaint: Recently  Martha has noticed swelling and pain in her left leg. She describes the pain as """"a dull ache"""" and notes that it becomes more pronounced when she walks. The pain tends to decrease with rest. She also observes that her left leg appears red and warmer to touch compared to her right leg.  Past Medical History: Martha has a history of hypertension  managed with Lisinopril  and she has been taking it consistently for the past decade. She was also diagnosed with obesity (BMI 30.1) two years ago  for which she tries to control with diet and moderate exercise.  Family History: There is a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in Martha's family. Her mother suffered from venous thromboembolism (VTE) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in her late sixties.  Recent Activities / Lifestyle:  Martha recently underwent a total knee arthroplasty about a month back. Post her surgery  she had been relatively less mobile and spends most of her time either seated or recumbent. After the surgery  she was put on prophylactic low molecular weight heparin which was stopped after two weeks.  Relevant Risk Factors: Martha's obesity  a recent immobility due to knee surgery  advanced age  hypertension  and a family history of DVT comprise several risk factors for developing DVT. Her complaint of the unilateral leg swelling  redness and warmth are consistent symptoms of DVT  suggesting that Martha may be presenting with this condition.  Next Steps:  The primary physician should consider scheduling diagnostic tests  such as Doppler ultrasound  D-dimer test  and perhaps venography if necessary  to confirm the suspected diagnosis of DVT. A review of her medications and management plan  considering her potential DVT diagnosis  is also warranted. The consideration of starting anticoagulants or thrombolytics  based on the results of her tests and her risk profile  could also be discussed."

8,6,22,diagnosis8-prompt6-trial22,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  turned up to the emergency department with concerns of moderate tenderness and swelling of his left leg.  Presenting Complaint -  The patient complained of a swollen and red left leg that is sensitive to touch. This condition has been coming on and off for the last four days but got aggravated overnight. Additionally  noticeable warmth in the area and difficulty in walking due to pain.  Demographics: The patient lives in an urban residential area  is married  and is a retired construction engineer.  Relevant Medical History: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease for which he had surgery three years ago. His medical history also reveals that he was diagnosed with hypertension and type II diabetes  which are under control due to medication and lifestyle changes. He has an inactive lifestyle and is overweight (BMI 30.2)  but a non-smoker and has no history of alcohol or substance abuse.  Recent Past Events: He has recently taken a cross-country road trip  in which he was mostly immobile and in a sitting position for extended hours. He had a minor surgical procedure a month ago for a hernia.  Family History: There is a family history of heart diseases and thrombotic disorders; his father died of a heart attack  and his older sister has recurrent venous thromboembolisms (VTEs).   Current Medication: He is currently on Metformin for his diabetes and Lisinopril for his hypertension.  Objective Findings: Upon examining  the patient's lower left extremity was found noticeably swollen and red with tenderness upon touch. The calf diameter was found greater on the left side compared to the right. His vitals include BP 140/90 mmHg  HR 85 bpm  RR 16 breaths per minute  T 98.6°F.  Based on these scenarios  a differential diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is considered. The presentation of the leg's symptoms  a history of peripheral vascular disease  recent surgery  sedentary lifestyle  long-distance travel  and family history supports this hypothesis. Other potential differential diagnoses  based on his symptoms  could include cellulitis  muscle strain or peripheral artery disease.   Further diagnostic testing  like D-dimer assay  ultrasound  or a venography  will help confirm the diagnosis of DVT for the patient.

Demographic Information:   John Smith is a 60- year-old Caucasian male. He lives in the city and works in a software development firm with a sedentary lifestyle. He doesn't regularly do physical activities or exercise.  History of Present Illness:  John has recently complained of moderate to severe pain and swelling in his right lower leg particularly in his calf muscle. The pain is exacerbated when he is walking or standing. He has noticed that the affected leg has become slightly red and warm.  Past Medical History:  John has a history of smoking for the last 30 years but he has reduced its frequency in the last few years. He was diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago which is well managed with antihypertensive medication. Last month  he was hospitalized for a major surgery followed by a prolonged bed rest of two weeks.  Family History:  His mother was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the past.  Review of Systems:   No complaints of chest pain  breathlessness  cough  or weight loss. No noticeable recent changes.  Relevant Risk Factors:  1. Advanced age - The risk for DVT increases with age especially after age 60. 2. Sedentary lifestyle – Lack of physical activity is a known risk factor.  3. Personal history of major surgery and prolonged immobility which can result in blood pooling in the leg veins. 4. Family history - If a blood relative has had DVT or pulmonary embolism  John might be more at risk. 5. Smoking - damages the inner lining of blood vessels and decreases anti-clotting activity.  Possible Diagnosis:  Considering John's age  symptoms  known risk factors  and past medical history  he might be suffering from Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Further diagnostic tests are needed for confirmation.  Intervention recommendation:  Refer to a vascular specialist for confirmation of the suspected diagnosis and potential anticoagulants treatment under close supervision. Lifestyle modifications including quitting smoking  keeping blood pressure under control  moving around after being stationary for a long time or post-surgery are recommended. An exercise regimen including walking  jogging  cycling  or swimming is advisable.
8,6,36,diagnosis8-prompt6-trial36,Problem Representation:  Demographic Information: The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male known to John  a physician in a suburban community hospital. He is a retired teacher  a non-smoker with a history of moderate alcohol consumption. His BMI indicates he is overweight.   Presenting Problem: The patient presents with a two-day history of unilateral leg swelling and aching heaviness in his right lower extremity that intensifies with standing or walking. The leg has a visibly red and warm area. He also mentions experiencing mild shortness of breath.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia managed with medications (lisinopril and atorvastatin respectively). He was previously hospitalized for a total hip replacement surgery on his right leg 2 weeks ago. He reports being sedentary post-surgery due to reduced mobility.

8,6,45,diagnosis8-prompt6-trial45,Problem Representation:   Demographic Information: Mrs. Madison is a 68-year-old Caucasian female who lives in Colorado. She is a non-smoker but reports occasional alcohol consumption. She is a retired school teacher and lives with her husband.   Relevant Past Medical History: Mrs. Madison has been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both controlled by medication. She was hospitalized once in her late 50s due to appendicitis and had her appendix surgically removed. Her family history reveals that her mother had a heart attack at age 75  and her grandmother suffered a stroke at 80.  Presenting Problem and Symptoms: Mrs. Madison presents with left leg swelling and discomfort which she reports has been ongoing for a week. She indicates that she recently took a long car drive and noticed the symptoms a few days after her trip. She also mentions that her left calf is visibly more swollen than the right one  and she feels a dull ache and warm sensation. She denies any chest pain  cough  or shortness of breath.  Based on the patient's history and symptoms  a possible diagnosis could be deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The extended car drive (a period of immobility)  her age  and her hypertension and diabetes contribute to her risk. Mrs. Madison will need further diagnostic tests  including D-dimer test and/or a lower extremity venous ultrasound  to confirm the diagnosis. It is also important to consider her potential risk for pulmonary embolism (PE)  given the potential life-threatening nature of this condition. In the meantime  anticoagulant medication might be initiated to prevent the progression of DVT and stop the formation of a new blood clot. Consultation with a haematologist or a vascular medicine specialist could be beneficial for Mrs. Madison.

8,6,67,diagnosis8-prompt6-trial67,Patient Representation:  Demographics: The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian female  Hanah  who is an office worker living in a suburban middle-income area. She is divorced with two grown-up children and five grandchildren.   Lifestyle: Hanah is moderately active  enjoys gardening  and sometimes walks to the local shop for her groceries. She is an ex-smoker and quit about ten years ago but has a history of heavy smoking in the past. She drinks alcohol socially and has a diet high in processed foods and sugar.   Medical History: Hanah was diagnosed with type II diabetes around six years ago and manages her condition with metformin. She has a BMI of 29. She developed hypertension four years ago  which is currently under control with the help of Lisinopril. She has a family history of cardiovascular diseases and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Her father suffered a heart attack in his sixties and her older brother had an episode of DVT after a long flight five years ago.  Presenting Problem: Over the past week  Hanah has been experiencing pain and swelling in her left leg  more specifically in her calf area. The pain seems to get worse when she walks and at the end of the day. She denies any trauma or injury to the area. She initially thought it might be muscle pain due to overexertion in the garden but saw no improvement after rest and over-the-counter painkillers. She’s also noted the skin over that area seems a bit warmer than the rest of her body. She denies having any chest pain  shortness of breath or light-headedness.  Possible Diagnosis: Based on the patient's demographics  medical history  hereditary factors  and current symptoms  possible diagnoses include Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) or possibly a Baker's Cyst. Given her history with Type II Diabetes and Hypertension  she is at higher risk for developing DVT. She needs immediate medical attention as DVT  if left untreated  can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism (PE).

8,6,94,diagnosis8-prompt6-trial94,Patient Profile:  Name: John Smith Age: 60  Gender: Male Race: Caucasian Profession: Long-haul truck driver Lifestyle: Smokes half a pack of cigarettes every day  sedentary work and lifestyle  Presenting Problem:  Mr. Smith is presenting with persistent pain and swelling of the right leg which he has noticed worsening over the past week. He is reporting suffering from intense cramping  particularly along the inner thigh and calf region. His right leg feels warmer to touch and has taken on a reddish discoloration. He also reports experiencing occasional fatigue and a faint shortness of breath.   Relevant Past Medical History:  1) Hypertension - diagnosed 10 years prior to admission  currently under control with diet and medication (Lisinopril  10 mg  once daily). 2) Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - diagnosed 8 years prior to admission  lower limb peripheral neuropathy reported  under management with insulin and dietary control. 3) Morbid obesity - BMI of 35.  4) Had abdominal surgery (Cholecystectomy) 3 years ago. 5) Family history: his father suffered from a myocardial infarction at age 62 and an uncle had Pulmonary Embolism at age 64.  This is a serious case given the potential for a Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) to dislodge and cause a Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Immediate investigation and intervention if necessary are warranted. The patient's advanced age  hypertension  DM  obesity  and sedentary lifestyle significantly contribute to his overall risk for the development and exacerbation of a DVT. His current condition is likely further complicated by his smoking habit and a genetic predisposition for vascular disease (as suggested by his family history of heart attack and PE).

Preliminary Diagnosis: Given the patient’s ongoing symptoms of unilateral leg swelling  calf pain  redness  and shortness of breath  there's a high suspicion for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that might have potentially led to a pulmonary embolism. It is compounded by her risk factors  which includes obesity  age  limited physical activity  and the use of hormonal contraception.   Further Investigation: Venous duplex ultrasound for confirmation of DVT and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for pulmonary embolism (PE) should be considered. Moreover  lab tests including complete blood count  coagulation profile  and D-dimer test might be required.   Plan: Based on the investigation results  treatment might include anticoagulation therapy. The patient should also be advised about lifestyle modification for diabetes and obesity management including regular exercise and a balanced diet. Finally  re-evaluation of the necessity of hormonal contraception in light of the present conditions should be discussed.
8,6,100,diagnosis8-prompt6-trial100,Problem Representation:  Patient Profile:  A 65-year-old female  minutes away from the rural area where she resides  came in for a consultation. She's Caucasian  moderately overweight with a BMI of 27  and lives a sedentary lifestyle working a desk job. She has a history of heavy smoking but quit ten years back. Family history shows a pattern of cardiovascular diseases which includes her mother having had a stroke at age 70.   Chief Complaint:  She expressed concerns about progressive pain and swelling in her left lower extremity for the last five days  with tenderness in the calf region which started suddenly after sitting for a prolonged period during a long car journey. The leg appears slightly redder and warmer than the right leg with moderate edema. Additionally  she reports shortness of breath experienced periodically over the past three days.  Past Medical History:  Her past medical reports show a history of hypertension  effectively managed with medication (Diuretics - Hydrochlorothiazide). Her blood pressure today is 130/85 mm Hg. No history of diabetes was noted. She had a hysterectomy about fifteen years ago due to fibroids. She is on hormone replacement therapy post-menopause.   Medication history:  Other than Hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension  she takes daily multivitamins and occasional over-the-counter painkillers for arthritis. She also takes estrogen as part of her hormone replacement therapy.  Pattern Recognition: Considering the patient's age  gender  history of prolonged immobility  hormone replacement therapy  hypertension  obesity  family history and clinical presentation such as swelling  pain  redness  warmth in one leg and shortness of breath  this pattern suggests a high suspicion of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) with a possible pulmonary embolism. The Virchow’s triad of venous stasis (long car travel)  hypercoagulability (HRT  family history of vascular conditions) and endothelial injury (age  hypertension) are all present thus increasing the likelihood of DVT.    Plans:  Possible next steps would be diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis (Duplex ultrasonography and D-Dimer test if required)  and if confirmed  medication (possibly anticoagulant therapy) and lifestyle modifications would be discussed. It's also important to rule out potential life-threatening conditions such as pulmonary embolism given her shortness of breath. More testing  such as a CT angiography  may be necessary. It is also equally important to advise her about the urgent need for smoking cessation due to her risk profile.

This case concerns a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a history of cardiovascular disease who developed DVT.  Patient information:  The patient is a 65-year-old  Caucasian gentleman  non-smoker  domiciled in rural Iowa. Professionally  he is a retired farmer  slightly overweight with a BMI of 26. He confesses to an inactive lifestyle since retirement  with less than 30 minutes of moderate physical activity per week.  Prior Medical History:  The patient has a known history of hypertension  which has been controlled with Lisinopril for the last 10 years. He also had a myocardial infarction five years ago  following which he underwent placement of drug-eluting stents for multiple coronary vessel disease. The patient was then started on Clopidogrel  a medication to hinder the formation of new clots.  Presenting Concerns: The patient presented to the outpatient department with complaints of acute onset  unilateral  painful swelling of his left lower limb. Based on clinical suspicion and D-dimer testing  the patient was suspected of having a deep vein thrombosis. An immediate lower limb venous doppler ultrasound was hence requested.  Clinical Findings: The doppler ultrasound confirmed the presence of a non-compressible segment within the left popliteal vein  consistent with the diagnosis of DVT. The patient was found to be hemodynamically stable; vital signs showed blood pressure 140/85 mmHg  heart rate 85 beats per minute  respirations 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation 98% in room air.  Intervention: The patient was promptly started on anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin alongside his Clopidogrel and was admitted for further management. Risk factor analysis noted hyperlipidemia  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and prior coronary artery disease possibly culminating in the development of DVT.  Clinical Follow-Up: During hospitalization  the patient’s symptoms improved with anticoagulant treatment. Warfarin was added to his medication regimen with a target INR of 2-3  and he was discharged home with plans for extended anticoagulation and close outpatient follow-up. Education was also provided regarding the importance of regular physical activity  diet modification  and recognizing symptoms of DVT and pulmonary embolism.  Conclusion: The case emphasizes the importance of considering DVT in patients presenting with unilateral leg swelling  especially in the presence of known risk factors such as cardiovascular disease.

8,7,10,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial10,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 64-Year-Old Female with History of Breast Cancer: A Case Report  Introduction:  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in a deep vein  usually in the leg. Risk factors can include prolonged bed rest  obesity  smoking  and certain genetic factors. Herein  we present the case of a 64-year-old female diagnosed with DVT  having a medical history of breast cancer.  Case Description:  A 64-year-old African-American female presented to the clinic with complaints of swelling  tenderness  and sudden pain in her right lower leg  which she rated as 7 on a pain scale of 0-10. She also reported difficulty in walking due to the severity of the discomfort. The patient denied history of trauma  recent long-distance travel  surgeries  or prolonged immobilization. She did  however  report a history of breast cancer (Bilateral Invasive Ductal Carcinoma) diagnosed 5 years prior  which had been successfully treated with lumpectomy and adjuvant hormonal therapy (Tamoxifen). She also reported a 30-year history of smoking  1 pack per day  and a family history of vascular diseases including DVT.   On examination  her right calf muscle circumference was 2 cm greater than the left  indicating notable swelling. Homan's sign was positive. Rest of her systemic examination was unremarkable.  Investigations:  Her D-dimer test showed elevated levels (900 ng/ml  normal being less than 500 ng/ml). The ultrasound Doppler study of the right lower extremity revealed a non-compressible popliteal vein  confirming a diagnosis of DVT. Her CT scan did not reveal any pulmonary embolism. Moreover  additional blood test results showed a high platelet count and elevated coagulation levels.   Management and Follow-up:  The patient was immediately treated with low molecular weight Heparin (Enoxaparin) and Warfarin was initiated for long term anticoagulation. The patient was admitted for monitoring. After 3 days  her pain and swelling started to decrease. Daily INR was monitored and on the fifth day  it was in a therapeutic range (2-3). Enoxaparin was then discontinued  and Warfarin therapy was continued. She was discharged on the seventh day on oral Warfarin therapy and advised to quit smoking.   The patient was closely followed up and encouraged to continue wearing compression stockings and maintain active foot/ankle exercises. On her one month follow-up  the patient reported a significant reduction in symptoms.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of vigilance in patients with a history of cancer due to their predisposition toward thromboembolic events. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent serious complications such as pulmonary embolism. This case also highlights the need for rigorous follow-up care and patient education in managing DVT  particularly in those with significant risk factors.

Other investigations – Chest and heart were normal on examination  blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg; BMI was 30.1 kg/m^2; pulse rate was 82 beats per minute.  The patient was sent to radiology for a definitive diagnosis. The doppler ultrasound of the right lower extremity showed non-compressibility of the femoral and popliteal veins  thereby confirming DVT.  Management:   She was admitted and oral anticoagulants(Factor Xa inhibitor - rivaroxaban) were started immediately with an initial dose of 15 mg twice daily for 21 days  then 20mg once daily. She was also advised to elevate her leg and use compression stockings to help reduce swelling and pain.  Conclusion:  This case demonstrates the potential risks of DVT in elderly patients with underlying comorbidities  notably cardiovascular diseases and poor lifestyle habits. Early suspicion  diagnosis  and immediate intervention of DVT play a vital role in preventing complications. It is crucial to include DVT in the differential diagnosis while dealing with patients of this demographic profile  presenting with unilateral leg swelling and pain.    Follow-Up:   The patient is scheduled for a follow-up examination in two weeks to ensure progress and manage her oral anticoagulant regimen. An assessment of her condition for post-thrombotic syndrome in later follow-ups will also be important given her age and comorbidities.

8,7,17,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial17,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis in 58-year-old Caucasian Female  Patient Information  The case patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian female  non-smoker  and non-alcoholic  with a body mass index (BMI) of 31  indicating obesity  which falls under Class 1 as per the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. She lives in a suburban community and works as a bank officer  where her work primarily involves prolonged sitting. Patient is postmenopausal and on hormone replacement therapy. There is no history of drug abuse or personal history of significant trauma or surgery. Family history is positive for cardiovascular diseases but negative for blood dyscrasias and malignancies.  Clinical Findings  Presenting symptoms included left leg pain and swelling of about a week's duration. The patient also reported a mild fever but denied chest pain  dizziness  or shortness of breath. The physical examination revealed a swollen  warm  and erythematous left lower limb. Pedal pulses were palpable  and limb ischemia was not noted.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment  A high index of suspicion led to further investigations. D-dimer level was elevated at 1500 ng/ml (normal is <500ng/ml). Ultrasonography demonstrated an occlusive thrombus in the left lower limb popliteal vein extending into the femoral vein. Pulmonary (V/Q) scan was normal  ruling out pulmonary embolism.  Past Medical History  The patient adopted a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity. She had history of recent long-haul air travel around 2 weeks prior. She was hypertensive and had been on medication (amlodipine 5 mg) for the past 5 years. Previous lab reports showed dyslipidemia controlled with statin treatment. The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus approximately 10 years ago  managed by oral hypoglycemic drugs. There was no history of liver disease  renal disease  or malignancies  and she was not on any anticoagulants prior to this event.  Therapeutic Intervention  The patient was initially put on intravenous unfractionated heparin. The dose was adjusted according to the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). As soon as the aPTT reached therapeutic levels  oral anticoagulation (warfarin) was initiated. The patient was kept on both heparin and warfarin until prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) reached therapeutic range on day 5 of admission. She was then transitioned to warfarin alone.  Discussion and Follow-Up  The patient's outcome was good after 6 months of anticoagulation therapy. Regular follow-ups ensured INR remained in a therapeutic range. Her leg swelling reduced significantly  and she was advised to wear compression stockings. Lifestyle modifications were encouraged which included adopting a balanced diet  losing weight  enhancing physical activity  and avoiding long periods of immobility.   As part of chronic care  she continues her regular medication for hypertension  type 2 diabetes  and dyslipidemia alongside the long-term anticoagulation treatment. Early detection and prompt anticoagulation treatment likely contributed to the good outcome in this case. Additionally  the case underlines the importance of considering DVT in patients presented with unilateral leg pain and swelling.   Confidential patient data were anonymized throughout this case study.

8,7,19,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial19,Patient Details: Age: 67-years old  male Race: Caucasian Occupation: Retired civil engineer Insurance: Medicare Marital Status: Married Social History: Non-smoker  moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 drinks a week)  no recreational drug use. Lives a mostly sedentary lifestyle.  Presenting Symptoms:  The patient presents with unexplained soreness and swelling in the right lower leg  which has persisted over the duration of the past week. The pain was described as a dull ache  especially noticeable when walking or standing  and there was slight reddening of the skin over the calf.  Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  which is well-managed by current treatment (Lisinopril). He underwent a total knee arthroplasty on his right knee about a month ago. He also has a sedentary lifestyle  which is likened to prolonged periods of inactivity  thereby increasing his risk for conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). There is no history of any thromboembolic events or malignancy in the past. He is not on any anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. The patient is otherwise healthy.  Examination: On examination  the right calf was slightly swollen and warm to touch with mild tenderness. No palpable cords were felt and Homan's sign was negative. There was no shortness of breath or chest pain.  Investigations: The patient underwent a Doppler ultrasound examination which confirmed the presence of a non-occlusive thrombus in the right posterior tibial vein suggesting deep vein thrombosis. Pulmonary embolism was ruled out with an EKG and chest x-ray.  Management: The patient was admitted for observation and started on subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Post evaluation of his clinical condition and potential risks  he was later transitioned to oral anticoagulants. Counseling was provided on the importance of regular ambulation.  Outcomes: Prompt recognition and initiation of anticoagulation therapy likely prevented propagation or dislodgment of the thrombosis  and a potential pulmonary embolism. The patient responded well to the treatment plan and was discharged with follow-ups arranged with the internal medicine and hematology departments.  Discussion: This case resembles the general profile of patients who get DVT. Indeed  factors like postoperative status and a sedentary lifestyle put the patient at an increased risk of DVT. It’s vital to educate such individuals about the importance of regular movement and physical exercise as a preventative measure against thrombosis.

8,7,27,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial27,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in a 42-year-old Female Post Knee Arthroplasty: A Case Report  Patient Information:  The patient is a 42-year-old Caucasian female who presented with pain and swelling in the right leg. The patient is a non-smoker and moderate alcohol consumer. She does not have any known drug allergies. Her BMI is 28.9  indicative of being overweight. She holds a desk job and has a sedentary lifestyle. The patient mentioned having a knee Arthroplasty one month prior to the new complaints.   Clinical Findings:  The patient complained of discomfort  swelling  redness  and a feeling of warmth in her right leg. Her vital signs were within normal limits except for a slightly elevated heart rate. The physical examination showed a swollen  reddened right calf that was tender to touch. She reported a sudden onset of these complaints with escalating intensity.  Medical  family  and psychosocial history:  There was no significant familial history to record. Upon taking a detailed medical history  it was revealed that the patient had undergone a total knee arthroplasty one month ago. She had been on bed rest for three weeks following the procedure. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension  being controlled by medications. Also  the patient went through two uneventful pregnancies before and during those times she did not have any clotting issues.  Diagnostic Assessment:  A D-dimer test was conducted immediately  the elevated levels of which raised suspicion for deep vein thrombosis. An ultrasound Doppler of the right leg was done which identified a blood clot in the right femoral vein confirming the diagnosis of DVT. Further tests like coagulation profiles were ordered  and they showed inherited Factor V Leiden mutation which predisposes to DVT.   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was admitted and immediately started on intravenous Heparin and later was bridged to a long-term oral anticoagulant  Warfarin. Leg elevation  compression stocking  and moderate physical activity like walking were encouraged.  Outcome and Follow-up:  The patient showed significant improvement within a week with a reduction in the swelling and pain of her leg. She was discharged with advice to continue oral anticoagulant therapy  to monitor INR levels  and was directed to follow up in the clinic after two weeks.   Discussion: This case report provides insights into the potential risk of developing DVT following orthopedic procedures like knee arthroplasty. In this patient  the post-operative immobilization  addition of obesity and hypertension with inherited Factor V Leiden mutation increased the risk. This emphasizes the importance of early mobilization  thromboprophylaxis in susceptible patients  and active monitoring for signs of DVT in post-operative patients.

Patient Information: The patient  a computer programmer by profession  had a sedentary lifestyle  primarily sitting for long periods at work. He was a non-smoker and consumed alcohol socially. His family history was significant for cardiovascular diseases (his father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 60). The patient had no known drug allergies.  Clinical findings: The patient was afebrile with blood pressure reading of 130/85 mmHg  pulse rate of 88 beats per minute (bpm)  respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. On examination  the left lower limb was erythematous  swollen with tenderness along the course of the veins. A positive Homan's sign (pain in the calf or popliteal region with abrupt dorsiflexion of the foot) was noticed.  Timeline: The patient reported gradual onset of left lower limb pain over the last seven days  which increasingly worsened two days before presentation to the hospital. There were no associated symptoms such as chest pain  difficulty in breathing  or fainting spells.  Diagnostic Assessment: The D-dimer test was positive (>500 ng/mL; normal range: 0-500 ng/mL). A subsequent duplex ultrasonography of the left lower extremity showed acute deep vein thrombosis in the left popliteal and femoral veins. There was no evidence of any free-floating thrombi. Rest of the lab investigations including coagulation profile were within normal limits.  Therapeutic intervention: The patient was started on intravenous unfractionated heparin  following which he was bridged to oral anticoagulants (Apixaban). Strict bed rest was advised along with elevation of the affected limb. He was then referred to a hematologist for further coagulation testing as an outpatient  mainly to rule out possible hereditary thrombophilias.  Follow-up and outcomes: At the one-month follow-up  the patient reported considerable improvement in his symptoms. On examination  the swelling in his leg had significantly reduced. Follow-up Doppler ultrasound showed partial recanalization of the thrombosed veins. The patient was encouraged to maintain a more active lifestyle and to continue the oral anticoagulants as recommended by the hematologist.

8,7,31,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial31,Case Report:   Demographics:  The patient is a 54-year-old Caucasian male  who works as a tech consultant. He is married with two children and lives in an urban area.   Presenting Symptoms:  The patient initially presented to the emergency department with severe pain in his left leg  which had been increasing over the course of a few days. The pain was primarily located in his calf and had gradually become accompanied by significant swelling. He also noticed that his left leg turned slightly blue.  Past Medical History:  The patient had a past history of major orthopedic surgery  specifically a left hip replacement  which occurred about two months prior to this incident. The surgical recovery had been uneventful  and the patient gradually resumed his normal activities. There were no known allergies or adverse reactions to drugs. The patient has a history of being a smoker for around 15 years but quit five years ago. His family history includes a father and an elder brother who suffered from coronary heart disease in their late fifties. Other medical history includes occasional stress-related migraines and moderate Hypercholesterolemia  which is managed through dietary changes.  Investigation & Diagnosis:  After clinical examination  a Doppler ultrasound was performed which showed a large thrombus in the left popliteal vein  confirming a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Treatment & Follow-up:  The patient was immediately admitted and started on a course of anticoagulant therapy. Heparin was administered first  followed by oral Warfarin  monitoring the International Normalized Ratio (INR) closely. Post two weeks  patient’s leg pain and swelling had nearly disappeared. After leaving the hospital  the patient continued with a course of prophylactic treatment with Warfarin to prevent other thrombi from forming and was evaluated for a potential thrombophilic condition. The patient was instructed to avoid prolonged periods of immobility  and work by standing or walking intermittently.  Conclusions:  This case highlights the risk of DVT associated with a post-operative state  prolonged immobility  and potential genetic predisposition. In patients with prior orthopedic surgery  physicians should discuss the susceptibility to DVT  signs to watch for  and preventive measures to take to lower their risk. It is essential to remind these patients of the need for prompt medical attention if any symptoms suggestive of DVT occur. Davidson's Principles and Practice of Medicine recommends a DVT risk assessment for all patients admitted to hospital  and our patient will be included in our own study to determine the utility of such an assessment.   Patient's Consent:  A written informed consent for publication was obtained from the patient for this case report and any accompanying images.

The pain was severe and described as a dull aching soreness.   History of Present Illness He also mentioned about a feeling of warmness in the same area of the leg. Mr. A reported having been largely sedentary for the previous two weeks due to a bad winter weather  which resulted in him staying indoors most of the time.  Medical History Mr. A has a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he is on Metformin  and Hypertension  being treated with Lisinopril. There was no history of smoking  alcohol or substance abuse. He also did not report any family history of blood clotting disorders. However  he did mention that he took a long-haul flight about a month ago.  Physical Examination Upon examination  patient was in visible distress due to pain. His blood pressure was 145/90 mm Hg  heart rate 89 beats/min  with a regular rhythm and his weight was recorded as 102 kg. The right lower limb was significantly swollen  erythematous and tender on palpation  especially in the calf area. There were no palpable cords or visible superficial venous dilation. No deformity  scarring or skin changes were noted.  Laboratory Findings Lab investigations revealed elevated D-dimer levels indicative of thrombosis. Complete blood count  liver and renal function tests were within acceptable limits. Blood sugar level was elevated consistent with his history of diabetes. Electrocardiogram (EKG) did not reveal any acute abnormalities.  Imaging Color Doppler ultrasound of the right leg was performed  indicating the existence of a noncompressible segment in the femoral and popliteal veins consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Treatment Mr. A was admitted to the hospital and treated with anticoagulant therapy (low molecular weight heparin initially  transitioning to Warfarin)  along with medications specific for his diabetes and hypertension.   Outcome and Follow-Up His leg swelling significantly decreased and pain was controlled after started on anticoagulants. His DVT was most likely associated with prolonged immobility and history of long-haul travel with diabetes and hypertension as possible risk factors.

8,7,37,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial37,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 58-year-old Caucasian male: A Case Report  Introduction: A 58-year-old Caucasian male patient  weighing around 90 kg and standing 1.75 m tall was presented in the ER  complaining about acute onset of pain  swelling  and redness in the right lower extremity.  Demographics: The patient  a smoker with a 40-pack annual history  is a known case of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  managed with insulin for the past 15 years. He also carries a history of chronic back pain for which he is under chiropractic care and occasionally uses NSAIDs. The patient  an accountant by profession  leads a sedentary lifestyle and denied any history of recent long-duration travels or surgeries.  Clinical Findings: On initial examination  the patient's right leg was visibly edematous and warm to touch compared with the left  with some signs of erythema present. Vitals showed a mildly elevated blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg  heart rate of 90 beats per minute (BPM) and respiratory rate at 20 breaths per minute (BRM) with a temperature of 98.6°F. His heart sounds were normal as was his lung examination.   Diagnostic Assessment: Lab results demonstrated an elevated D-Dimer at 800 ng/mL (Normal <500 ng/mL). Given the patient's history and clinical presentation  he was strongly suspected for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A Doppler ultrasound was performed  which confirmed the presence of a clot in the lower segment of the right femoral vein  thus confirming the diagnosis of DVT.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initiated on anticoagulation therapy using low-molecular-weight heparin with a transition to oral factor Xa inhibitor for longer-term management. The patient was also advised regular ambulation and use of compression stockings for symptom management.  Follow-Up: The patient responded well to the provided treatment. At the 1-month follow-up visit  a repeat Doppler ultrasound showed significant reduction in clot size and the patient reported a notable improvement in pain and swelling.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of recognizing DVT in outpatients  particularly those with risk factors like advanced age  sedentary lifestyle  smoking  and prior history of venous thromboembolism. Early recognition  diagnosis  and treatment primarily aimed at anticoagulation can mitigate the risk of fatal complications  such as pulmonary embolism.

His vital signs were as follows: temperature – 37.8-degree Celsius  pulse – 88 beats per minute  blood pressure- 145/90mmHg  and respiratory rate- 18 breaths per minute.  3. Past Medical History:  Mr. Hart is a non-smoker with a history of hypertension controlled with medication  namely Amlodipine 5mg daily. He is also being treated for hypercholesterolemia with Simvastatin 20mg daily. He was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 3 years ago and managed with lifestyle modifications and Metformin. He underwent a total knee replacement surgery on the same leg around two months ago.   4. Diagnostic Assessment:  Doppler ultrasound of the left leg was performed  which revealed a non-compressible segment in the left popliteal vein  supportive of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Lab results showed an elevated D-dimer level of 800 ng/mL (normal range: 0-500 ng/mL)  while other markers like complete blood count (CBC)  liver function test (LFT)  and renal panel were within normal limits.  5. Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was started on parenteral Anticoagulants - low molecular weight Heparin (Enoxaparin 1mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours). After five days  the treatment strategy was transitioned to an oral anticoagulant - Warfarin (5mg/day)  considering his medical history.  6. Follow-up:  Mr. Hart was advised regarding the importance of medication compliance  potential signs of complications (like chest pain  shortness of breath)  and the need for regular follow-up appointments. A repeat ultrasound will be scheduled in one month to assess the resolution of the clot. Lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise  a healthy diet  and maintaining optimal body weight were also emphasized.  7. Conclusion:   The high risk of DVT in this case is multifactorial  including underlying comorbidities (hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  diabetes)  advanced age  and recent major surgery. A multidisciplinary care approach and patient compliance in long-term anticoagulation therapy will be pivotal in preventing recurrence or complications of DVT in this patient.

He is a retired construction worker living in a suburban community with his wife. The patient is a non-smoker and reports moderate alcohol intake.   History of Present Illness:  The patient presented to the emergency department with a 48-hour history of progressively worsening pain and swelling in the right lower extremity. No history of trauma or recent travel was reported. There was no fever  chest pain  dyspnea  hemoptysis  or history of prior similar episodes.   Past Medical History:  The patient previously survived a myocardial infarction five years prior and had been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus over the past decade. No history of any psychiatric illness  cancer  pulmonary disease  renal disease or liver disease was elicited. He never had any surgeries or hospitalizations.   Current Medications and Allergies:  The patient has been on a stable regimen of aspirin  metformin  and lisinopril. He is allergic to penicillin  which causes a rash.  Physical Examination:  On examination  the patient was afebrile  blood pressure was 132/84 mm of Hg  pulse rate 78 beats per minute  respiration 18 per minute  and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. A noticeable swelling of the right calf (3 cm more in diameter compared to left calf) was observed along with tenderness on palpation. No superficial venous varicosities or skin changes were noted. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.  Diagnostic Assessment:  D-Dimer levels were elevated. Subsequently  an ultrasound of the right lower extremity confirmed a deep vein thrombosis in the femoral vein. Chest X-ray and ECG did not reveal any abnormalities.

She is a retired high school teacher  non-smoker  and reports occasional alcohol consumption. She is widowed  living alone  and has two adult children who live within the same region.  Medical History  The patient has a significant medical history including hypertension controlled with Lisinopril and Amlodipine  type 2 diabetes managed with Metformin  and hypercholesterolemia treated with Rosuvastatin. She has a history of hypothyroidism which is currently regulated with Levothyroxine. She also had a hysterectomy due to fibroids at the age of 52. She hasn't had any prior surgeries or hospitalizations.  Presenting Symptoms  The patient came to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of swelling  warmth  and pain in the left lower extremity. She also reported difficulty walking due to the discomfort. On questioning  she reported feeling short of breath and fatigued for the past few days  but associated it with her age and did not pursue medical evaluation.  Clinical Findings  On examination  her left leg showed notable edema  warmth  and tenderness along the inner side. Her vitals were stable although her heart rate was slightly elevated at 98 bpm. There was no palpable cord  and Homan's sign was equivocal. Her lungs were clear to auscultation and her heart sounds were regular with no added sounds.  Diagnosis  Given her complaints and physical examination findings  a venous Doppler ultrasound was performed urgently which revealed a thrombus in the left popliteal vein suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A CT pulmonary angiogram was also performed  due to her reported shortness of breath and slightly elevated heart rate  which did not show any evidence of pulmonary embolism.  Treatment  The patient was promptly started on low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) with plans to bridge her to an oral anticoagulant  likely Apixaban or Rivaroxaban  once her renal tests return as suitable. She was provided education regarding the importance of compliance with her anticoagulation therapy and other risk reduction strategies.  The patient was also referred for a thrombophilia workup in the outpatient setting to rule out any underlying pro-thrombotic state. Her medications were reviewed and no potential contributors to her DVT were identified.  Patient's Progress  At her two-week follow-up at the thrombosis clinic  she reported significant improvement in her symptoms of leg swelling and discomfort. Her outpatient thrombophilia workup did not reveal any hereditary or acquired thrombotic disorders suggesting her DVT was likely provoked by her sedentary lifestyle  particularly during the recent COVID-19 lockdown.  She has been regularly followed up in the internal medicine clinic since then to monitor her progress and to manage her comorbid conditions.

Diagnostic Assessment:  A Doppler ultrasound was performed  confirming the presence of a clot in the left popliteal vein indicating a deep vein thrombosis. His complete blood count (CBC)  liver function tests (LFTs)  and kidney function tests (KFTs) were within normal limits. However  his lipid profile was deranged with raised LDL levels.   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was immediately started on anticoagulants (low weight molecular heparin) and further advised to switch to oral anticoagulants (Warfarin). He was counseled regarding the importance of exercise  weight loss  and smoking cessation. The use of compression stockings was suggested to reduce symptoms and decrease the risk of complications.   Outcome:  The patient experienced significant relief from pain within 2 days of the treatment. A follow-up after 1 month showed reduced swelling  increased mobility  and the absence of Homan's sign. The patient successfully reduced his smoking habit and began making efforts towards a healthier lifestyle.   Conclusions:  This case underscores the role of a sedentary lifestyle and other risk factors like smoking  obesity  and family history of cardiovascular disorders in the formation of deep vein thrombosis. Regular exercise  healthy eating habits  and smoking cessation are crucial for people having these risk factors to prevent DVT. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment play a vital role in preventing morbidity and mortality.
8,7,52,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial52,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 67-year-old Male with Past Medical history of Smoking  I. Patient Information   The patient is a 67-year-old Caucasian male  retired  and residing in the suburban Midwest. He lives with his wife of 45 years  has two adult children  and four grandchildren. He is a former smoker  having clocked 45 pack-years before quitting two years ago.  II. Chief Complaint   The patient presented at the clinic with a two-day history of severe pain and progressive swelling in the right lower extremity with no discernible injury.   III. History of Present Illness   The patient complained of pain in the right leg  primarily in the calf region with a scoring of 8 out of 10 on a pain rating scale. He had observed swelling for two days and noticed that the mobility of his right leg was restricted due to pain. He reported no associated fever  chest pain  or dyspnea. However  he did recall instances of occasional cramps in the same leg over the past week.  IV. Past Medical History    The patient had a medical history of hypertension for which he had been taking medication regularly for the past ten years. He has also been treated for hypercholesterolemia for the past five years and recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus which is being managed by oral hypoglycemic agents. Previously  he had undergone gastric ulcer surgery about fifteen years ago. He admitted to tobacco use  with 45 pack-years history  though he had quit about two years back  inspired by cessation counseling. He also consumes alcohol moderately.  V. Physical Examination   On physical examination  his height is 5 feet 11 inches and his weight is 200lbs (BMI 27.8kg/m2)  suggesting he is overweight. His blood pressure is 135/85 and pulse rate is 80 beats/min. His right lower extremity was erythematous  warm  substantially swollen  and tender  particularly in the calf region. Pulses were palpable. Rest of the systemic examination is normal.  VI. Relevant Test Results   The D-dimer test was elevated and an ultrasound Doppler study of the right lower extremity confirmed the presence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the proximal veins.   VII. Treatment   The patient was immediately started on subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin along with oral rivaroxaban. He was also advised to elevate his leg and use compression stockings to alleviate swelling.  VIII. Follow-up and Prognosis   The patient is currently being monitored closely for any worsening of symptoms or side effects from the anticoagulation therapy. The patient was educated about the signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism  as an extension of deep vein thrombosis.  IX. Learning points   This case highlights that elderly patients  especially those with multiple risk factors including history of smoking  hypertension  dyslipidemia  obesity  and recent onset of diabetes are at a higher risk for developing deep vein thrombosis. Practitioners must consider these risk factors and have a high index of suspicion for DVT in patients presenting with unilateral leg pain/swelling. Effective treatment and thorough patient education can potentially prevent severe complications such as pulmonary embolism.
8,7,53,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial53,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 65-Year-Old Male Patient  Patient Information:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male who presents with symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his left lower leg.   Demographics:  He is a retired engineer  a non-smoker who drinks alcohol moderately. He lives with his wife and has a supportive home environment. He denied any drug use.  Medical History: Patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes and under medication control with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Metformin respectively. He also has a family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 62. The patient also reports that he had an aunt who was diagnosed with a blood clot in her leg when she was in her seventies.  Physical Examination: During the physical examination  the patient’s vital signs were relatively stable  showing a normal respiratory rate and a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. On inspection  his left leg was observed to be swollen and visibly larger than the right leg. Upon palpation  the patient indicated that he experienced tenderness in the area.  Clinical Findings: The patient reported symptoms of swelling and pain in his left lower leg  which has been progressing over the last 5 days. He didn’t report any recent surgeries  long term sitting or periods of immobility. No other symptoms were reported at the time of consultation.  Diagnostic Assessment: Based on the patient's symptoms  a venous duplex ultrasound was conducted which confirmed the presence of a clot in the deep vein of the left calf. Lab tests including a complete blood count  D-dimer test  and PT/INR were ordered. D-Dimer level came out to be elevated  which further supported the diagnosis of DVT.  Therapeutic Intervention: Anticoagulant therapy was initiated with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) for immediate anticoagulation along with oral Warfarin. Overlapping therapy was planned for the initial 5 days till the time INR reached a therapeutic range of 2-3. During the in-hospital phase  the patient was encouraged to ambulate.  Follow-up and Outcomes: A follow-up appointment was arranged in 2 weeks to reassess the clot and ensure the patient's response to treatment. The patient was also given advice on risk factor modification  weight management  and lifestyle changes to prevent future episodes of DVT.  Patient Perspective: The patient expressed relief after the diagnosis was made and anticoagulant therapy was initiated. His main concern was the prevention of future episodes  and he was eager to make necessary lifestyle changes for the same.  Informed consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publishing this case report.
8,7,54,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial54,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 45-Year Old Caucasian Male  Patient Information:  A 45-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. B  visited the clinic with complaints of persistent pain and swelling in the right lower extremity. His occupation as a software engineer involves long sitting hours. His BMI was noted to be 28.5 indicating overweight. He is a non-smoker and has a moderate alcohol intake of approximately one to two drinks per week. His past medical history included hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with lisinopril and atorvastatin respectively. He had no known allergies or family history of venous thromboembolic disease.  Clinical Findings:  On physical examination  the patient's right calf was markedly swollen and warm to touch with a notable redness. Homan's sign was positive (pain in the calf upon dorsiflexion of his foot).   Diagnostic Assessment:  We suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  due to the patient's clinical presentation  sedentary occupation  and his hypertension and hyperlipidemia which are known predisposing factors for DVT. Loss of pulsation in the dorsalis pedis and popliteal arteries were noted. Doppler ultrasonography was ordered and confirmed the presence of a thrombus within the right posterior tibial vein. A D-dimer test was positive with a level of 950 ng/ml (normal range: up to 500 ng/ml).  Therapeutic Intervention:  Anticoagulant therapy was immediately initiated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). He was later bridged to oral apixaban  a Factor Xa inhibitor  which he is to take for at least three months. His leg was also elevated to reduce swelling and he was advised to wear compression stockings. Exercise and mobilization were encouraged.   Follow Up and Outcomes:  He was asked to return to the clinic for regular follow-ups  focusing on assessment of symptom resolution  monitoring of potential bleeding complications  or development of post-thrombotic syndrome. On his return after a week  there was a significant reduction in the swelling of his right lower limb  and after four weeks  the patient reported complete resolution of the previous symptoms.   Teaching Points:  This case underscores the importance of considering DVT while evaluating leg or calf pain with swelling especially in patients with known risk factors. Morbidity and Mortality from DVT can be greatly reduced by appropriate and timely intervention. Individuals with sedentary jobs should be counseled about the potential risks and advised to take frequent short breaks to mobilize. Regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight are also pivotal in prevention of DVT.  
8,7,55,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial55,Patient Information:  Ms. Judy Garner  a 63-year-old Caucasian female  presented with abrupt and severe pain in her left calf.  Presenting Issue:   The client reported alarming swelling accompanied with warmth and redness around the affected area. The pain amplified significantly while standing or moving. There were no associated symptoms  such as breathlessness  cough  hemoptysis  or chest pain.  Medical History:   Ms. Garner has a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus  which is managed with insulin and dietary modifications. Her hypertension is controlled through a daily low-dose of ACE inhibitor. She is also on a low dose of statins for hyperlipidemia. The patient has reported no previous episodes of similar nature. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. She reported a recent long car journey (continuous driving for about 10-12 hours each day)  which had happened about six days prior to the onset of symptoms.  On examination  her Body Mass Index (BMI) was 29.5 kg/m2  and all peripheral pulses were palpable and symmetric. No surface veins were visible  but the left calf was significantly swollen relative to the right.   Investigations:  Laboratory data revealed deranged coagulation profile with D-dimer of 1500 ng/mL (normal range: 0:243 ng/mL). She exhibited no leukocytosis  anemia  or signs of bacterial infection. Venous Doppler ultrasound of the left lower extremity revealed acute thrombus in the popliteal and femoral veins  indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). There were no signs of any peripheral arterial disease on angiography. Echocardiography and pulmonary angiogram were normal ruling out any pulmonary embolism.  Management and Outcome:  The patient was hospitalized and treated with Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) initially and then overlapped with Warfarin. Tear hose was initiated for compression. Regular lab monitoring and follow-ups were encouraged. Her insulin was adjusted to maintain sugar in the desired range  and blood pressure was managed appropriately. After a course of seven days  her symptoms started to decrease. She was counseled regarding the importance of regular follow-ups  lifestyle modifications  and the necessity for compliance with medication. She was discharged with advice for a regular checkup and further evaluation.   Discussion:  The long duration of the recent car journey  without moving around may have contributed to the occurrence of a DVT  given the patient's existing co-morbidities leading to a hypercoagulable state. Education about the need for ambulation during long transit is necessary for such patient categories.   This case demonstrates the importance of evaluating for DVT in patients with unexplained extremity pain and swelling  especially in the setting of known risk factors such as prolonged immobility  obesity  advanced age  diabetes  and hypertension.

Her heart rate was 88 beats per minute  blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg  respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.  Diagnostic Assessment:   A complete blood count showed slight leukocytosis (White Blood Cells- 11 000/µL) but no other abnormalities. Coagulation parameters were within normal limits. A venous duplex ultrasound was performed on her lower extremities  which showed acute thrombosis of the left femoral vein.   Therapeutic Intervention:   Anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was started. The patient was transitioned to an oral anticoagulant  rivaroxaban  to be taken for six months. The patient was advised to stop using oral contraceptives and to cease smoking.   Follow-Up and Outcomes:   At one month follow-up  the patient reported significant reduction in the leg pain and the swelling. A follow-up ultrasound done at 3 months showed resolution of the clot in the femoral vein. She has quit smoking and has switched from oral contraceptives to a non-hormonal method of birth control.   Patient Perspective:   """"The whole episode was scary  but I am relieved to see the improvement now. I have decided to quit smoking and realized how important it is to move around especially when I am sitting for long hours during work.""""  Discussion:  This case highlights the importance of recognizing risk factors for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  such as long haul travel  oral contraceptive use  sedentary lifestyle  and smoking. Patient education on modifiable risk factors is essential for prevention and management of DVT. It also brings attention to the necessity of early recognition and treatment of DVT to prevent complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome and Pulmonary Embolism (PE). "
8,7,57,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial57,Title: Acute Onset of Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Female  Patient Information: Mrs. S.  a 52-year-old Caucasian female  presented to the emergency department out-of-the-blue with complaints of acute onset swelling and pain in her left lower limb. She reported no history of trauma  injury  or recent surgical procedures.   Medical History: She has a known history of Stage 2 Hypertension  which is being managed with a beta-blocker (Metoprolol). Her BMI was recorded at about 30  indicating obesity. Mrs. S. is a former cigarette smoker and quit around 3 years ago. She does not consume alcohol and does not have any known drug allergies.   She also has a significant family history as her father and grandmother both experienced episodes of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and her mother had a stroke in her early 70s.  Clinical Findings and Diagnostics: On physical examination  her left leg was significantly more swollen  erythematous  warm to touch  with mild tenderness than her right leg. Ultrasound Doppler investigation of the left lower limb confirmed a thrombus lodged in the left popliteal vein  and signs of acute DVT. Coagulation panels were unremarkable  and Basic Metabolic Panel findings were within normal range.  Treatment: Considering the patient's clinical presentation and ultrasound findings  she was immediately started on a therapeutic dose of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as anticoagulation therapy.   Patient's Course: Over the course of a week  with consistent administration of LMWH  Mrs. S. experienced a significant decrease in pain and swelling. The patient was transitioned to oral Factor Xa inhibitor (Rivaroxaban) for long term anticoagulation. She was counseled about the importance of lifestyle modifications  including the need for weight reduction  healthy diet  and regular exercise to manage her hypertension and obesity  which would also aid in preventing recurrent DVT.  Conclusion: Management of DVT is multifactorial and requires individual assessment. This case emphasizes the importance of systematic and comprehensive risk factor evaluation and an individualized approach to prevent recurrence. Furthermore  it demonstrates that despite no triggering events  a predisposing risk factor such as a family history of DVT  along with other factors  in this case  hypertension and obesity  could result in DVT. The role of primary care physicians in recognizing potential risk factors is vital for the prompt diagnosis and management of DVT.
8,7,58,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial58,Title: A Case of Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Postpartum Female  Patient Demographics:  - Age: 32 - Sex: Female  - Race: African American - Occupation: Office worker - Location: New Jersey  Clinical History: The patient was in good health until 2 weeks postpartum  when she started experiencing persistent pain and swelling in her right calf. The pain was dull  aching  and was more pronounced on standing and walking. There was no history of trauma  fever  constitutional symptoms  or any calf muscle cramps. The patient reported a history of three uncomplicated pregnancies with vaginal deliveries and did not have any significant medical history. She denied any family history of blood clots.  Clinical Examination: On physical examination  the patient appeared to be in mild distress due to pain. The vital signs were normal. General and systemic examination revealed no significant findings. Lower extremity examination revealed that her right calf was swollen  erythematous  and warm to touch. There was tenderness on deep palpation with a positive Homan's sign.  Investigations: Laboratory investigations revealed slightly elevated D-dimer levels. Other investigations including CBC  LFTs  RFTs  coagulation profile were within normal limits. A Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremity revealed a non-compressible right popliteal vein suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Management: She was admitted and started on subcutaneous enoxaparin. On the second day  oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban was added. Following 5 days of hospitalization  her symptoms alleviated. She was discharged on a continuing course of rivaroxaban  with follow-up appointments and instructions to observe for any signs of pulmonary embolism.  Summary: This case highlights the importance of considering a diagnosis of DVT in postpartum women presenting with unilateral leg pain and swelling. As pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state  this group has a relatively high risk of venous thrombosis. Early suspicion  prompt investigation and initiation of anticoagulant therapy can prevent complications like pulmonary embolism  and long-term sequelae such as post-thrombotic syndrome.
8,7,59,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial59,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in A Post-Menopausal Woman with Past History of Prolonged Immobility  Patient Information: A 62-year-old Caucasian woman presented at our outpatient clinic reporting intermittent pain and noticeable swelling in her right calf over the past week. The patient  a retired office worker  lives alone and is a non-smoker with no known allergies. She is not on any form of regular medication but was taking over-the-counter painkillers for the presenting issue.  Past Medical History: The patient has a previously diagnosed history of osteoarthritis  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. She underwent a total right knee replacement surgery about a month ago. The surgery was uncomplicated  with the patient having a slightly delayed recovery due to limited mobility and difficulty adhering to postsurgical physical therapy. Besides  there is no family history of venous thromboembolism or other hematological disorders.  Clinical Findings: Physical examination revealed a moderately tender right calf with edema and erythema. The Homans sign was negative  but the prudential sign was positive. No other specific signs or symptoms were noted. The patient's blood pressure was slightly elevated  at 150/80 mmHg  and other vitals were within normal ranges.  Diagnostic Assessment: Given the degree of swelling  pain  prolonged immobilization after knee surgery  and her risk factors such as age  hyperlipidemia  and hypertension  a preliminary diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was made. A venous Doppler ultrasound of the right lower limb was ordered  which confirmed the presence of a nonocclusive thrombus in the distal femoral vein.  Therapeutic Intervention: The patient was initiated on therapeutic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and advised to elevate the affected leg. An elastic compression stocking was also recommended. After five days  the patient was switched to oral anticoagulation therapy (rivaroxaban) for long-term management.  Follow-Up and Outcomes: At her one-month follow-up  the patient reported significant symptom improvement with a noticeable reduction in leg swelling and pain. A repeat Doppler ultrasound confirmed the successful reduction in the size of the thrombus. Her anticoagulant therapy will be continued for three months with periodic monitoring.   Conclusions: This case underscores the importance of recognizing DVT as a potential complication in individuals with prolonged immobilization  especially post-surgically. Its prompt diagnosis and management could prevent serious complications like pulmonary embolism.

He is a current smoker (25 pack-years) and keeps a sedentary lifestyle. He also has a family history of cardiovascular diseases with both parents dying from heart stroke in their late 50s. There is no history of any drug or alcohol abuse. He is also diagnosed with obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 34. The patient's presumed exposure to risk factors includes prolonged immobility due to frequent long-distance travels for work.  Examinations & Investigations: Physical examination revealed left lower leg swelling and redness  tenderness on palpation  and raised local temperature. Lab results showed prolonged PT (Prothrombin Time) and aPTT (Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time) as well as elevated D-Dimer levels  indicating a probable blood clot. Ultrasound of the left leg showed a non-compressible left popliteal vein which is highly suggestive of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  Differential Diagnoses:  Cellulitis  calf muscle tear  Baker's cyst  Peripheral Artery Disease  Treatment: This patient was treated with a therapeutic dose of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) followed by oral anticoagulation therapy (Warfarin) for the long-term to prevent recurrent DVT and pulmonary embolism. He was also advised to elevate his leg to reduce swelling and was given graduated compression stockings. Lifestyle modification  smoking cessation  and weight loss were also advised to better manage his hypertension and prevent any potential cardiometabolic risk.  Outcome: Patient followed up after 1 month with reduced leg swelling and pain. However  he continued to struggle with smoking cessation and weight loss. Hence  he was referred to dieticians and psychologists for further management.  Learning Points: Early diagnosis and management of DVT are crucial to prevent fatal complications like Pulmonary Embolism. A sedentary lifestyle and smoking remain significant modifiable risk factors for DVT. The case underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach involving drug therapy  lifestyle modifications  and psychological commitment in the long-term management of such conditions. Medical practitioners should monitor such patients closely for effective treatment and prevention of any potential complications.

8,7,75,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial75,Title: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 65-year-old Male with a Medical History of Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus  Introduction: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) refers to the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein  predominantly in the legs. Common risk factors include prolonged immobility  prolonged bed rest  recent surgery  cancer  oral contraceptives  and previous history of DVT.  Case presentation: A 65-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with complaints of progressive swelling and pain in his right lower leg for the past three days. The patient reported the pain as being more severe when walking and somewhat relieved with rest. He denied any recent history of trauma  surgery  long duration travels  or a sedentary lifestyle.  The patient's medical history included Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  which was adequately controlled with metformin  and hypertension that was managed with losartan. He weighed around 87 kilograms and had a height of 1.75 meters (BMI: 28.4  indicating overweight). He was a former smoker and had quit smoking ten years prior. His family history was significant for myocardial infarctions in both parents.  Clinical findings: The physical examination revealed a swollen  erythematous right lower extremity that was notably warmer to touch compared to the other leg. No obvious deformity or surgical wounds were noted. A palpable cord along the line of a vein was not detected. His blood pressure was controlled at 130/80 mmHg  his heart rate was 78 beats per minute  and his oxygen saturation was within normal limits.  Diagnostic assessment: A venous duplex ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of a proximal deep vein thrombosis in the right lower extremity. Blood investigations revealed  among other findings  increased D-dimer levels (1100 ng/ml) which is indicative of active clot degradation. His glucose and lipid profiles were moderately controlled.  Therapeutic intervention: The patient was initiated on low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin  1 mg/kg) subcutaneously twice daily and oral Rivaroxaban (15 mg twice a day). Diabetic and hypertensive medication regimen was continued.  Follow-up and outcomes: After five days of hospital stay  the patient was discharged with Rivaroxaban for six months and instructed to maintain control over diabetes and hypertension. He was informed about the signs of Pulmonary embolism and Post Thrombotic Syndrome and was advised to return immediately if any of such symptoms were noted. Follow-up visits were scheduled.  Conclusion: This case underlines the importance of early detection and treatment of deep vein thrombosis  especially in patients with risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. Even in the absence of significant predisposing factors like immobility  obesity  or recent surgery  DVT can occur. Further attention and research are needed to enhance our understanding of the correlation between DVT  hypertension  diabetes  and other possible risk factors.

His medications document metformin  lisinopril  and low-dose aspirin. He had also undergone bypass surgery post his Myocardial Infarction.  II. Presenting Complaint:  The patient reported sudden onset of sharp  non-radiating pain in his left calf for the past 48 hours. He noted visible swelling in his lower left leg  which was getting progressively worse. He did not report any trauma  injury  or recent travel where he could have been immobile for long periods.  III. Clinical Findings:  Physical examination revealed a visibly swollen  warm  red  and tender left lower leg. The patient was vitals-stable with a slightly elevated blood pressure (145/90 mmHg). Examination of the heart and lungs were normal. However  an absent left pedal pulse was noted.   IV Laboratory Investigations:  The patient's blood investigations revealed a D-Dimer of 1500 ng/mL (Normal: <500 ng/mL)  random blood glucose levels were 190 mg/dL (Normal: 140-199 mg/dL)  and serum creatinine levels were 1.5 mg/dL (Normal: 0.6-1.2 mg/dL). Elevated D-Dimer with an increase in swelling and pain pointed towards a probable deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   V. Diagnostic Assessment:  The patient's clinical picture prompted further investigation with a Doppler Ultrasound. The ultrasound showed non-compressibility of the left posterior tibial vein and femoral vein and also a thrombus which confirmed a diagnosis of left lower limb DVT.  VI. Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was administered unfractionated heparin as an acute management strategy. Oral anticoagulation therapy with Warfarin was initiated.   VII. Follow-Up:  On a two-week follow-up  the swelling and pain had significantly reduced. He was advised to continue oral anticoagulação and follow-up regularly.  In summary  in light of the patient’s medical history and the results of his investigations  acute left lower limb DVT was diagnosed.

The patient is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol only occasionally. There is no history of inherited hypercoagulant states or venous thromboembolism in the family.   Evaluation and Diagnosis:  Physical examination revealed localized warmth  erythema  swelling  and tenderness over her left calf. Differential diagnosis possibilities at the point included cellulitis  hematoma  and DVT. The patient was fibrile with temperature of 100.5 F. Laboratory findings displayed slightly elevated D-dimer levels  normal platelet count  and normal activated partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times.  Further investigation via a Doppler ultrasound confirmed the clinical suspicion of DVT  showing an acute clot in the left posterior tibial and peroneal veins. Her Wells score was calculated to be 4  indicating a moderate risk for DVT.  Management and Follow-up:  The patient was admitted to the medical ward for close monitoring and was initiated on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as per the protocol for acute DVT management. Her condition improved significantly over the course of a week.   She was discharged on oral anticoagulant Rivaroxaban with scheduled follow-up in the outpatient clinic. She was informed about the disease process  possible complications and importance of adhering to the treatment regime. The patient was also instructed to mobilize and regular exercise to enhance venous return.  Conclusion:  This case underscores the importance of considering DVT in our differential diagnosis for patients presenting with unilateral leg pain and swelling  even in the absence of classical risk factors. An early diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulation treatment are vital in preventing complications such as pulmonary emboli.
8,7,79,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial79,Title: A Case Report on Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Male with History of Prolonged Immobility  Patient Description:  The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian male who presented at the emergency department complaining of persistent pain and swelling in his left lower leg. His condition had worsened over the past week. Upon physical examination  the left calf appeared swollen  tender  and warm to touch with spots of redness and slight discoloration.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of Type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and elevated cholesterol levels. He does not smoke or consume alcohol regularly. He had been following a regimen of oral hypoglycemic agents  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  and statins. He had a myocardial infarction five years ago  for which he underwent successful coronary artery bypass grafting. Post-surgery  he had been on aspirin therapy. His family history is significant with his father having suffered from stroke secondary to chronic hypertension.  Current Presentation: Two weeks ago  the patient had a motor vehicle accident  resulting in a left hip fracture. The patient underwent orthopedic surgery and since then had been largely immobilized  using crutches only for essential movements. At present  the patient is not experiencing any chest pain or shortness of breath.   Diagnostic Assessment: An ultra-sonogram was performed on the left leg  which revealed an occlusive thrombus in the left popliteal vein  confirming the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). His D-dimer test was positive  further suggesting the presence of a clot. There were no abnormalities detected on chest x-ray or ECG.   Clinical Course: Given the diagnosis  the patient was immediately started on parenteral anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin and bridged to warfarin for long-term prevention of thrombus propagation. He was also advised to use compression stockings and encouraged to mobilize as much as pain allowed under monitoring.   Conclusion: The patient's post-orthopedic surgery immobilization  combined with his pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors  significantly increased his risk of developing DVT. The management of DVT requires prompt diagnosis and effective anticoagulant therapy. This case highlights the importance of vigilant monitoring for thrombotic complications in immobilized patients  especially those with additional risk factors.
8,7,80,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial80,Patient Information  Mr. J  a 68-year-old retired male builder  native to Minnesota  USA  currently residing in a suburban area with his wife. He is a non-smoker and a casual drinker.  Presenting Complaint  He attended the ER complaining of acute  progressive left leg pain and swelling over the previous two days  mainly in his calf area. Furthermore  he stated that he felt a light ‘cramp-like’ discomfort while walking.   Medication History  He is on medication for hypertension with 10 mg lisinopril once a day and type 2 diabetes mellitus with 500 mg metformin twice a day. He also mentioned an occasional use of over-the-counter ibuprofen for decision-dependent arthritic pain.   Social History  He leads a rather sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity and follows an average diet. He reported no recent air travel  prolonged immobilisation or illnesses. He had a history of a fracture in his left tibia two decades back which was managed by a cast.  Physical Examination  Physical findings were largely unremarkable except for a notable difference in the size of the calves: the left being considerably larger than the right. The left calf appeared erythematous and somewhat warm to touch. The popliteal pulse was present but weak compared to the right side. Neurological examination showed nothing extraordinary.  Investigative Findings  Upon suspicion of deep vein thrombosis  a Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities was ordered  which confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the left popliteal vein with restricted blood flow. Lab tests reported an elevated D-dimer level at 900 ng/mL (normal range: less than 500 ng/mL). He had no sufficient signs of progressive renal impairment to contra-indicate CT pulmonary angiography  which showed no evidence of pulmonary emboli.  Management and Outcome  Initial phase was managed by Anticoagulant therapy (Apixaban 10 mg twice daily for seven days  followed by 5 mg twice daily). During the hospital stay  his symptoms gradually improved  and repeat Doppler ultrasound after a week showed a marked reduction in thrombus size. The patient was discharged after 10 days with an advised daily dose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice a day for six months and a recommendation to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  Conclusion  This case underscores the importance of considering deep vein thrombosis in patients presenting with unspecific leg pain  irrespective of the absence of traditional risk factors. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can effectively manage the disease and prevent complications  such as pulmonary emboli. It re-emphasizes the value of comprehensive history taking and physical examination when dealing with such non-specific presentations.

8,7,88,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial88,Case Report: A Case of Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 57-Year-Old Female  Patient Information:  The patient is a 57-year old Caucasian female presenting with persistent calf pain in her left lower limb for over a week. She has a known history of type II diabetes and hypertension for which she has been taking medication including gliclazide and amlodipine  respectively. She is a non-smoker and is reported to be moderate alcohol consumer. Her body mass index (BMI) measures at 29kg/m^2 signifying overweight status  and her family history is significant for venous thromboembolism  with her mother having suffered recurrent deep vein thrombosis. The patient has no known drug allergies.  Clinical Findings:  On examination  the patient's left leg appeared swollen and was tender to touch  predominantly in the calf muscle. Physical examination also revealed a slightly elevated temperature of 37.8°C  while blood pressure and heart rate readings were consistent with her hypertensive history. Through the use of Wells Criteria for DVT  she scored 3 which marks her as high probability.    Diagnostic Assessment:  A D-dimer test ordered was found to be highly positive  a key marker suggestive of a hypercoagulable state. Doppler ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis demonstrating an incompressible segment in the left popliteal vein. No superficial venous thrombosis was recorded.   Therapeutic Intervention:  The patient was immediately anticoagulated under the guidance of the local thrombosed protocol using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at a therapeutic dose as initial treatment. Whilst in hospital  she was educated on the importance of leg elevation and wearing compression stockings to improve pain and swelling. The patient was transitioned onto oral anticoagulant  rivaroxaban. She was recommended to follow up with a hematologist for further evaluation of the hypercoagulable state identified and the potential need for long-term anticoagulation. The patient was also referred to a dietician considering her overweight status.   Follow-Up and Outcomes:  She attended a 4-week post-discharge appointment where she reported a significant reduction in pain and improvement in her movements. Her repeat doppler ultrasound also showed significant resolution of the clot. She continues to be under the care of the hematologist and is tolerating rivaroxaban well. Being content with her weight loss following dietary intervention  she is more enthusiastic about managing her health conditions.  This case underscores the importance of considering venous thromboembolism even in subtle clinical presentations  particularly in patients with prominent risk factors  such as family history of DVT  obesity  and current treatment with medications which could pose a risk for DVT. Early detection and appropriate anticoagulant treatment remain key in managing this condition.

She is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic with no history of illicit drug usage. Her body mass index (BMI) is 25.4  indicating she falls within the overweight range.  Clinical Findings: The patient reported increasing pain and difficulty in walking due to the swelling in her lower leg. The limb had become noticeably redder and warmer to touch. She denied any associated chest pain  shortness of breath  dizziness  or fevers.   History: She had undergone a total hip replacement surgery six weeks prior due to severe osteoarthritis  following which she had been primarily bedridden  with limited movement. Her family history is significant for ischemic heart disease and hypertension  but no genetic or acquired thrombophilic conditions were reported.  Physical Examination: On inspection  the left leg was visibly swollen and hyperemic compared to the right. Palpation revealed that the swelling was warm and tender to touch. There were no visible varicose veins. The patient's vital signs were stable  with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg  heart rate of 88 beats per minute  respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute  and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.  Diagnosis: The clinical presentation and patient's history of prolonged immobilization raised suspicion for deep vein thrombosis. It was confirmed through a Doppler ultrasound that demonstrated a deep vein thrombosis in the left popliteal vein.   Therapeutic Intervention & Follow-up: The patient was immediately started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as a bridge to oral anticoagulant therapy  which was initiated the following day. Physiotherapy was also initiated to improve mobility. The patient was educated on the importance of mobility and using compression stockings to prevent recurrence.   On follow up after four weeks  the patient reported a marked improvement in the symptoms  and repeat Doppler ultrasound demonstrated a reduction in the size of the clot. She is due for another follow-up appointment in two months.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in patients with prolonged immobility  such as post-operative patients  to prevent potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism. Furthermore  it illustrates the crucial role of early recognition  appropriate treatment  and patient education in managing DVT.
8,7,90,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial90,Patient Information: Ms. AB  a Caucasian female  aged 64  presented to the clinic. She is retired and lives independently. No history of tobacco use or alcohol abuse. Medical history revealed that she had been diagnosed with hypertension two years ago and is on treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. She also had a subsequent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus a year ago  controlled with Metformin.  Presenting Symptoms: The patient reported progressive  painful swelling in her left lower limb for the past week. She had not experienced any recent trauma or injury. She also reported warmth over the swollen area  redness  and mild fever but no shortness of breath or chest pain.  Physical Examination and Investigations: The examination revealed a pitting edema on her left leg with skin discoloration. The left calf was tender. No superficial varicosities were seen. Homans sign was positive in the left leg. There is no superficial vein dilation or streaking. Laboratory investigations showed an elevated D-dimer test. A doppler ultrasound confirmed a non-compressible left common femoral vein suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Treatment: She was immediately started on anticoagulants  low-molecular-weight-Heparin (LMWH) and advised to elevate the limb and apply warm compresses. After five days of Heparin therapy  she was placed on an oral anticoagulant  Warfarin  with the plan to maintain INR between 2 and 3. The patient was counseled on the importance of medication compliance  regular follow-up visits  and lifestyle adjustment.  Discussion: The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes might have escalated the likelihood of DVT as vascular disorders were more prevalent amongst these patients. Further evaluations are necessary to ascertain if there is any underlying malignancy as there was no clear predisposing risk factor for DVT in her case such as recent surgery  long travel  genetic disorder  etc. A subsequent review of the medication regimen for her hypertension and diabetes will also be required.  In this case  prompt diagnosis assisted by D-dimer and Doppler studies  followed by early anticoagulation therapy  was essential to prevent possible complications such as pulmonary embolism. This case stresses the importance of recognizing the classical symptoms of DVT  early diagnostic investigations  and appropriate management.

Hematologic investigations were largely normal apart from slight elevation in D-Dimer levels.   VII. Therapeutic Intervention  Given the patient’s medical history and current condition  anticoagulant therapy was initiated using low molecular weight heparin  transitioning to oral Warfarin therapy with close INR monitoring for maintaining between 2 and 3. The patient was also advised to wear compression stockings and elevate his leg when sitting and sleeping.  VIII. Follow-Up and Outcomes  During a follow-up visit after two weeks  the patient's symptoms had significantly reduced. He reported a reduction in swelling  pain  and discomfort. INR was in range and medication regimen with Warfarin was continued.   IX. Patient Perspective  The patient was relieved that non-invasive therapy effectively managed the condition. He was glad that the early presentation prevented any possible complications like a pulmonary embolism.  X. Conclusion and Learning Points  This case highlights the importance of rapid diagnosis and management of DVT to prevent serious complications. Even in the outpatient setting  DVT should be promptly suspected when a patient presents with typical signs and symptoms  especially in high risk groups such as the elderly and those with a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension.   Informed consent: Informed consent for this case report was obtained from the patient.
8,7,92,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial92,Case Report  Patient Profile  A 67-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency room with a two-day history of pain and discomfort in his left calf. The patient also reported mild swelling  redness  and warmth over the affected area. No history of recent travel  surgery  trauma  or prolonged immobility was noted. He has a 30-year history of smoking one pack per day but quit six years ago. His other past medical history includes hypertension controlled in the medication lisinopril and hyperlipidemia treated with atorvastatin. The patient denied having any known allergies. He follows a sedentary lifestyle and works as an accountant.  Clinical Examination  On physical examination  the left calf was mildly swollen with erythema  warmth  and the patient reported pain on passive dorsiflexion of the foot. No inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted. The patient was afebrile with normal heart rate  blood pressure  and respiratory rate. Pedal pulses were palpable bilaterally. No other abnormal signs were found during the rest of the systemic examination.  Investigations  Laboratory investigations were ordered  and results were as follows: Complete blood count  renal function test  liver function tests were within normal limits. Coagulation profile revealed a marginally elevated D-dimer value at 0.6 mg/L FEU (reference: <0.5mg/L FEU).  An ultrasound Doppler study was requested and revealed an intraluminal filling defect in the left posterior tibial vein  confirmative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). No evidence of pulmonary embolism was demonstrated on a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram.  Diagnosis  Based on the clinical presentation  physical examination  and investigations  the patient was diagnosed with left lower limb deep vein thrombosis.  Treatment and Follow-up  The patient was admitted  and anticoagulant therapy was initiated with low-molecular-weight heparin (Enoxaparin)  later switched to oral anticoagulant (Rivaroxaban) as per protocol. He was advised leg elevation and graduated compression stockings. Education about the importance of mobility was provided to patient and caregivers.  The patient responded positively to the treatment with the resolution of the signs and symptoms within a week. He was discharged with instructions to continue Rivaroxaban and follow-up with the Hematology clinic. Any signs of side effects  such as bleeding or bruising  were to be reported promptly.   In conclusion  this case report of a 67-year-old male with deep vein thrombosis demonstrated the importance of considering DVT in patients presenting with unilateral leg swelling  even without recognizable risk factors. Early recognition and prompt initiation of anticoagulative management proved successful in the treatment of this case.
8,7,93,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial93,Patient Information  Initials: J.W Gender: Male Age: 65-years-old Marital status: Married Occupation: Retired  previously worked as a truck driver Race/ethnicity: Caucasian Insurance status: Medicare Location: Urban   Presenting Problem  The patient complained of persistent and painful swelling in the right lower limb for the past 1 week. He noticed the swelling started and progressively got worse after a long-duration flight. The pain increased when he tried to move his leg  or when touching the swollen area. He also mentioned a slight fever and malaise.  Past Medical History  J.W has been hypertensive for the past 15 years and takes a medication regimen of amlodipine 10mg daily. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 10 years ago  managed with metformin. He also has a history of a myocardial infarction 5 years ago  after which he quit smoking. He admitted drinking alcohol for recreation but denied any excessive consumption. There is a considerable lack of exercise in his routine. There is no known history of malignancy  trauma  hematologic disorders  or prior thromboembolic disease.  Physical Examination  The patient was alert and oriented. Vital signs were within normal limits except for slightly elevated blood pressure. Cardiac and respiratory examination was unremarkable. The right lower extremity was erythematous  edematous  and visibly larger than the left. There was tenderness along the course of the right posterior tibial and peroneal veins. No visible varicose veins were present.  Diagnostic Assessment  Upon clinical examination  there was a high index of suspicion for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A D-dimer test was done  which returned positive. Further confirmation was made with a venous Doppler ultrasound of the right lower extremity that confirmed a thrombus in the right popliteal vein. Full blood count  liver function  renal function  and glucose tests were within normal range.  Treatment Plan  Initial management included subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin and oral anticoagulation (warfarin). He was advised bed rest with leg elevation and compression stockings. The patient was hospitalized and monitored until international normalized ratio (INR) was therapeutic.  Long-term management includes continuing Warfarin for a minimum of 3 months  frequent monitoring of INR  and lifestyle modifications which included quit drinking  a balanced diet  regular exercise and avoiding long-duration travels without movement.  Instructed to return for any signs of excess bleeding  chest pain or difficulty breathing which could indicate possible complications such as bleeding due to anticoagulation treatment or pulmonary embolism.  Learning Points   This case exemplifies the necessity of keeping a high index of suspicion for deep vein thrombosis in patients presenting with unilateral lower limb swelling  especially with seemingly trivial precipitating factors like long-duration flights (Economy Class Syndrome). Timely management is essential to prevent complications such as pulmonary embolism  post-thrombotic syndrome  or recurrence of DVT. The role of lifestyle modifications in managing and preventing DVT should not be overlooked. 
8,7,94,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial94,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-aged Male  Patient Profile: Demographic Information: Mr. A  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  presented to the emergency department on July 9  2022. The patient is an accountant  married with two children  and resides in Philadelphia. His reported weight and height are 85kg and 180cm respectively. Mr. A is a moderate smoker with a 15-pack year history and consumes alcohol in moderation. He does not have any recreational drug usage history. He has no known food or drug allergies.  Medical History: Mr. A has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia that has been managed with lifestyle modification and medication (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin) for the past ten years. He has no history of surgery or hospitalizations and no known family history of blood clotting disorders.  Presenting Complaint: The patient presented with three-day history of progressive swelling  pain  and warmth in the right lower extremity. He also complained of mild shortness of breath  especially on mild exertion. Mr. A denied any history of recent surgery  significant travel  or prolonged periods of immobilization.  Physical Examination: On examination  his vital signs were stable with blood pressure reading 135/80 mm of Hg  pulse rate 84 beats per minute  temperature of 98.3 degree Fahrenheit  and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The right lower leg appeared markedly swollen and was warm compared to the contralateral leg. There was tenderness along the medial aspect of the leg and a positive Homans' sign. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Laboratory Investigations and Diagnosis:  Venous duplex ultrasonography was performed  revealing a non-compressible segment in the right popliteal vein - a clear indication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). D-Dimer levels were also elevated at 1 200 ng/mL (normal range: 0-500ng/mL). Blood tests also showed a slightly raised white blood cell count.   Treatment and Outcome: Mr. A was promptly initiated on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) along with oral anticoagulant  Warfarin. Graduated compression stockings were also advised to help reduce the swelling and pain. After 5 days of hospital stay with close monitoring  the symptoms substantially reduced  allowing for his discharge with advice to continue Warfarin for 3 months  regular follow-ups  and lifestyle modification education to quit smoking.  This case emphasizes the importance of considering DVT in patients presenting with unexplained unilateral leg swelling and pain  especially those with risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Moreover  it reiterates the need for patient education on lifestyle modification as a part of management in such cases.
8,7,95,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial95,Title: Recurrent Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Middle-Aged Female: A Case Report   Abstract:  This case report discusses a 47-year-old Caucasian female who presented with recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) despite suitable anticoagulation therapy.   Case Presentation:  The patient is a 47-year-old Caucasian female  non-smoker  with a history of hypertension and obesity. She first presented a year ago with symptoms of DVT in her left lower extremity after a long car ride and was subsequently diagnosed with her first DVT episode. She was started on appropriate anticoagulation therapy and maintained good outpatient follow-up.  However  the patient presented again twelve months later to our emergency department with a two-day history of acute swelling and pain in her left leg  fearfully suggesting it might be another bout of DVT. She denied any recent travel  surgery  immobilization  or change in her medication routine. She also denied any previous exposure to oral contraceptive pills or hormone replacement therapies.   Examination revealed an obese female in distress with an edematous left lower extremity. Her vital signs were stable. The swelling extended from her thigh to her calf  and it was tender to palpation. There was no discrete lump or evidence of superficial thrombophlebitis. No varicose veins were noted.  Investigations: Her lab values including complete blood count  coagulation profile  renal and liver function tests were all within normal limits. A D-dimer test was markedly elevated. An ultrasound Doppler confirmed the presence of an acute DVT in the left popliteal vein.  Treatment: She was hospitalized and started on therapeutic low molecular weight heparin. Prior to discharge  warfarin was initiated  and she was maintained on it until her INR reached the therapeutic range.  Discussion: This case is unique because despite compliant use of anticoagulation therapy  the patient experienced a recurrence of DVT. Secondary prevention strategies were revisited with the patient including regular mobilization  hydration  weight loss  and compliance with medications.  Conclusion: Recurrent DVT poses a real challenge in clinical practice. This case highlights the need for personalized anticoagulant treatment and constant patient education to prevent recurrent thrombotic events. Encouraging weight loss and diet control in obese patients is also crucial. Further genetic testing can be considered to rule out inherited thrombophilias  especially in patients experiencing recurrent DVTs.   Awareness of this clinical scenario can help identify potential cases of recurrent DVT and lead to more effective management strategies. 
8,7,96,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial96,Title: A Case of Idiopathic Deep Vein Thrombosis in a 55-year-old Caucasian Male  Abstract: This report describes a case of an idiopathic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in a previously healthy 55-year-old Caucasian man. The case highlights the patient's clinical manifestations  investigations  treatment  and long-term management.  Case report:  The patient  a 55-year-old Caucasian male  attended our clinic with a one-week history of pain and swelling in his left lower limb. He denied any history of trauma  recent immobilization  travel  or surgical procedures. He is a non-smoker and occasionally consumes alcohol. There was no family history of blood clots  heart diseases  or other hereditary conditions. The patient works as an office clerk and lives a sedentary lifestyle.  On examination  his vital signs were stable. The left lower limb was swollen in comparison to the right one  warm to touch  and somewhat erythematous. The patient's Physical examination noted Homan's sign as positive. The rest of the clinical examination was unremarkable. His complete blood count  renal function test  liver function test  and coagulation profile were normal.  A Doppler ultrasound of his left lower extremity revealed an acute deep venous thrombosis in the left popliteal vein extending into the left trifurcation veins. No detectable flow or compressibility was noted in these veins.  The lack of identifiable risk factors in the patient provoked a workup for thrombophilia abnormalities. Extensive laboratory investigations  including protein C and S  antithrombin III  and Factor V Leiden screen  in addition to homocysteine levels and a test for antiphospholipid syndrome  produced normal results. A chest x-ray  electrocardiogram  and echocardiogram revealed no abnormalities to suggest pulmonary embolism.  The diagnosis of idiopathic or unprovoked DVT was confirmed  and the patient was initiated on therapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin (Enoxaparin)  overlapped and followed by Warfarin. His clinical condition improved significantly over a week. The patient was counseled and educated about the importance of regular monitoring of INR values  lifestyle modifications  and adherence to medication.  Conclusion:  This case underlines the importance of considering the diagnosis of idiopathic DVT even in seemingly low-risk patients who present with compatible symptoms. A holistic approach is crucial in the management and long-term treatment of DVT  as is educating the patient about monitoring  medication adherence  and lifestyle modifications.

8,7,99,diagnosis8-prompt7-trial99,Case Report - Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Information:  A male Caucasian patient  aged 55  presented himself at the emergency department. He is a known case of diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the last 20 years. He's a former chronic smoker and stopped smoking five years ago. He used to work as a truck driver  which required long sedentary hours. He is a resident of Houston  Texas  living alone with limited mobility  and has no known allergies.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient came in with complaints of progressively increasing pain  swelling  and redness in his left leg. Simultaneously  he also complained of mild shortness of breath  slight chest pain  and occasional light-headedness. He denied any symptoms of cough  hemoptysis  or recent trauma to the legs.  Clinical Findings:  The left leg was visibly swollen  warm  and erythematous. The calf diameter was noticeably larger than the right side. Pedal pulses were palpable bilaterally with no visible varicosities. There was tenderness and prominent veins noted on his left leg along the venous distribution  suggesting phlebitis. Vitals on arrival were: BP 140/85mmHg  HR 105/min  RR 20/min  SpO2 96% on room air.  Diagnostic Focus and Assessment:  A Doppler ultrasound of both lower extremities was performed  which showed evidence of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left popliteal vein. A D-dimer test also came back raised  further supporting the diagnosis of DVT. Considering his symptoms of chest pain and light-headedness  an ECG and troponin levels were checked which came back normal  ruling out any immediate cardiac cause. However  a CT pulmonary angiogram was done based on clinical suspicion  which revealed a small pulmonary embolism in the right lower lung lobe.  Therapeutic Focus and Management:  The patient was immediately started on intravenous heparin following DVT confirmation. The bridging therapy was started with oral anticoagulants (warfarin) alongside IV heparin. Once the INR came in therapeutic range  IV heparin was discontinued and the patient was continued on warfarin. He was also provided with a graduated compression stocking.  Education about lifestyle modification emphasis on active mobilization  the importance of regular medication  routine follow-ups  and signs of complications or recurrence - were explained to him before discharge.  The patient’s progress will be monitored and will be followed up in two weeks  with specific attention to his warfarin dosage and INR check in a week. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion and timely intervention in the management of deep vein thrombosis to prevent complications.

8,9,1,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial1,Patient Identification: A 66-year-old female  Patient Demographics: Caucasian  retired school teacher  married with 2 adult children  Past Medical History: Non-smoker  drinks socially  has a history of hypertension being managed with medications such as Olmesartan  does not have diabetes  no known allergies.  Presenting Complaint: The patient reported to the emergency department with complaints of progressive left leg swelling and diffuse pain localized to her calf region. She mentioned she noticed these symptoms for the past 3 days  which had gradually increased. She has no similar complaint on her right leg. No other symptoms were reported.  Family History: Her father died from complications following a stroke at 72. Her mother is still alive at 88 with chronic arthritis. She has one brother with no significant health issues. No family history of clotting disorders.  Clinical Findings: On examination  her left leg was swollen compared to her right leg  with mild erythema. There was tenderness on deep palpation of the calf muscles. Her ankle and knee joints showed normal range of motion without pain. There was no evidence of peripheral arterial disease with intact peripheral pulses. Her vital signs were stable.  Diagnostic Evaluations: An emergency Doppler ultrasound of her left lower limb veins was conducted which confirmed a thrombus in her left popliteal vein  corroborating the suspicion of DVT.  Management: The patient was promptly started on low molecular-weight heparin - Enoxaparin (1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours) for immediate anticoagulation. Consultation with a hematologist was made for further management.  Prevention measures such as wearing compression stockings and elevation of the affected leg were also initiated. Education about the importance of mobility and hydration was provided.   In making a long-term plan  the patient's risk factors for DVT such as sedentary lifestyle and hypertension would needed to be addressed. Due to the family history of stroke  the possibility of an inherited coagulation disorder is also to be considered and genetic testing might be suggested. Her treatment responsiveness and side-effects would be observed carefully  with regular follow-ups planned.
8,9,2,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial2,Patient Presentation: Mr. E.  a 68-year-old Caucasian male  presented with unilateral swelling with pain and warmth of his right lower extremity that had been progressing for 4 days prior to his admission. His chief complaint was difficulty walking due to the swelling and the pain in his affected leg.   Past Medical History: Mr. E. has a significant past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  each managed appropriately on medication for the past 10 years with Lisinopril and Simvastatin respectively. The patient is a former smoker  quit 15 years ago  and is a non-alcoholic.  Family History: The patient has a family history of cardiovascular diseases; both his father and older brother had myocardial infarctions in their mid-60s.   Social History: The patient is a retired engineer living independently with his wife in their own home. He reports a sedentary lifestyle  mainly watching TV and yard work.  Physical Examination: The affected extremity was visibly swollen and erythematous with palpable localized warmth and tenderness to touch. Distal pulses present and equal bilaterally.  Lab Studies: Laboratory studies revealed a positive D-dimer  elevated blood pressure  slightly elevated cholesterol levels  and normal coagulation profile.  Imaging: A duplex ultrasound was performed showing a clot in the superficial femoral and popliteal veins consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Management: The patient was commenced on therapeutic dosing of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). After a few days  he was transitioned to long-term oral anticoagulation with Rivaroxaban.  Outcomes: In response to anticoagulation therapy  the patient showed significant improvement in his symptoms over the next week. He was counselled on maintaining a healthier lifestyle and encouraged to be more active  considering his sedentary habits. Additionally  given his family history and personal medical history  a need for continued careful monitoring was stressed.  Plan for follow-up: The patient will follow up in the outpatient clinic every 2 months to monitor for recurrence of DVT  treatment side effects  and adjustment of medication if required. He has been directed to reach out immediately if symptoms recur or worsen. A referral to a vascular surgeon was also made for consideration of post-thrombotic syndrome management and prophylaxis.  .    Discussion: This case underscores the importance of considering DVT in patients presenting with unilateral leg swelling and pain  especially in patients with a sedentary lifestyle and a history of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the lack of a direct familial history of venous thromboembolism  this patient's personal and familial history of cardiovascular disease do indicate a potential predisposition. A targeted history  physical  and diagnostic imaging are critical to the early detection and management of this potentially dangerous condition. 
8,9,3,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial3,Patient Presentation:   Subject: A 65-year-old Caucasian female.  Chief Complaint: Patient presents with progressive right lower extremity discomfort and swelling.   Medical History: Diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus five years ago  which she manages using diet  exercise  and medication (Metformin and Amlodipine). She quit smoking 10 years ago after a 40 years smoking history and also has a history of obesity but underwent successful bariatric surgery 2 years ago. She has no known drug allergies.  Family History: Both parents had cardiovascular disease. Her father had an MI at age 67  and her mother had a cerebral thrombosis at age 62. She has one sister diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis three years back.   Present Illness: Since two weeks  she has been experiencing a dull ache in her right calf area which is more noticeable at night and after prolonged sitting. She also noticed some swelling  warmth and skin discolouration in the same area. Symptoms intensified  prompting her to seek medical help.   Social and Personal History: She is a retired professor  widowed  and lives alone but within close proximity to her son. She has a history of prolonged immobility due to her previous job nature  which involved prolonged sitting hours.  Physical Examination: The patient seemed anxious. Vital signs were within normal limits. The physical examination revealed a swollen and indurated calf on the right  which is tender  warm  and with some erythema compared to the left calf. No visible varicose veins observed.  Given her symptoms of unilateral leg swelling  discomfort and the risk factors including age  obesity  family history  and sedentary lifestyle  the suspicion of deep vein thrombosis was raised.  Investigations: To confirm the diagnosis  a duplex ultrasound was conducted. Laboratory tests  including a complete blood count  PT/INR  aPTT  and D-dimer testing  were ordered.  Diagnosis: The findings from the ultrasound and high D-dimer levels confirmed the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Management: Patient was initiated on anticoagulation therapy starting with LMWH transitioning to oral anticoagulants. She was advised to wear compression stockings to aid blood flow and educated on the importance of nature walks to regain venous return. Instructions to recognize signs of pulmonary embolism were emphasized. She will have follow-ups to monitor her response to therapy and reassess in 3 months.  In summary  given the patient's symptoms  family history and personal risk factors  it was crucial to diagnose her with DVT swiftly and manage the same promptly to prevent complications.
8,9,4,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial4,Patient Presentation  Name: Mr. Rodriguez Age: 53 Gender: Male Ethnicity: Hispanic Occupation: Store Manager  Medical History:  Mr. Rodriguez has been previously diagnosed with Type II Diabetes and Hypertension for which he takes Metformin and Amlodipine respectively. He is a former smoker and quit 10 years ago after a 20-year habit. His other medical history includes obesity with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31.   Presenting Problem: Mr. Rodriguez presented to the clinic with swelling and pain in his left lower leg  just below the knee that has progressively worsened over the past four days. He denied history of injury or trauma and also reported a feeling of warmth at the swelling site. He rated the pain as a 7 on a scale of 1-10 which escalates to a 9 during walking.  Family History: The patient's father died at the age of 59 due to a stroke. His mother is alive and suffering from Hypertension and Type II Diabetes. His 56-year-old brother recently had a heart attack.  Diagnosis: The clinical symptoms along with positive D-Dimer test led us to perform a Duplex Ultrasound of the left leg. The ultrasound confirmed the presence of an obstructive clot in the femoral vein  indicating Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  Treatment: Mr. Rodriguez was admitted immediately and started on anticoagulant therapy. He was given intravenous administration of Heparin  followed by oral administration of Warfarin. Throughout his treatment  his International Normalized Ratio (INR) was checked regularly to monitor the effectiveness of the anticoagulant therapy.  Instructions were disclosed to Mr. Rodriguez emphasizing the importance of taking his medication regularly  avoiding long periods of sitting  maintaining a moderate level of physical activity  losing weight  and following a balanced diet.   Summary: In that context  DVT in Mr. Rodriguez is presumably related to his medical history of Type II Diabetes  Hypertension  obesity  family history of cardiovascular diseases  and sedentary lifestyle due to his occupation. Treatment is fully initiated and education has been provided to mitigate the risk of serious bleeding complications and potential pulmonary embolism. Regular follow-ups and strict monitoring of vitals and medication compliance are crucial to his condition.
8,9,5,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial5,Patient Presentation:  Demographics: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian  retired police officer. He's a heavy smoker with significant tobacco history. He lives in Albany  New York  with his wife.   Presenting Problem: He presented to the emergency department with a complaint of progressive and painful swelling in his right lower leg for the last two days. He has also reported mild breathlessness and episodic coughing over the last few days.  Past Medical History: He has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He had undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 9 years ago. His medications include losartan  metformin  and simvastatin.  Family History: His mother had an ischemic stroke in her late 60s and his father died of myocardial infarction at 75. His older sister was recently diagnosed with pulmonary embolism.  Observation and Tests: His vitals are stable with a slightly elevated BP of 150/90 mmHg and increased heart rate at 97 BPM. Physical examination revealed a warm  erythematous  and swollen right calf which was tender to palpation. He's afebrile. His Wells Score for deep vein thrombosis is calculated and is suggestive of a high probability. Further  a Doppler ultrasonography was performed which confirmed the presence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right lower limb. The D-dimer test was positive. Chest X-Ray was clear but given his shortness of breath and family history of PE  a CT Pulmonary Angiography was ordered which ruled out pulmonary embolism.   Treatment: The patient was immediately started on a therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH  Enoxaparin) and later shifted to oral anticoagulant  Rivaroxaban in view of long term treatment.   Healthcare Plan: The patient will be counseled regarding lifestyle modifications — cessation of smoking  maintaining a balanced diet  muscle-strengthening exercises  and regular follow-ups. He will be educated about the signs of complications like pulmonary embolism and the importance of adhering to anticoagulant therapy. Compression stockings will be advised to relieve symptoms and prevent post-thrombotic syndrome. Close monitoring of renal function and signs of bleeding will be required due to the anticoagulant therapy.   Given the family history of thromboembolic diseases  a consultation with a hematologist for possible inherited thrombophilia was also recommended. Familiar genetic mutations  like Factor V Leiden or Prothrombin Gene mutation  can be quite common in cases with a family history of venous thromboembolism.
8,9,6,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial6,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: Ms. Johnson is a 55-year-old Caucasian woman with a body mass index (BMI) of 33 kg/m²  indicating obesity. She is a former smoker and has been unemployed for the past 8 months. She has a family history of her father dying from a major stroke  and her mother is currently living with hypertension and diabetes.  Past Medical History: Ms. Johnson was previously diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. All of these conditions have been managed poorly due to issues with medication adherence and regular follow-up appointments. She also had a cholecystectomy performed five years ago.  Current Complaint: She was brought into the emergency department by her daughter due to a sudden  painful swelling in her right leg. The swelling was accompanied by redness  warmth  and a mild fever. She reported no recent injuries but mentioned an extended period of inactivity due to being bedridden with the flu for a week.  Clinical Examination: On examination  the right lower leg appeared swollen and erythematous. The Homans sign was present  which is indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). No signs of peripheral arterial disease were found  and the rest of the physical examination was largely unremarkable.  Investigations: Doppler ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a blood clot in the deep veins of her right lower limb. Her D-dimer levels were elevated  consistent with a DVT. Furthermore  her fasting blood glucose levels and blood pressure were also raised  reflecting poor control of her chronic conditions.   Management: She was immediately started on anticoagulant therapy with heparin and oral warfarin for the DVT. Adjustments were made to her existing medication regimen for her poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension. Efforts were also made to counsel her on the importance of medication adherence and lifestyle modifications like weight reduction  regular exercise  and a balanced diet.  Discussion: This patient's DVT can be attributed to Virchow's triad of hypercoagulability  stasis  and endothelial damage. Her obesity  sedentary lifestyle due to unemployment  recent inactivity (bedridden with the flu)  and poor control of her diabetes and hypertension put her at a higher risk of DVT development. Moreover  her family history puts additional genetic predisposition for thrombotic events. Thus  it is crucial to manage her DVT promptly and efficiently to prevent potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary embolism.   Moving forward  regular follow-up and control of her chronic conditions  maintenance of anticoagulant therapy  lifestyle changes  and ensuring medication adherence will be crucial to prevent recurrent thrombotic incidents. Educating her about the symptoms of DVT is important so that any recurrence can be detected and treated early.
8,9,7,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial7,Patient Information: Mr. John Smith  a 60-year-old African American male.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Smith came to the clinic with a complaint of swelling and tenderness in his left calf area  which he first noticed 4 days ago. The pain seems to worsen when he stands or walks. He also mentioned feeling mild warmth in the same area.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has hypertension  diabetes mellitus  and hyperlipidemia. He is a two-time pulmonary embolism survivor and had undergone hip replacement surgery eight months ago.  Family History: Patients mother had a history of DVT  and father died of a stroke. His elder sister also has hypertension.  Social History: Mr. Smith lives with his wife. He was a smoker but quit 10 years ago. Drinks alcohol occasionally. He used to be a truck driver and is now retired.  Medications: Currently prescribed metformin for diabetes  Losartan for hypertension  and Lipitor for hyperlipidemia.  Examination: On examination  his vital signs were within the normal range. His left calf appeared swollen and appeared slightly red as compared to the right calf.   Investigations: Blood tests show an elevated D dimer level. Doppler ultrasound confirmed the presence of a deep vein thrombus in the left popliteal vein.  Diagnosis: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the diagnosis based on clinical findings and investigations.   Plan: Start immediate anticoagulation therapy with heparin and then continue with oral anticoagulants such as Warfarin. Compression stockings have been prescribed to relieve swelling and pain. Lifestyle recommendations include avoiding prolonged periods of immobility and regular physical activity to encourage blood circulation.   Follow-up: Regular monitoring is needed every 3-6 months  or as clinically indicated  to assess the effectiveness of anticoagulation therapy and to look for any signs of a recurrent DVT.    Discussion: DVT is a serious condition due to its association with potentially life-threatening complications like pulmonary embolism. Mr. Smith's case is particularly challenging because he has multiple risk factors for DVT: prior history of DVT  post-surgical period  age and comorbid conditions like diabetes and hyperlipidemia. In such cases  post-surgery prophylaxis for DVT should be considered and proper follow-up to check for any signs of DVT.
8,9,8,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial8,Patient Profile:  Mr. Robert Johnson is a 66-year-old Caucasian male admitted to the hospital with complaints of unexplained extensive swelling  persistent pain  and warmth over the skin in his right lower leg.

He enjoys social drinking on weekends and has a balanced diet. Obesity is not an issue for him.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Johnson has a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension  for which he is on medication. He also underwent a total hip replacement surgery on his right side three years ago  following which he was on prophylactic anticoagulant therapy. There is no relevant history of hematological disorders or malignancy.  Family History:  Mr. Johnson's mother had DVT at the age of 74 and his only sister suffers from varicose veins. His father passed away at the age of 62 due to an apparent myocardial infarction. There is no family history of hypercoagulable states or cancer.  Presentation:  The patient presents with a swollen  painful  and erythematous right lower extremity. Physical examination reveals a positive Homan's sign (pain on forced dorsiflexion of the foot). There are no ulcers or trophic changes in the skin suggesting chronic venous insufficiency. Peripheral pulses are intact and the neurological examination is unremarkable. No palpable cords suggestive of superficial thrombophlebitis.  Investigations:  Preliminary laboratory tests including complete blood count  renal function  and coagulation profile are largely normal  except for slightly elevated D-Dimer levels. Doppler Ultrasonography confirms the presence of non-compressible segment in the right popliteal vein suggesting the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis.   A chest X-ray was done  which appeared normal excluding any signs of a recent or previous lung embolism. Given the family history  and after obtaining informed consent  a thrombophilia screening was also performed but deemed negative.  Plan:  Mr. Johnson should be immediately started on therapeutic anticoagulation with parenteral agents like LMWH followed by oral Warfarin therapy. Lifelong anticoagulation may be required considering his risk factors and familial predisposition to venous thromboembolism. Patient education  smoking cessation  and appropriate follow-ups must be ensured. The importance of regular monitoring of INR whilst on Warfarin therapy was reiterated to the patient.
8,9,9,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial9,Patient Presentation:  The patient  Mr. John Smith  is a 68-year-old African American male who was admitted to the hospital complaining of pain in his right calf and difficulties walking  which started around a week ago. He has a previous medical history of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension  both of which are well-managed with medication.  He is a retired engineer  married with two adult children  and is a former smoker  having quit approximately five years ago. However  he still consumes alcohol moderately. He is obese with a BMI of 30.5  and his dietary habits are rich in high glucose and high sodium foods. He admits to being sedentary  with very minimal physical activity.  The family history reveals that both his father and grandfather had heart diseases  which presented in their mid-50s and that his mother had Type 2 diabetes.  On examination  his blood pressure was 145/90mmHg and heart rate was regular at 72 beats per minute. His respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute and his temperature was 98.6°F. An assessment of the right calf showed it to be swollen  red  and warm to touch.  Imaging investigations (ultrasound) were performed which confirmed the presence of a blood clot in his deep veins  leading to the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Blood work showed elevated D-dimer levels  which was also suggestive of DVT.  Given the patient's age  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  and family history of heart disease  along with his current symptoms and test results  his doctor has suggested that this is a likely case of DVT.  The plan going forward includes immediate anticoagulant therapy  a change in diet and physical activity  and careful monitoring. A referral to a vascular specialist for further evaluation and possible intervention is also planned. A health talk on the importance of medication adherence  regular exercise  diet modification such as low sugar and salt intake  weight loss  cessation of alcohol intake  and regular clinic visits for monitoring will be delivered to the patient. The need for the usage of compression stockings will also be discussed.  The case emphasizes the importance of lifestyle modification in the management of DVT  especially in patients with a history of hypertension and diabetes. It also highlights the importance of early diagnosis and management. This is a prime opportunity for the patient to address his various health issues and to improve his overall quality of life.
8,9,10,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial10, Patient's Case Presentation:  Patient Demographics: A Caucasian male  aged 65  retired. He lives with his wife in the rural area  smokes occasionally  and has no known drug allergies. His educational background reveals he was a high school teacher.   Past Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension  which is under control with medication (Lisinopril/Hydrochlorothiazide). He had a cholecystectomy 10 years ago but has been otherwise generally healthy until now. He is slightly overweight (BMI 29)  and his diet often contains high-fat  high-calorie meals.  Presenting Complaints:  The patient presented to the outpatient clinic with a swollen  red and painful left lower limb for the past week  with no recent injury or trauma. There were no associated symptoms of chest pain  shortness of breath  or coughing up blood.   Family History: The patient's family history is significant for cardiovascular disease. His father had died from a stroke at the age of 70  and his mother had a myocardial infarction in her late 60s. He has two siblings  one of whom has been recently diagnosed with hypertension.  Examination: Physical examination revealed an erythematous and warm left calf  which was significantly swollen compared to the right. He was ambulatory but with some discomfort. His blood pressure and other vital signs were in the normal range.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Due to the suspicion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  a blood test (D-dimer) was ordered  which came back with elevated levels. A Doppler ultrasound confirmed the presence of lower limb DVT in the left superficial femoral vein.   Treatment and Follow-up: The patient was initiated on anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight-heparin followed by Warfarin to prevent clot development and propagation. Lifestyle advice was also given regarding diet modification  quitting smoking  regular exercise  and keeping well-hydrated. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess his response to therapy.  Discussion: In this patient  multiple factors have contributed to his DVT: his age  family history of venous thrombotic events  his hypertension (though it was well-managed)  and his dietary habits. As DVT can lead to serious complications including pulmonary embolism  prompt diagnosis - via D-dimer test and Doppler ultrasound in this case - and management with anticoagulants are crucial. Future care will need to focus on primary prevention and management of risk factors. Regular follow-ups will also be important to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment and make necessary adjustments.

8,9,17,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial17,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe  a 56-year-old African American male  presented to the clinic with complaints of increasing pain and swelling in his left lower leg over the past three days. Mr. Doe works as a long-haul truck driver and spends most of each day seated. He has a past medical history notable for obesity  Type-2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and a transient ischemic attack (TIA) two years ago. He is a former smoker (30-pack years) and quit 10 years ago  drinks alcohol socially and doesn't engage in regular physical activity.  Family history revealed that Mr. Doe's father died at age 62 from a stroke and his mother  aged 74  is alive with a diagnosis of COPD and breast cancer. He also has a sister  aged 58  diagnosed with venous thrombosis post her knee replacement surgery two years ago.  On examination  his left lower leg appeared erythematous  warm  and edematous. His body mass index (BMI) was 32 kg/m2  indicating obesity. Blood pressure was 146/92mmHg  pulse rate 88 bpm and regular  respiratory rate 16 bpm and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were palpable and equal bilaterally. However  Homan's sign was positive on left side indicating potential DVT. There were no ulcers or skin changes indicating chronic venous insufficiency.  Differential diagnosis includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  cellulitis  and ruptured Baker's cyst. Given his prolonged seating due to his profession  obesity  hypertension  diabetes  and family history  deep vein thrombosis remains the most likely diagnosis.   D-Dimer levels were ordered that came out to be high and an ultrasound Doppler study of the lower extremity confirmed the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. The ultrasound revealed a non-compressible segment in the left popliteal vein consistent with a thrombus.  The patient was immediately prescribed anticoagulants (low molecular weight heparin) along with strict advice for weight loss  increased physical activity  and regular monitoring of blood glucose and blood pressure. He was also advised to wear compression stockings to avoid post-thrombotic syndrome and to ease his current symptoms. He is to follow up in 5-7 days for reevaluation  at which point possible transition to oral anticoagulants can be made.  Given this patient's risk factors and history  collaboration with a cardiologist for risk stratification is suggested  and the patient should be counseled on symptom recognition  preventative measures for recurrent DVT and lifestyle modifications.   This case emphasises the importance of prompt evaluation of DVT symptoms and the need for preventative measures for at-risk patients. An interdisciplinary approach collaborating with cardiology and diabetic services would contribute to a comprehensive evaluation and management of Mr. Doe's complex medical needs.

Family History:  He reported that his mother had suffered from a stroke in her late 60s and his father died at age 62 due to a heart attack. He has two siblings – an older brother with a history of coronary artery disease and a younger sister who is a breast cancer survivor.  Exam and Work-Up:  On clinical examination  Mr. R had a positive Homan's sign. His vitals showed a slightly elevated blood pressure (145/90 mm Hg) and a regular pulse. Lab investigations revealed an elevated D-dimer at 1 800 ng/ml (normal range: up to 500 ng/ml). His hemoglobin was 13.2 gm/dl  white blood cell count was within normal range and his platelet count was elevated at 450 000/mm³. Fasting blood glucose was high  around 175 mg/dl (normal range: 70-100 mg/dl).  Diagnosis:  Given the patient’s symptoms  physical examination  positive Homan's sign and markedly elevated D-dimer levels  the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) was suspected. Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities confirmed a large occlusive thrombus in the left popliteal vein  confirming the diagnosis of DVT.  Management and Recommendations:  Mr. R was started on subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) and also an oral anticoagulant (Warfarin). He was hospitalized for observation. The patient received health education about the importance of quitting smoking  reduction of alcohol intake  regular exercise and adherence to diabetes  hypertension and hyperlipidemia medications. He was also advised to elevate the affected leg and apply warm compresses to reduce the pain and inflammation.   Mr. R was scheduled for a follow-up appointment after his discharge to reassess his condition and manage his chronic illness better. He was referred to a dietitian for better control of his diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.   This case highlights the importance of recognizing typical symptoms and signs of a potentially life-threatening condition such as DVT and the appropriate use of diagnostic modalities to confirm the diagnosis. The case also emphasises the necessity of lifestyle modification and management of underlying conditions as an integral part of the treatment.

The patient described the discomfort as gradually worsening from a mild ache to a throbbing pain. She has also reported being easily fatigued recently and cannot walk for long without needing to rest.  Past Medical History:  Mrs. Doe is newly diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her left leg. She is a type 2 diabetic managed with metformin for the past 10 years and has been treated for hypertension with lisinopril for the last 5 years. She had a hysterectomy 15 years ago due to fibroids but has no other surgical history. She has a history of occasional alcohol use but quit smoking 20 years ago after a 15-year habit.  Present Medical History:  Upon examination  the left leg was noticeably swollen with tenderness along the inner thigh. The leg was warm to touch  and redness was visible from the knee to mid-calf  which could indicate a superficial vein complication due to underlying DVT. Her blood pressure was slightly elevated at 145/92 mmHg from her regular range of 130/80 mmHg  likely due to pain. She had an appreciable pulse in her foot  which suggested no immediate threat of vascular compromise.  Family History:  Her father died from a heart attack at the age of 70 and her mother  who is alive  has hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She has two siblings – a brother with high cholesterol and a sister with no known health issues.   Investigation & Diagnosis:  She underwent a Doppler ultrasound confirming the presence of a thrombus in her left femoral vein confirming the diagnosis of DVT. Her D-dimer levels were also significantly elevated. Upon discussing her recent activities  she disclosed a long-haul flight about 7 days ago  which may have contributed to her developing DVT.  Treatment:  She was immediately started on anticoagulant therapy (low molecular weight heparin) and later bridged to warfarin  with the plan to continue warfarin for the next 3-6 months. She is scheduled for follow-ups to gauge her response to treatment  potential complications  and the need for continued anticoagulation therapy.  Conclusion:  Considering Mrs. Doe's newly diagnosed DVT  her antihyperglycemic and antihypertensive treatment regimens should also be reassessed during follow-ups to ensure optimal disease management. Patient education concerning signs of complications like pulmonary embolism will also be crucial.

There is no known diabetes  vascular disease  or heart disease. Mr. Doe has yet to undergo a colonoscopy  despite reaching the recommended age of diagnostic testing.  Family History  There is a prominent family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  with his mother having an episode of DVT at the age of 65 and his paternal grandfather having a pulmonary embolism in his 70s. Additionally  his father has had a heart attack at the age of 67. His younger sister is diabetic and hypertensive.   Previous Consultancies  Four days prior to hospital admission  Mr. Doe visited his GP for his leg pain but was provided with analgesics and was advised to rest  keep the leg elevated  and apply hot and cold compresses interchangeably.  Current Complaint  The patient later noticed that his left leg was warm and swollen  with the skin taking on a reddish-blue color. Pain has intensified and Mr. Doe reported that it worsened when he stands or walks. He has not experienced chest pain  cough  or shortness of breath.  Clinical Findings  Upon physical examination  his left lower limb was indeed warmer  swollen  and erythematous when compared to the right. His vital signs were within the normal range. He had a high D-dimer level and an Ultrasonographic Doppler revealed a non-compressible left popliteal vein suggestive of deep vein thrombosis.  Treatment Plan   Given his clinical presentation and family history  further investigations to rule out any clotting disorder were necessary. He was started on Low-Molecular-Weight-Heparin (LMWH) and Warfarin therapy was initiated. Mr. Doe was educated on the importance of adhering to his medications  risk factors of DVT  the necessity for regular INR check-up  and leg exercises to prevent DVT in the future. He was discharged with plans for a follow-up in the outpatient department.   It is also recommended that Mr. Doe needs to quit smoking  lose weight  and prevent long periods of immobilization  in order to reduce his risk for another deep vein thrombosis incident. An avenue for discussion is Mr. Doe's overdue colonoscopy  to ensure he doesn't have any other hidden health concerns.   
8,9,23,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial23,Patient Information:  Mr. John Smith is a 65-year-old African American male who presented at the emergency department with complaints of progressively increasing swelling  pain  and warmth in his left lower extremity for the past one week. His pain is 7/10  exacerbated by movement  and partially relieved by rest and over-the-counter pain relievers. He denies any history of trauma to the affected limb  but admits to recent long-distance flight two weeks ago. He has no history of similar events in the past.   Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus  both controlled with medications. He quit smoking 10 years ago and drinks alcohol occasionally.   Family History:  The patient has a positive family history for cardiovascular disease. His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 72  and his older brother had a stroke at 68. All lean towards a strong genetic predisposition to thrombotic events.   Diagnostics:  Upon physical examination  his left leg was found to be swollen  tender and warmer than the right leg  with a positive Homan's sign. Blood pressure was found to be 145/90 mmHg and other vitals were within normal limits. Doppler ultrasound showed thrombosis in the lower segment of the left popliteal vein consistent with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). D-Dimer levels were found to be considerably elevated.   Treatment:  He was admitted and given subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) considering his renal function. Compression stockings were recommended for symptomatic relief  and ambulation was encouraged whenever feasible to prevent extension of thrombus and post-thrombotic syndrome.   In conclusion  Mr. Smith  with his medical history of hypertension and diabetes and positive family history for cardiovascular disease  falls in a high risk category for DVT development. His recent long-distance flight is a significant risk factor leading to prolonged immobility which likely triggered the clot formation.   Future Management:  Further management will include initiation of oral anticoagulant after 5-7 days of bridging with enoxaparin and his response to treatment will be closely monitored. He will be educated on compliance with his anticoagulant therapy and signs of potential complications related to DVT like pulmonary embolism. Lifestyle modification and proper management of hypertension and diabetes were also advised.  This case emphasizes the need for considering DVT in patients presenting with unilateral leg swelling  especially if risk factors like recent travel  personal history of thrombotic events  family history of cardiovascular events or certain underlying medical conditions exist.

8,9,27,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial27,Patient Presentation  Patient: Mr. Johnson  a 67-year-old Caucasian male   Presenting Complaint: Complains of unexplained swelling and pain in his left leg for the past two weeks  Past Medical History:   Mr. Johnson has a documented history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for which he is on bronchodilators. He had a myocardial infarction five years ago and consequently underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He has been taking aspirin and statins since. Mr. Johnson is also a former smoker  with a history of 40 pack-years.  Family History:   His father died from coronary artery disease at the age of 72  and his mother died from stroke at 76. His older brother has been recently diagnosed with type II diabetes.  Presenting Symptoms:  On examination  the left calf was noticeably swollen compared with the right  with increased warmth and tenderness on palpation. He also indicated a moderate degree of discomfort upon dorsiflexion of the foot (positive Homan’s sign). No superficial veins are visible.  Investigation:  Mr. Johnson underwent a Doppler ultrasound which confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the left deep femoral vein  therefore diagnosing him with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Plan:   Management commenced immediately with the administration of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for rapid anticoagulation. Plans to switch to oral anticoagulants  like warfarin  for long term site specific home therapy were initiated along with discussions on likely complications  like pulmonary embolism. Lifestyle modifications were suggested with an emphasis on regular leg exercises  wearing compression stockings  and elevating the leg while sitting or resting.   Notes:  Due to Mr. Johnson's age and history of cardiac conditions  he falls into a higher-risk category for DVT. His previous immobilization due to the myocardial infarction  and the presence of COPD  could have predisposed him to his current thrombus formation. His family history suggests a genetic predisposition to vascular and possibly thrombotic conditions. Careful planning of his management is required considering his chronic COPD  and previous history of myocardial infarction. The aim is to prevent the expansion or migration of the clot which might lead to life-threatening complications like a pulmonary embolism. Regular follow-up with echo-Doppler is considered to monitor the resolution of DVT.

8,9,31,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial31,Patient Presentation   Mr. Davis  a 57-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to our outpatient department with complaints of persisting pain and swelling in the right calf that had worsened over the past few days. The pain was described as a deep ache  exacerbated during walking  with the calf warm to the touch and appearing distinctly edematous.  The patient’s past medical history revealed a condition of type II diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years  well-controlled with Metformin. He was also diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago  managed by Lisinopril. He suffered a myocardial infarction 2 years ago  and has been on a regimen of daily low-dose Aspirin since.   He has had a history of smoking a pack a day for about 25 years but quit after his myocardial infarction. He drinks socially and has no known alcohol addiction. His activity level has been below average post his heart condition and spends a majority of his day seated because of his desk job. There is no known history of any bleeding disorders  trauma  recent surgery or prolonged immobilization in his case.  His family history revealed that his father had a stroke at the age of 70 and his mother suffered from rheumatoid arthritis. His older brother was recently diagnosed with Pulmonary Embolism.   The patient’s BMI was recorded at 30  confirming obesity. His vitals upon examination were normal except for a slightly elevated blood pressure (145/95 mmHg). Given his signs and symptoms coupled with his obesity  lifestyle  and family history  a diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) seemed likely.  Lab findings showed an increased D-dimer level of 500 ng/mL (normal range: less than 250 ng/mL). A Doppler ultrasound further revealed a thrombus in the femoral vein  confirming the DVT diagnosis.   An interdisciplinary team involving a cardiologist  radiologist  and primary physician is formed to discuss the best approach concerning his management. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated promptly with heparin  transitioning to warfarin  with a target INR range of 2-3. The patient has been advised to maintain an active lifestyle with controlled diet and regular follow-ups for monitoring of warfarin therapy. The need for psychological therapy has also been discussed with the patient to help him cope with the lifestyle modifications.

8,9,33,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial33,Patient Information: Ms. Jane Doe  a 45-year-old African American female  Presenting Concern: The patient came to the hospital with complaints of growing pain and swelling in the right lower extremity for the past couple of days. She also mentions a generalized feeling of discomfort and fatigue.  Past Medical History: She is moderately obese (BMI 30 kg/m2)  non-smoker  and has a history of Protective Service work that requires prolonged periods of inactivity or sitting. She has no history of major illness. However  she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 5 years ago and is regularly using levothyroxine.   Family history: The patient reports that her father had a stroke at the age of 65. Her mother is currently healthy at age 74 but her maternal grandfather had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   Physical examination: A thorough physical examination of the patient revealed a warm  swollen right calf  which was tender to touch. The circumference of the right calf was found to be 3 cm greater than the left calf (measured 10 cm below the tibial tuberosity). No chest symptoms  palpitation  or shortness of breath were reported.  Laboratory Evaluation: Lab evaluations show increases in D-dimer levels. Her thyroid function tests are within normal limits. Other routine blood tests  including complete blood count  liver function test  and kidney function test  were within normal ranges.  Diagnosis: Based on the Wells criteria for DVT and clinical findings  the probability of DVT was high. An ultrasound was recommended  which confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the popliteal vein  leading to a diagnosis of right lower extremity DVT.  Treatment Plan: The patient was put on an anticoagulant regimen  starting with low molecular weight heparin and transitioning to oral warfarin. She was educated about the need for regular follow-ups to monitor her INR and was advised on lifestyle modification such as weight loss and regular exercise. The importance of compression stockings to reduce swelling and relieve pain was emphasized.  Discussion: This case notes the prevalence of DVT among individuals with poor lifestyle habits such as prolonged periods of inactivity or sitting. This combined with a familial history of DVT raised Ms. Doe’s risk. As such  preventative measures should be taken for those with similar lifestyle habits or genetic pre-dispositions.  Plan for Follow-up: Follow-up after four weeks to monitor the alleviation of symptoms and then regular follow-ups to monitor her INR if the patient remains on warfarin longer term.
8,9,34,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial34,Patient Presentation: Ms. Fowler  a 67-year-old African-American female  presented to the emergency department complaining of increasing pain  tenderness  and swelling in her left lower extremity over the past three days. She describes the pain as a continuous dull ache  non-radiating  6/10 intensity  worsening with prolonged sitting and improves slightly with leg elevation. Ms. Fowler is a retired elementary school teacher  lives alone  nonsmoker  and has a history of moderate alcohol intake. She denies recent travels  surgeries  or changes in medication.  Past Medical History: She has a history of hypertension (well-controlled on amlodipine) and type 2 diabetes (controlled with metformin). She had a hysterectomy 20-years-ago for uterine fibroids without any perioperative complications. No history of thromboembolic events.  Family History: Her father had a stroke at the age of 75  and her mother died at the age of 79 from complications related to Alzheimer's disease. She had an older brother who suffered from coronary heart disease and had a myocardial infarction at 60. No known family history of clotting disorders.  Physical Examination: Patient is alert  oriented  in mild distress secondary to pain. Vital signs were stable. Lungs clear on auscultation. Cardiac auscultation normal with regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen soft  non-tender with normal bowel sounds. The left lower extremity showed redness  warmth  and swelling  primarily in the calf region  but no signs of any skin breakdown  ulceration or infection. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were 2+ and equal bilaterally. Neurological exam showed no abnormalities; intact sensation and motor strength were noted in both lower extremities.  Diagnostic Assessment: Given the presentation and exam findings  a clinical suspicion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was considered. Ms. Fowler was sent for a Doppler ultrasound of the left leg  which confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the femoral vein. Her D-dimer level was elevated  consistent with the diagnosis.  Treatment Outline: Ms. Fowler was advised to continue with her current medication for hypertension and diabetes. She was started on anticoagulation (low molecular weight heparin initially followed by oral rivaroxaban) for the DVT. She was educated about the symptoms of pulmonary embolism  a severe complication of DVT and was advised to return to the hospital if those symptoms occur.  Ms. Fowler is scheduled for a follow-up in the primary care clinic in a week's time to monitor her symptoms and plan long-term anticoagulation therapy. Discussions were also made to investigate for any possible underlying malignancies or clotting disorders due to the unprovoked nature of the event.

Examination and Investigations:  On examination  the left leg was swollen and erythematous  and the patient exhibited extreme discomfort upon physical assessment. Comparatively  the right leg appeared normal. The post-examination findings raised a strong suspicion of DVT. A Doppler ultrasonography was performed  which indeed confirmed the presence of DVT in the left lower limb.  Management:  Mr. Doe was immediately put on anticoagulants in the form of injections  and later  oral anticoagulants were added to his treatment regimen. Weight loss and daily exercises were strongly recommended to manage his obesity and improve his overall health. He was advised to avoid long periods of immobility and to take frequent breaks while working to ensure movement.  Follow-up and Patient Counseling:  A follow-up visit is scheduled for Mr. Doe in 2 weeks to assess his response to the therapy and any potential side effects from medications. Health education about the management of DVT and the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle to reduce risks has been emphasized.  Mr. Doe’s case highlights the importance of considering DVT in patients who present with unilateral leg swelling  particularly those with risk factors such as prolonged immobilization (long flight)  obesity  and a positive family history.

She is a retired school teacher  and her past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Mrs. A is on regular antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medications  as per her primary care physician's advice.  Presenting Issue: Mrs. A presented at the outpatient clinic with persistent pains and swelling in her left lower leg over the past four days  accompanied by warmth and redness. She initially dismissed the discomfort  associating them with her usual arthritis. However  with escalating symptoms  she decided to seek medical attention.  Family History: Her family history reveals that her father had a stroke at the age of 67  her mother has type II diabetes  and her older brother died of myocardial infarction at 60. Her only child  a daughter aged 35  is presently healthy.  Diagnostics and Tests: Complete Blood Count (CBC)  D-dimer test and a Compression Ultrasound of the left lower leg were conducted. CBC was within normal range. The D-Dimer test result was significantly elevated  indicating possible presence of an abnormal level of fibrin degradation fragments  typically seen in DVT or Pulmonary Embolism. The ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  revealing a non-compressible segment in the left posterior tibial vein.  Management: Mrs. A was immediately started on a course of anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (Enoxaparin)  followed by oral warfarin for long term management. She was also educated on lifestyle modifications such as regular walking  leg elevation and use of elastic compression stockings.  Follow-Up: She was advised to follow up in the clinic in one week for monitoring her response to the therapy  and to adjust the warfarin dose based on her International Normalized Ratio (INR) levels. In addition  she was informed about the symptoms of pulmonary embolism- a potential complication of DVT  and advised to immediately report any such signs.  Summary: Timely identification and management of DVT in this patient is essential given her previous history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and her family history of cardiovascular disease  making her more susceptible to severe complications. Regular follow-ups and monitoring are critical to ensure effective treatment. Integration of DVT prophylaxis strategies in patients similar to Mrs. A would be beneficial in preventing such incidences in the future.

He is a retired engineer  married for 40 years  with two children and five grandchildren.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. A.B presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset right leg pain and swelling that has persisted for the past two days. He noted that the discomfort increased with walking and standing. He also reported occasional shortness of breath.  Relevant Past Medical History: Mr. A.B has a history of hypertension controlled with medication (Amlovas 5mg daily)  and he underwent an appendectomy at 22. Over the last six months  he had noticed progressive breathlessness when climbing stairs. His BMI is 29 and he is an occasional smoker.  Family History: Mr. A.B's father had late-onset diabetes and died of a heart attack at 80. His mother passed away at 90 from complications of a cerebrovascular accident. His sister has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  posing a genetic predisposition to the condition in the family.  Clinical Investigations: A physical examination resulted in the discovery of elevated temperature (38.3C)  calf tenderness  and swelling in the right lower limb. A D-dimer test indicated higher than normal levels  suggesting potential clot presence. An ultrasound Doppler study was performed  confirming the presence of a thrombus in the right lower limb's deep veins. He was started on therapeutic  weight-based low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)  and oral anticoagulation therapy with a target INR of 2-3 commenced the following day after consultation with a hematologist.  Impression and Plan: Based on the clinical presentation  physical examination  his sister's medical history specifically  and the diagnostic tests  Mr. A.B. has been diagnosed with right lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was admitted for further observation and management. His treatment regimen includes anticoagulation therapy and compression stockings to alleviate symptoms and prevent clot propagation.  Education and lifestyle modifications  such as gradual increase physical activity  maintaining a healthy diet  weight loss  and smoking cessation  were advised for the long-term treatment. He will be scheduled for follow-up visits in the outpatient clinic once discharged. His family was also educated about the symptoms of DVT since the family history may increase their risk.   This case also suggests the possibility of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with the occasional shortness of breath  requiring further investigations in the form of a CT pulmonary angiogram.   Clearly  Mr. A.B's case should be treated with vigilant care given his age  underlying hypertension  and positive family history for DVT. Such cases highlight the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of DVT to avoid life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism.

As per John  he recently had a long haul flight of 16 hours from Australia to the US about 3 days ago. He recalls his right leg being immobile and constricted for most of the flight which could be a potential risk factor for his current state.  Past Medical History:  John has a history of hypertension for which he takes Lisinopril. His blood pressure is controlled adequately. He has no history of diabetes  cardiac ailments  or any cancer.  Social History:  John has a history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day for the last 30 years but quit 5 years ago. He drinks alcohol socially and does not use illegal drugs.  Family History:  No family history of clotting disorders  malignancy  or genetic disorders. His mother died in her 80s due to Alzheimer's and his father died of a heart attack in his late 70s.  Physical Examination:  John is in obvious pain during the examination. His vital signs are stable. His right leg is red and swollen in comparison to the left leg and is tender in the calf region. No ulcers or cyanosis were noted.  Investigations:  Blood tests  including complete blood count  coagulation profile  D-dimer level are recommended along with Doppler ultrasound of the leg.  Diagnosis:  John has been diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) on the basis of physical examination. This diagnosis needs to be confirmed or refuted by the laboratory and radiology investigations.  Management plan:  If DVT is confirmed  John is likely to begin anticoagulation therapy to prevent the clot from getting bigger and to stop it from breaking off and causing a Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Patient education about the importance of medication compliance and lifestyle modifications (proper hydration  regular exercise  avoiding long periods of immobility) forms an integral part of the management.  Follow-up:  Regular follow-ups to monitor anticoagulant therapy and relief from symptoms will be scheduled.  This brief case presentation highlights the potential risk factors  clinical presentation  and diagnosis and management of DVT in an elderly patient with a significant risk factor of immobilization during a long flight.
8,9,51,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial51,Patient Case Presentation: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information: Patient X is a 60-year-old Caucasian male weighing approximately 86 kg and standing 5 feet  10 inches tall.  Chief Complaint:  Patient X presented with minor pain and swelling in the left leg  specifically the calf region  that has gradually increased over 4 days.   History of Present Illness: Patient reported a lack of mobility due to a recent left hip replacement surgery one month ago  following a fall from a ladder while doing some home repairs. He notes feeling unwell and experiencing warmth in his left calf  describing the pain as a 'muscle pull.' He also reported mild shortness of breath when he walks a short distance.   Past Medical History:  Patient has a past medical history of hypertension  type 2 diabetes  hip osteoarthritis  and a myocardial infarction eight years ago. Medications include Metformin  Lisinopril  and daily aspirin. No known allergies to medications were reported. Patient is an ex-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally.  Family History:  Father had heart disease and died at age 78  while mother  now 82  is managing osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes. The patient has one older brother who is currently undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.   Physical Examination:  On physical examination  his vital signs were stable. Lower extremity exam showed swelling (2+ edema) in the left leg  calf tenderness  and warm skin. The right leg was normal. There was no chest pain  but the patient appeared mildly anxious. Cardiovascular and abdominal exams were normal.   Considerations and Impression: The patient's symptoms and recent history of hip surgery indicate a high likelihood of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). He is considered high risk  given his age  recent surgery  limited mobility  and history of cardiovascular disease.   Plan: A Doppler Ultrasound was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other causes of his symptoms. The patient has been started on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy (low molecular weight heparin) until further investigations. Patient has been instructed to elevate his leg and perform simple exercises. If DVT is confirmed  long-term anticoagulation therapy is warranted  given the size and location of the thrombus.

She works as an office assistant and leads a sedentary lifestyle  mostly sitting on her desk for prolonged periods. She is a smoker with a 20-pack year history. She denies illicit drug use and alcohol.   Medical History: She has a history of hypertension  diagnosed two years ago and is on Lisinopril 10 mg daily. She has no history of diabetes mellitus or hyperlipidemia. She is normotensive and her blood glucose levels are within normal range during recent medical interventions.  Presenting Complaints: She reported increased leg pain over a period of the last 5 days which has gradually worsened. The pain was associated with swelling and tenderness. There was no reported trauma.   Family History: Her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60 and the mother died of breast cancer at 75 years. She has a family history of thrombotic events  her younger brother suffering from a pulmonary embolism at the age of 46.  Diagnosis: On physical examination  there was left calf tenderness and swelling  positive Homan's sign. No skin discoloration or ulceration was observed. D-dimer was found to be elevated at 700 ng/ml. She was then referred for an ultrasound scan of her left lower leg  which confirmed the presence of a clot in the popliteal vein. The diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was established.  Management and Recommendations: She was started on anticoagulation with Heparin  followed by transition to oral anticoagulant  Warfarin  for a period of at least three months. She has been counseled about the signs and symptoms of Pulmonary Embolism. Risk factor modification was discussed  involving cessation of smoking and initiation of regular physical activity.   Follow Up: The patient is recommended to have periodic follow-ups for monitoring the INR (international normalized ratio) and for dose adjustment of Warfarin. She is also advised to seek immediate medical attention if she experiences symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath  that could indicate a possible Pulmonary Embolism. Screening for occult malignancy is also suggested given her age and unprovoked DVT.   This case highlights the importance of considering DVT in patients who present with unexplained pain and swelling in the lower limbs  particularly in those with risk factors such as sedentary lifestyle  smoking  and a family history of thrombotic events.
8,9,53,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial53,Presentation  Patient Profile: Ms. Robbins is a 72-year-old Caucasian female with a recent diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She resides in a nursing home and has a personal aide that assists with ambulation. She was admitted for right calf swelling and pain.   Past Medical History: Her past medical history is significant for hypertension  obesity  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for which she is on a regimen of amlodipine  metformin  and tiotropium respectively. There's no history of previous DVT or pulmonary embolism.    Family History: Her family history is notable for her father dying of a stroke at age 75. She has one brother currently managing diabetes and hypertension.   Presentation: Over the last week  Ms. Robbins complained of a progressive swelling and constant  non-radiating pain in her right calf. No history of trauma or prolonged immobilization exists. She has no past experiences of similar episodes  dyspnea  chest pain  or hemoptysis.  Examinations: Upon physical examination  the patient's vital signs were stable. Her right calf was tender  edematous  and warm compared with her left calf. There was no superficial venous distention or skin discoloration present. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.   Investigations: Deep vein thrombosis was suspected based on clinical presentation. A full blood count  coagulation profile  and D-dimer were ordered. Results showed D-dimer of 900 ng/mL (Normal <500 ng/mL). An ultrasound Doppler study of the right lower extremity subsequently confirmed the presence of DVT.  Management: After diagnosis  she was started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)  transitioning to oral anticoagulants for long-term therapy. The patient  family members  and the nursing home staff were educated about the usage of compression stockings and the importance of mobilization to minimize the risk of recurrence.  Conclusion: Although Ms. Robbins is at risk due to her age  obesity  and probable lack of mobility  she had no prior family history of DVT. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for DVT in high-risk patients with lower limb swelling and pain. Regular monitoring and management of the patient's comorbidities  along with proper care  would be necessary to avoid recurrent episodes or further complications.

8,9,62,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial62,Patient Presentation:  Mr. James Allen  a 60-year-old Caucasian male  presented with complaints of significant swelling  warmth  and tenderness over the right calf region  consistent with the signs and symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).   Past Medical History:  Mr. Allen is diagnosed with hypertension from the age of 50  and Type II Diabetes Mellitus for the last seven years. He has been on oral anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive medications  showing inconsistent control over his blood sugar and blood pressure levels. He had a minor MI (myocardial infarction) 5 years ago  which was managed with medication therapy  and is currently on low-dose Aspirin. Mr. Allen has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 35 years  although he has reduced it to half a pack in the last year.  Demographics:  Mr. Allen is a retired engineer  married with two children  living in the urban population of Texas. He leads a sedentary lifestyle  mostly staying at home  reading  or watching television. His diet is predominantly high in cholesterol and fats.  Family History:  He has a notable family history of cardiovascular diseases  with his father having died from a stroke at 65  his older brother experiencing a heart attack at the age of 58  and his mother diagnosed with hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus.   Presenting Complaints:  Mr. Allen has been experiencing a sudden onset of pain  swelling  and warmness in his right calf started a couple of days ago. There is no history of trauma  injury  or prolonged immobilization. There is no marked fever  no chest pain  or shortness of breath. He does express feeling a bit drained and fatigued though.  Relevant Laboratory Investigations:  A complete blood count  differential analysis  and coagulation profile were ordered. The results indicated a normal blood count with slightly elevated platelets  and prolonged PT and APTT. D-Dimer concentration was significantly raised indicating the possibility of any thrombus formation. His fasting glucose and HbA1C levels were high  confirming poor control over diabetes.  Imaging:  A Doppler ultrasound imaging was performed which confirms the presence of DVT in the right popliteal vein.  Coupled with the patient’s medical history  symptoms  and laboratory results  he was diagnosed with DVT likely caused by hypercoagulability state in the backdrop of uncontrolled diabetes  hypertension  and a sedentary lifestyle.  Mr. Allen was started immediately on anticoagulant therapy using low molecular weight heparin  and will likely be switched to oral anticoagulants like warfarin. He was also counseled on smoking cessation  lifestyle modifications  maintaining proper foot hygiene  and regular exercise. Regular monitoring of his blood sugar levels and hypertension has also been recommended.
8,9,63,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial63,Patient Presentation  Patient Information: A 72-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Walters  retired school teacher  non-smoker  residing in Seattle  Washington.  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Walters presented himself at the emergency department with complaints of pain and swelling in his right calf that had been persisting for five days. He also observed a mild discoloration and warmth over the same area.   Past Medical History: Mr. Walters has a history of hypertension  hyperlipidemia and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation approximately eight months ago  for which he was prescribed a daily dose of aspirin. He also reported a sedentary lifestyle post-retirement.  Medications: He is currently taking Lisinopril for hypertension  Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia  Metformin for diabetes  and Aspirin for atrial fibrillation. He confirmed that he was adhering to his medications regularly.  Family History: His father had suffered a stroke at the age of 70 and his mother struggled with coronary artery disease. Both his parents had hypertension. There is no known family history of blood clotting disorders.   Examination: On examination  the right calf was notably swollen and tender with a bluish hue. There was local warmth but no evident skin breaks or signs of infection. His vitals remained stable but his heart rhythm was irregular  in line with his history of atrial fibrillation.  Investigations: An urgent venous Doppler ultrasound confirmed the presence of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right lower limb. D-dimer levels were elevated  supporting the diagnosis. A blood panel indicated poor glycemic control and raised LDL-cholesterol despite treatment.  Diagnosis: Based on the history  clinical examination  and results of the diagnostic tests  a diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) was made.   Management: Mr. Walters was immediately started on low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) to prevent clot propagation and to protect against the risk of a pulmonary embolism. His aspirin was stopped due to the new anticoagulant. The current regime for his pre-existing comorbidities was reevaluated. Education around diabetes and cholesterol control was provided along with advice on the importance of mobilization and physical exercise.  Community/Discharge Plan: A referral was made to a community anticoagulant service for ongoing monitoring and transition to an oral anticoagulant. If his condition stabilizes  he will be considered for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Regular follow-ups with his primary care physician were scheduled with the focus on better control of diabetes  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  and atrial fibrillation.    Patient education was emphasized  including the need for weight loss  lifestyle modifications  ankle and calf exercises  staying hydrated  and recognizing symptoms of complications such as pulmonary embolism. Family members were also educated about his condition and its associated potential risks.   Risk Factor Reduction: Lifestyle changes were strongly suggested including daily walks  resisting the urge to cross his legs often  and limiting his intake of foods high in vitamin K.   On a final note  this case serves as a reminder of the increased risk of DVT in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities and underlines the importance of a comprehensive approach to managing these patients  incorporating both pharmacological treatments and lifestyle-modification strategies.

Past Medical History:  Mr. S has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes four years ago. His most recent blood pressure stood at 160/100 mmHg. He has previously been non-compliant with his medication  but has shown improvement in the last two years. His other significant past history includes a sedentary lifestyle with obesity (BMI: 32)  alcohol consumption with occasional tobacco use  and he acknowledges his diet is high in salt and processed foods.  Family History: His father died of a stroke at age 70  while his mother is alive and receives treatment for chronic heart disease. His older brother underwent a double bypass surgery at age 60.  Presenting Condition: On examination  Mr. S's left lower limb was noticeably swollen compared to his right  warmer  and a homogeneous red-blue discoloration was seen over his calf. He also showed positive results on Homan's Sign. After performing a D-dimer test  which was positive  an ultrasound confirmed a blood clot in the deep vein of his left calf  thereby diagnosing him with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  The working diagnosis identified some notable risk factors  such as his prolonged sitting during long driving hours  obesity  hypertension  diabetes  a family history of cardiovascular disease  and his age.  Plan: Mr. S was started on anticoagulant therapy with a recommendation to continue for at least three months. Measures to reduce his blood pressure including dietary and lifestyle changes were also advised. Patient education about the signs of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) was stressed  considering the potential for DVT to progress to PE. To address his diabetes  adjustments to his current medication regimen were considered. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor his DVT  along with his other chronic conditions.  In conclusion  Mr. S’s condition results from a combination of hereditary and lifestyle factors that need to be strictly managed for a successful treatment outcome and prevention of complications.

Family History There is a history of coronary artery disease in his family; his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 59  and his elder brother had a coronary angioplasty at the age of 62.  V. Social History He lives with his wife in a two-story house. He has a sedentary lifestyle  with little to no exercise. Does not intake alcohol or illicit drugs. He's been on a high-salt and high-fat diet for years.  VI. Medications He is on amlodipine and rosuvastatin.  VII. Clinical Examination & Investigations Upon examining  his left calf was swollen  tender  and warmer to touch than the other leg  with a circumference 3cm more than the right calf. His vital signs were stable but physical examination revealed a slightly raised jugular venous pressure. A Doppler ultrasound confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left popliteal vein extending into the calf veins.  VIII. Diagnosis Based on the patient's age  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  family history of cardiovascular disease  clinical symptoms  and Doppler ultrasound findings  he was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis.  IX. Treatment & Follow-Up Mr. Smith was immediately started on anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin and then planned for long-term warfarin therapy. Leg elevation and compression stockings were advised to reduce edema and pain. He was also advised to increase physical activity and was referred to a dietitian to help with weight reduction and dietary management. Transthoracic echocardiogram was also ordered to rule out any associated cardiac abnormalities like a clot in the heart or pulmonary embolism. He was given a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess the effect of therapy and adjust the warfarin dose if necessary.   This case highlights the importance of taking a complete medical  family  and social history. It reminds us to evaluate non-modifiable (age  family history) and modifiable risk factors (obesity  diet  sedentary lifestyle) to guide the treatment approach in patients.
8,9,68,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial68,Patient Information:   Mr. John Smith  a 65-year-old male accountant with a BMI of 30  has come to the hospital with swelling  pain  and redness in his right lower limb. He has a ten-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a recent history of prolonged bed rest following a knee replacement surgery conducted six weeks ago. His only medications are metformin and low-dose aspirin. His only noted allergy is penicillin.  Family History:  Mr. Smith's family history is significant for cardiovascular diseases. His father died at 70 from a myocardial infarction and his older brother  aged 68  currently living  has a history of stroke. His mother passed away from breast cancer at the age of 72. There are no known genetic disorders in the family.  Smoking and Alcohol:  Mr. Smith admits a smoking history of 25 years with a quadruple pack-year history but stopped about 15 years ago. He admitted that he consumes alcohol socially  no more than twice a month.  Presentation:  Upon initial assessment  Mr. Smith presented with unilateral swelling  warmth  and pain in the right calf region that was exacerbated by flexion of the foot. Preliminary examination showed a palpable cord along the line of the right popliteal and femoral veins. No systemic symptoms  such as fever or hemodynamic instability  were reported.   Investigations:  A Doppler ultrasound scan confirmed the presence of a thrombus in the deep veins of his right calf  consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). His D-dimer level was also high  further confirming the diagnosis.  Plan:  Mr. Smith was started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for immediate anticoagulation while the oral anticoagulant  warfarin  was introduced concurrently. His INR will be monitored to ensure apt anticoagulation. The plan will involve overlapping warfarin with LMWH for at least five days until his INR is therapeutic for two consecutive days.   The consideration for assessment of thrombophilias after completion of anticoagulation therapy was also made  as his prolonged immobilization and recent surgery  along with his age  may have contributed to his predisposition to DVT.  Risks and benefits  involving potential bleeding complications  of anticoagulation therapy were explained  with the patient displaying an understanding of the treatment. Follow-up appointments were scheduled to ensure therapeutic compliance  continuity of appropriate care  and reduce the chances of post-thrombotic syndrome.
8,9,69,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial69,Patient Presentation:  Patient Information: The patient is a 65-year-old male  Caucasian  who resides in an urban center in the United States. He is a retired military personnel living with his wife. He is non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol.  Chief Complaint: He visited the Outpatient Department with a chief complaint of progressive pain and swelling on his left lower leg for the past 3-4 days.  Past Medical History: Diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 10 years ago which are well-controlled on medication. He underwent a total knee replacement surgery on the right knee one year back. No history of DVT or PE.   Family Medical History: The patient’s father suffered from coronary artery disease and his mother had a history of stroke. There is no family history of blood clot disorders or malignancies.   Physical Examination: Upon physical examination  the left lower limb appeared swollen with warmth and redness compared to the right side. A positive Homan’s sign was reported.  Investigations: Lab examination revealed an elevated D-dimer level. The Doppler ultrasound and venograph of the left lower limb revealed a thrombus in the left posterior tibial vein  confirming the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis.  Medications: The patient is taking Lisinopril for hypertension and Rosuvastatin for hyperlipidemia.  Discussion: The patient's age and surgery history might have contributed to the development of DVT along with his non-mobile lifestyle post-retirement. Also  his hyperlipidemia increases his risk of atheroma development  which can further contribute to thrombosis.   Treatment: Anticoagulant therapy was initiated with Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) administered by subcutaneous injection. After a few days  he was transitioned into a long-term anticoagulant therapy  specifically the oral medication Warfarin. The introduction of a regular light exercise program was encouraged and the importance of taking his medication as prescribed was stressed.  Follow-up: Arrangements were made for regular INR monitoring and a follow-up appointment in the vascular surgery clinic was scheduled in two weeks to monitor his therapeutic response.  The patient was educated about the importance of maintaining a balanced diet avoiding vitamin K rich food  as this can affect the efficiency of warfarin. Also  the vital information regarding the early signs of pulmonary embolism and when to seek medical help was provided.   This case highlights the importance of identifying risk factors for DVT and keeping a high suspicion for early detection  leading to the prompt and appropriate management and potentially preventing serious complications.
8,9,70,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial70,Patient Profile:  Mr. A is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  recently retired from his job as an engineer  who lives in urban Texas with his wife. Mr. A was a smoker for 25 years  quit 15 years ago  and has a moderate history of alcohol consumption. He has been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes  both being managed for the past decade. The patient is overweight with a BMI of 33 and leads a largely sedentary life. His father died of a heart attack at 70  and his maternal aunt was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her 50s.    Current Health Concern:  Mr. A visited the clinic complaining of pain and swelling in the left lower leg  which he first noticed three days ago. The swelling has progressively worsened  and the skin appears warm and reddish. He also reports a mild fever but denies any history of recent trauma or injury to the area. His symptoms indicate the possibility of DVT.  Clinical Assessment:  Blood workup revealed elevated D-dimer levels. An ultrasound was performed for definitive diagnosis  which confirmed the presence of a clot in the deep vein of his left calf  confirming a diagnosis of DVT. Additional testing  such as ECG and chest x-ray  was performed to rule out the presence of pulmonary embolism.  Risk Factors:  Mr. A's sedentary lifestyle  obesity  and history of smoking are likely contributors to his DVT. His history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes are also related factors. His maternal family history of DVT and his age may further have increased his risk.  Management Plan:  Current appearances suggest an uncomplicated DVT. Mr. A is recommended to start on anticoagulation therapy to prevent the clot from growing. He is prescribed low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to be used initially  to be overlapped and followed by an oral anticoagulant. In addition  he is advised to elevate his limb  use compression stockings  and take analgesics for pain relief.  Discussion:  Given the patient's chronic conditions  it is imperative to ensure appropriate management of the hypertension and diabetes. Patient education on lifestyle modifications is crucial  including the importance of regular physical activity and a balanced diet to manage weight. Cessation of alcohol is recommended. Regular follow-ups will be necessary to monitor his condition and make adjustments to his treatment as needed.
8,9,71,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial71,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Thomas White  a 65-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history most noteworthy for obesity  hypertension  and hyperlipidemia. He is a retired software engineer and a nonsmoker. He is known to have a sedentary lifestyle and has a family history of venous thromboembolism (his father had a pulmonary embolism at the age of 57). He had a cholecystectomy 25 years ago and has been on antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medications for the past decade.  Recently  Mr. White presented to the clinic with complaints of growing pain  warmth  and swelling in his right lower leg  particularly in the calf region  which has persisted for the past 10 days. Following a positive Homan’s sign during the physical examination  further investigations were conducted.  Laboratory results revealed a rise in D-dimer levels. The Doppler ultrasound of the right lower extremity depicted the existence of a deep vein thrombosis in the distal femoral vein. His blood pressure was 145/95 mmHg; BMI around 30 kg/m2 and other vitals were stable.  Further history-taking revealed that Mr. White had undergone a total knee replacement surgery 2 weeks prior due to severe osteoarthritis. He had been non-compliant with post-operative mobilization instructions and prophylactic anticoagulant therapy  as he neglected the importance of them and stopped taking the medication out of fear of bleeding side effects.  He currently lives with his wife who is a retired nurse and has been supportive throughout his episodes of illness.   Keeping his age  lifestyle  hypertension  recent immobility from post-surgical recovery  and the family history of venous thromboembolism in view  Mr. White is at high risk for deep vein thrombosis. His treatment plan would involve reinstating anticoagulant therapy  structured physical activity  and follow-up scans with a possibility of thrombolysis if the DVT does not resolve or symptoms get worse.  In conclusion  Mr. White's situation emphasizes the importance of proper health education and the necessity of adherence to post-operative instructions. Trust-building and proper communication are crucial aspects to prevent such avoidable complications.

8,9,77,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial77,Patient Profile: Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 63 years old  Gender: Male Occupation: Retired Engineer  Marital Status: Married  Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Doe visited his local GP clinic reporting a progressive painful swelling in his left lower leg since last one week. He also mentioned noticing skin redness and warmth. Mr. Doe reports difficulty in walking due to the intense discomfort. On further questioning  he also noticed mild shortness of breath that started two days ago. He has not experienced any chest pain  hemoptysis or syncope.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe is known to have hypertension and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  for which he has been receiving treatment for last 8 years. His glucose levels and blood pressure are usually well-controlled with medication. He had a MI 5 years ago  for which he was hospitalised and managed medically. He's been a smoker for over 40 years but quit 5 years ago following his MI. He's also obese with a BMI of 31.  Family History: His father died at 66 due to heart disease  and his mother at 72 from lung cancer  she was a lifelong smoker. His older brother is alive and has hypertension. No notable genetic disorder or hereditary disease in the family.  Clinical Findings: On examination  his vitals were largely within normal limits with his BP at 132/86 mmHg and pulse 78 bpm. Abdomen was soft and non-tender  his cardiovascular examination was unremarkable with no abnormal heart sounds. However  his left lower leg was erythematous  swollen and warm to touch with positive Homan's sign. Respiratory examination revealed mild tachypnea without any adventitious sounds.   Diagnostic Assessment: Based on clinical findings of the patient a provisional diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was made. An urgent D-Dimer test was ordered  which came back elevated. Doppler ultrasound was subsequently performed confirming the presence of DVT in the left lower leg. An ECG was performed showing sinus rhythm  no acute ischemic changes. A chest CT was advised to rule out pulmonary embolism due to the suspicion raised by the shortness of breath and tachypnea.  Plan of Care: Anticoagulation was initiated promptly to prevent clot expansion and pulmonary embolism. Since this is John's first DVT  the decision was made to start on Apixaban  a direct oral anticoagulant  for a minimum duration of 3 months. Consultation with the vascular surgery team was made. Patient and family education about disease  compliance with treatment and follow up appointments was carried out. The need for lifestyle modifications involving dietary habits and regular exercise was also stressed upon to manage obesity  hypertension  and diabetes.   Conclusion: Mr. Doe’s case underscores the risk of DVT in patients with multiple risk factors like advanced age  history of smoking  hypertension  obesity and heart disease. It emphasizes the need for a high level of suspicion in at risk patients presenting with suggestive symptoms and the importance of swift management to prevent severe complications like pulmonary embolism.

The patient lives with his wife in a suburb and has excellent familial support.  Family Medical History:  His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 68. His mother lived to age 82 and had a history of hypertension. He has one brother who is 61 years old and diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.   Presenting Complaint: Mr. Brown presented with swelling  tenderness  and redness in his right lower leg. The pain in his leg started a couple of days ago without any apparent cause and progressively worsened. The patient also noticed that the skin on his leg was warmer than usual.  Examination: Upon examination  Mr. Brown's vital signs were stable  but his right lower leg was notably swollen  warm  and tender on palpation. The consultation included Duplex Ultrasound  which confirmed the diagnosis of DVT. There were no other significant examination findings.  Management Plan: He was hospitalized and started on a regimen of anticoagulants immediately  specifically a direct oral anticoagulant. His regular medications  including antihypertensives  statins  and antidiabetic medications  continued as per usual. Lifestyle changes such as regular leg exercises  elevation of the affected leg  drinking plenty of fluids  and weight management  were also emphasized to prevent recurrence.  Prognosis:  With early intervention and appropriate treatment  Mr. Brown's prognosis looks good. His symptoms have already started to improve  however  the risk of developing post-thrombotic syndrome  a long-term problem with pain and swelling in the leg  and the risk of another DVT will need to be monitored continually.   His lifestyle interventions will also need to be re-evaluated from time to time and optimally managed to keep contributing risk factors (e.g.  obesity  diet) at bay. Monthly follow-ups with vein scans are scheduled for the upcoming year to ensure the clot is resolving and to prevent the occurrence of possible complications. There is also a plan to involve a dietitian and a physiotherapist in Mr. Brown's management.    In conclusion  Mr. Brown's case is a classic example of how lifestyle diseases can pile up to increase the risk of other  potentially serious conditions such as DVT. It emphasizes the need for patient education and public awareness about preventive measures and early consultations in case of symptoms.

He further admits to some instances of mild shortness of breath but no chest pain or cough.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia  managed with lisinopril and high-dose atorvastatin respectively. No previous history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 15 years ago  and no surgical complications were reported.   Family History: Mr. Smith's father had coronary artery disease and passed at the age of 75. His mother died of an unknown cause at the age of 89. His older brother had a stroke at the age of 70  and a younger sister is healthy. No family history of coagulation disorders or unexpected clotting events.     Social History: Mr. Smith is a widower living independently. He is a former smoker  has quit 20 years ago. He admits to occasional alcohol use. He maintains a sedentary lifestyle  most of his activities are chair-bound owing to his hobbies  such as reading and chess playing.  Recent Events: Mr. Smith had a long-haul flight (12-hour trip) three weeks ago to visit his daughter in Spain. After returning  he started noticing the symptoms  initially faint but gradually worsening over time.  Physical Exam: On physical examination  the left lower extremity was warm and noticeably swollen than the right. No pitting edema or visible erythema was observed. Pulses were palpable and equal in both lower extremities.  Investigations and Diagnosis: Considering his recent air travel and clinical presentation  a clinical suspicion of deep vein thrombosis was made. A venous Doppler ultrasound confirmed the presence of a non-compressible left popliteal vein  confirming the diagnosis of DVT. Pulmonary embolism was ruled out using a D-dimer test and chest imaging due to his mild breathlessness.  Treatment and Follow-Up: Mr. Smith was started on low molecular weight heparin followed by a planned transition to warfarin. He was educated on the importance of mobilization and wearing compression stockings during long-haul flights. He will be closely monitored with regular blood checks to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation.  This case shows the importance of considering DVT in patients presenting with unilateral leg swelling  especially in the context of recent long-haul travel or prolonged immobilization. His hypertension and hyperlipidemia also pose a higher risk of vascular complications.

8,9,90,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial90,Patient Presentation  Profile:  The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired engineer  non-smoker  from a middle socio-economic background who presents with a 1-week history of a swollen  painful left lower leg. He denies any recent trauma or injury to the leg. He does have a known history of hypertension for the last ten years  which is managed effectively with medication (Lisinopril 10mg daily).  Past Medical History: Aside from hypertension  his past medical and surgical history is significant for a gastric ulcer and a cholecystectomy 15 years ago. The patient has had no previous incidents of thromboses or pulmonary embolism. No known allergies are reported. He is physically active  enjoys regular walks and does minor chores in his backyard. He consumes alcohol socially  averaging about 1-2 glasses of wine per week.  Family History: His father died at the age of 70 due to a myocardial infarction  and his mother suffered from type 2 diabetes and passed away at 78 years old. His only sibling  a sister  is alive and well with no significant medical conditions. As per the known family history  there's no record of venous thromboembolism or any known hereditary coagulopathy.  Recent History:  Three months ago  he had a short trip overseas involving 8 hours of flight. However  he reported no issues during that time. There has been no recent hospital admissions or surgeries. For the past few days  the patient has been complaining of gradual onset  worsening pain  redness  and swelling in his left calf. He hasn’t taken any medication for the same.  Physical Examination: On examination  the patient's left calf is indurated  erythematous  and mildly edematous. There's 2cm of more circumference on the left calf compared to the right  with a positive Homan's sign. His vital signs show no abnormality and the rest of the physical examination is normal.  Clinical Impression: A presumptive clinical diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis was made. The patient was referred for Doppler ultrasound examination of the lower limb veins  D-dimer assay  and other relevant blood investigation for confirmation. He's currently being managed on low molecular weight heparin pending the results.  Management: The patient's condition will be managed accordingly once the test results are reviewed. This may include anticoagulants  compression stockings  and lifestyle changes. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor his condition and review his medication plan.  Considerations: Given his age  recent long-distance travel  and presentation  the possibility of venous thrombosis was raised. The patient doesn't seem to have obvious risk factors like cancer  familial clotting disorder  or obesity; therefore  this might be an unprovoked episode of DVT. If confirmed  further search for undiagnosed malignancy will be contemplated as per guidelines. There's also a need to consider the possibility of post-thrombotic syndrome as he's presenting after a week. His hypertension also needs to be managed regularly as it may contribute to the progression and recurrence of DVT.
8,9,91,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial91,Patient Presentation:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. X  from Albany  New York  who presented to the emergency department with swelling and severe pain in the left lower leg. Mr. X is a former social worker  retired  married  and lives with his wife. He is a non-smoker but has a reported history of moderate alcohol use.   Past Medical History: Mr. X has a known history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Hypertension  and Hyperlipidemia. He is on Metformin  Lisinopril  and Atorvastatin. He underwent a total hip replacement two months ago  which was complicated by prolonged immobility.  Family History: The patient reports a paternal history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. His father  who passed away at age 70  had multiple episodes of DVT and PE which were attributed to genetic thrombophilia. His mother  deceased at age 80 suffered from arthritis. He has no siblings. His two children are alive and well.  Current Presentation: Mr. X complained of a progressively worsening painful swelling over his left leg for the past two days. He denied experiencing any chest pain  shortness of breath  cough  or fever. Upon examination  the left lower leg was visibly swollen and warm to touch  compared to the right leg. Pulses in the left leg were palpable  but the leg was tender  especially in the calf area.  Relevant Investigations: A Doppler ultrasound of the bilateral lower extremities was performed which showed an acute deep vein thrombosis in the left popliteal vein and the distal portion of the left superficial femoral vein. Other routine laboratory tests  including kidney function  were within normal limits. His coagulation profile showed increased D-dimer levels.  Impression and Plans: Given the clinical presentation  ultrasound findings  and history of recent immobility following hip surgery  a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis was made. Considering his history of DVT in his family  it suggests a likely inherited thrombophilia.  Management: The patient was immediately started on low molecular weight heparin for anticoagulation. His other medications were continued as before. He was also advised to ambulate with assistance to promote blood flow.  Considering that this could be a recurrent condition  genetic testing for inherited thrombophilia will be done. Long-term management will include anticoagulation therapy while balancing the risks of bleeding. His family members would also be advised to get tested for inherited thrombophilia  given the strong family history.  Outcome: The patient's symptoms were relieved after initiation of treatment  and he was discharged with a follow-up appointment in the hematology clinic to discuss the implications of his potential thrombophilia. His family members were also referred for testing  given the strong family history. His alcohol use would also be addressed  as it might have an effect on his overall health in the long term. 
8,9,92,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial92,Patient Presentation:  Mr. Gordon  a 70-year-old Caucasian male  was admitted to the ER complaining of pain and swelling in his left lower limb. As an ex-smoker and retired truck driver who often engaged in a sedentary lifestyle  he presented with a substantial risk for developing DVT. His height is 5’9” and weighs about 85 kgs.   Past medical history:  Mr. Gordon was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia ten years back  well managed with atenolol and simvastatin. He has a ten-year history of Type II diabetes mellitus which is currently managed with metformin. He had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago with successful angioplasty. He was also aware of mild prostatic hypertrophy but has not undergone any specific treatment.  Family History:  His mother and maternal aunt had suffered from a stroke in their later years  but there was no known history of blood clotting disorders or venous thromboembolism in the family.   Presenting complaint: He noticed pain and swelling in his left lower leg one week ago  which gradually worsened over time with increased tenderness  warmth  and discoloration around the calf area. There were no symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath. No recent travel history or signs of an apparent infection or injury.  Physical examination:  On physical examination  his vital stats include a blood pressure of 138/85 mm Hg  a pulse of 78 beats per minute  a temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit  and a respiratory rate of 16 beats per minute. Upon palpation  the left calf is noticeably swollen and appears redder than the right calf.   Diagnostic impressions:  With physical examination and patient history  a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was suspected. He was sent for a D-Dimer test and lower extremity venous duplex ultrasonography which confirmed the diagnosis of DVT.   Treatment plan:  The primary care includes anticoagulation  to prevent propagation of the clot. He was put on a regimen of Heparin and then switched to warfarin for long term management. As an adjunct to medication management  he is advised for incentive spirometry and venous foot pump for ensuring smooth blood flow. He was advised a healthier diet and light exercises were also suggested to shed some weight and to keep his other conditions in control.  Risk of DVT recurrence:  Given the patient’s conditions and lifestyle  he is at a considerable risk of DVT recurrence  hence necessary changes in lifestyle and strict compliance to management plans are recommended.
8,9,93,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial93,Patient Information:   The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian male  Mr. B  hailing from the suburban region of Colorado. He lives with his wife in a comfortable middle-class neighborhood. He is a retired software engineer and spends most of his time doing indoor activities like reading  computer programming  and watching television.   Presenting Issue:   Mr. B has been experiencing persistent pain  swelling  and warmth in his left lower leg since the past one-and-a-half weeks. Initially  he dismissed them as symptoms of aged-induced fatigue. However  when the pain started getting intense  he decided to seek help.   Medical History:   Mr. B has a history of type-2 diabetes and hypertension; both conditions are being managed with oral medication. He also had an open cholecystectomy about five years back due to gallstones. Apart from these  he is also known to have hypercholesterolemia and he's on statin therapy. Mr. B does not smoke or use alcohol.  Family History:   His father had coronary artery disease and suffered from a myocardial infarction in his early 60s  while his mother has osteoporosis. There is no family history of any coagulopathy or DVT.   Examination & Diagnosis:  On examination  the left calf was found to be noticeably swollen  with an increased temperature than the surrounding skin and a slightly erythematous overlying area. The Homans' sign was positive. Mr. B was subsequently diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his left leg after a Doppler ultrasound report confirmed the presence of a non-compressible segment in the left popliteal vein  suggestive of a thrombus.   Treatment & Recommendations:  Management is centered on an immediate start of anticoagulation therapy to prevent the clot from enlarging  leading to a pulmonary embolism. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) such as Enoxaparin is initiated  and after a few days overlap  Warfarin therapy is added.  Simultaneously  patient education has been provided on the importance of regular leg exercises  wearing compression stockings in the affected leg to reduce swelling  and maintaining a healthy lifestyle that includes having a balanced diet and a regular physical activity regimen.  Follow-Up:  A follow-up appointment has been scheduled next week to monitor Mr. B's progress and make any necessary therapeutic adjustments.  In conclusion  while Mr. B's Sedentary lifestyle and medical conditions increase his likelihood of developing DVT  with prompt diagnosis and effective treatment  he is expected to have a fairly good prognosis. However  he will need to make lifestyle changes to prevent a reoccurrence in the future.
8,9,94,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial94,Patient Identification: Mr. John Smith is a 65-year-old Caucasian male presented with a two-day history of increasing pain and swelling in the right lower extremity.   Presenting Symptoms: He stated that he noticed a dull pain in his right calf  followed by progressive swelling  redness  and warmth over that area. This was associated with mild shortness of breath. He denied chest pain  cough  and hemoptysis.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension and type II diabetes  both well-controlled with medication. He also had a cholecystectomy approximately 10 years ago. He had no prior history of thromboembolic disease.  Current Medications: Metformin  Lisinopril  and Metoprolol.  Family History: His mother had a stroke in her late 70s and his father died from a heart attack in his early 60s.  Lifestyle and Social History: He recently retired from an office job and has been leading a largely sedentary lifestyle. He is an ex-smoker and quit 20 years ago. He has a moderate intake of alcohol (1-2 glasses of wine in the evening). His diet is usually balanced but not specifically tailored to his diabetes. He lives with his wife  who is his primary caregiver.   Physical Examination: On examination  there was noticeable swelling of the right calf compared to the left  with warmth and redness over the calf muscle. The right calf was tender to touch. His vital signs remained stable. There were no signs suggestive of a pulmonary embolism.   Investigations: A duplex ultrasound of the right lower extremity showed a clot in the deep vein behind the knee  suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). His D-dimer levels were also significantly elevated. EKG and chest X-ray were performed to rule out any signs of pulmonary embolism  both of which were unremarkable.  Management: Mr. Smith was started on anticoagulation therapy as per the standard guidelines for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.  Summary: 65-year-old Mr. Smith with a history of hypertension  diabetes and sedentary lifestyle developed an acute onset of right lower limb deep vein thrombosis likely secondary to his prolonged periods of immobility after retirement. His shortness of breath and raised D-dimer level signify a threat of subsequent pulmonary embolism  for which he was started on anticoagulation therapy and monitored closely.  Further Plan: Apart from anticoagulation  Mr. Smith and his family members were educated about leg exercises  keeping hydrated  and the benefits of regular movement. He will also need strict sugar level monitoring to keep his diabetes under control. He and his wife were also educated about the symptoms of pulmonary embolism to seek immediate medical help if required.

8,9,100,diagnosis8-prompt9-trial100,Patient Presentation:  Mr. John Doe is a 75-years-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department with edema and discomfort in his left lower leg  which become worse over the last week. Mr. Doe reports that he's been living a sedentary lifestyle after he retired five years ago which has become progressively worse due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He has a 20-year history of hypertension controlled by lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. He is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history having quit 15 years ago and is an occasional alcohol consumer.  In addition to his leg symptoms  he reports recent unexplained weight loss  fatigue  and feelings of weakness. Prior to presenting to the emergency department  the patient reported initial mild swelling and a discomfort sensation in his left lower extremity. However  the symptoms persistently worsened leading to significant during movement  and he noticed increased swelling and warmth over the area.  His family history indicates that his father died of a stroke at 67  and his mother had a myocardial infarction at 70. His older brother died at 59 due to lung cancer while his 72-year-old sister is alive and well with no significant medical history.   Physical examination reveals left calf mildly tender to palpation with a notable difference in calf circumference between the two legs. He also has mild pitting edema in the left leg. His vitals were stable except for a mildly elevated blood pressure of 148/93.  Doppler ultrasound showed a non-compressible segment in the left popliteal vein  indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was subsequently started on anticoagulation with enoxaparin in the hospital and was transitioned to apixaban for long-term management.  The patient's DVT  on the grounds of his sedentary lifestyle and hypertension  classifies him as having provoked DVT. Finding out the cause of the patient's unexplained weight loss and weakness might be critical  as it could suggest an underlying malignancy which is a risk factor for DVT. Management with anticoagulants has been started  and further investigations for underlying causes are ongoing.  The patient has been educated about the importance of regular movement  maintaining a healthy lifestyle  and the need for medical compliance. He has been scheduled for a follow-up in two weeks for the therapy evaluation and further assessment.

Key Complaints: The patient presents with a chief complaint of experiencing progressively worsening and persistent left lower limb pain and swelling for the past week. She reports that the swelling and pain is generalized throughout her left lower leg  enhanced after prolonged sitting at work  and not relieved by rest or over-the-counter pain medications. She denies any recent trauma to the area  chest pain  or difficulty in breathing. However  she mentions feeling intermittently dizzy over the past few days.   This case presentation should raise the clinical suspicion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Given the patient's age  sedentary lifestyle  obesity  smoking history  and hypertension  she is at a higher risk for venous thromboembolism. Primary attention should be given to her limb symptoms  while her intermittent dizziness may also point towards possible concurrent pulmonary embolism.

8,10,13,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial13,"Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Information: Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 65 Sex: Male Occupation: Retired Accountant Race: Caucasian Lifestyle: Sedentary Location: Urban  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 10 years ago  for which he is currently taking antihypertensives and statins respectively. He is a former smoker  having quit 15 years ago after smoking a pack a day for 30 years. He is overweight with a BMI of 28 and has a family history of cardiovascular diseases.  Key Complaints: Mr. Doe visited his general practitioner complaining of a non-traumatic  increasingly painful and swollen right lower leg over the past 5 days. He recently had a long overseas flight about a week ago and had been sedentary for most of the time since then. Upon further questioning  he reported a mild discomfort in his chest  but described it as """"not quite like heartburn """" and a slight shortness of breath when climbing stairs.  Objective Clinical Information: Physical examination revealed a noticeably swollen and reddened right calf. There were no signs of injury or inflammation around the area. The circumference of the right calf was greater than that of the left. On auscultation  breath sounds were clear bilaterally  heart sounds regular  no murmur. Palpation was painful on the right calf. No distinct mass or bulge felt. The rest of the systemic examination was within normal limits. The patient's blood pressure was slightly elevated  and his pulse was regular.  Possible Diagnosis: Considering his recent prolonged travel  sedentary behaviour  and clinical presentation  Mr. Doe is at high risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with a potential pulmonary embolism (PE). However  other differential diagnoses that may need to be ruled out could include Baker’s cyst  cellulitis  or muscle strain.  Plan: Order duplex ultrasonography test to confirm DVT and D-dimer blood test. Based on Mr. Doe's complaints of slight dyspnea and chest discomfort  an immediate chest CT angiography would be essential to rule out PE. Consultation with a hematologist for anticoagulation management will be the course of action upon confirmation of DVT. Suggesting lifestyle modifications and assessing his need for weight management and exercise regimen will be part of long-term management.   This case highlights the importance of proactively looking at risk factors for DVT  understanding the complications  and recognizing the need for immediate action when PE is suspected. It also emphasizes the importance of education about prevention of DVT  especially in high-risk situations like long-haul travel.   This case is designed to guide medical students through the comprehensive management of a potential DVT case  including diagnosis  immediate clinical management  and long-term preventive strategies."

8,10,23,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial23,Case Report:  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Roberts is a 65-year-old Caucasian male  a retired construction worker  who hails from West Virginia. He was a smoker for 40 years and quit two years ago.  Past Medical History: Mr. Roberts has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the past ten years  managed with lisinopril and rosuvastatin. He has no history of diabetes  stroke or heart disease. His body mass index (BMI) is 27. He has a surgical history of right hip replacement done four years ago due to severe osteoarthritis. He is allergic to penicillin  which causes him to break out in hives.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Roberts presents to the outpatient clinic complaining of undue pain  swelling  and slight redness in his right leg. The pain started approximately a week ago  gradually escalating in severity  and it is now difficult for him to walk. He mentions that the leg feels warm and appears swollen. He also mentions he's felt slightly short of breath recently  but he has no associated chest pain  palpitations  fainting  recent illnesses or injuries. He denies ever having experienced similar symptoms in the past. He also denies having traveled long distances or being immobile for extended periods recently. Mr. Roberts appears anxious about his symptoms but maintains coherence and cooperativeness.   Plan: Given Mr. Roberts’ symptoms and past medical history  it is crucial to consider deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the differential diagnosis. Urgent diagnostic tests such as a Doppler ultrasound of his right leg and  if necessary  D-dimer levels are planned. He would need a referral to a hematologist for further investigation and management. It's also necessary to emphasize the risks associated with DVT including pulmonary embolism. Low molecular weight heparin may be considered for initial treatment once the diagnosis is confirmed. The importance of seeking immediate medical help should worsening symptoms occur like acute chest pain or difficulty in breathing will be emphasized.
8,10,24,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial24,Patient Case Study: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics:  Age: 68 years  Sex: Male  Ethnicity: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired professor (used to lead a sedentary lifestyle)  Past Medical History: 1.

He denies any chest pain  shortness of breath  palpitations  abdominal pain  recent trauma  or any other symptom. 5. He mentions that his general practitioner recently asked him to switch to a sedentary lifestyle due to his age and existing medical conditions. 6. The patient has no known allergies.  This brief case report showcases a typical high-risk patient for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  presenting with typical symptoms. Medical students should investigate the possibility of DVT with such presentations and align the patient's history  especially features like hypertension  diabetes  obesity  hip replacement surgery  sedentary lifestyle  atrial fibrillation  etc.  which are risk factors for DVT.
8,10,26,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial26,Patient Information:   The patient is a 65-year-old obese Caucasian male named Mr. Brown.  Past Medical History:   Mr. Brown has a medical history of hypertension  type II diabetes  hyperlipidemia for which he is on medications. He used to smoke for around 40 years  but he quit ten years ago. He did not have any history of surgeries or hospital admissions until now.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Brown came to the emergency department complaining of sudden swelling and pain in his right lower limb  specifically around the calf muscle  that started a day ago without any preceding injury or trauma. He also reported a slight fever  fatigue  and some shortness of breath. On further questioning  he mentioned that he had recently taken a 12-hour long-haul flight after attending his daughter's wedding  during which he remained seated most of the time. Since his return 5 days ago  he had been taking rest and had minimal physical activity. He denied any chest pain  dizziness  or loss of consciousness.   Remarks:   Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) should be suspected in Mr.Brown  considering his clinical symptoms of unilateral leg swelling  pain  warmth  and redness over the calf muscle. Other risk factors that make his case more suspicious for DVT include advanced age  obesity  long-term immobility due to the recent long-haul flight  hypertension  and history of smoking. As he has similar symptoms for Pulmonary Embolism  such as shortness of breath and fatigue  he should be appropriately evaluated and managed accordingly. For diagnosis  D-dimer tests  ultrasound of the leg  CT scan  or MRI might be conducted. If diagnosed  anticoagulants would likely be a part of the initial treatment strategy. Since Mr. Brown would be at an increased risk for DVT recurrence  long-term maintenance therapy may be needed.

Chief Complaint:  Mr. Jonathan presented to the emergency department with a swollen  warm  reddened left calf  which he noticed since 2 days. He mentioned the swelling is usually milder in the morning but worsens as the day progresses  accompanied by a dull  consistent pain in his lower leg. He denies any recent trauma or injuries to the leg. He also complained of shortness of breath which he attributed to his age and overweight status  but noted that it has become more pronounced recently  especially on lying down. He has had no chest pain but a feeling of mild discomfort around his lower chest region.  Other Complaints/ Symptoms:  On further questioning  he admitted that he has been feeling fatigued and weak over the last week or so  but thought it was due to his recovery from surgery. He denies any fever  chills  cough  haemoptysis or night sweats. There has been no alteration in his bowel or urinary habits.  Please ensure to use this as a base to develop further diagnostic steps and treatment options. It would be crucial to demonstrate the process of diagnosing a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) using Doppler ultrasound and D-dimer tests and then a detailed approach to managing it  discussing both pharmacological (anticoagulants) and non-pharmacological measures (compression stockings  lifestyle modification). Also take the discussion towards the complications of DVT such as pulmonary embolism  which the patient might be developing  given the increased shortness of breath.  Remember  a key learning from this case should be the understanding of Virchow's Triad – stasis of blood flow  endothelial injury and a hypercoagulable state – all three factors of which are present in this case.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  diagnosed 5 years ago  currently managed with Metformin 1000 mg twice daily. 4. Ex-smoker  quit 15 years ago (1 pack/day for 30 years).  Presenting Complaint:  The patient reports a 4-day history of increasing left lower leg pain and swelling. He describes the pain as a heavy  dull ache that gets worse when standing or walking  but improves slightly with leg elevation. He also reports instances of slight unexplained breathlessness over the same period.  Additional findings:  No recent history of immobility  trauma  or surgery. He flew cross-country (6-hour flight) for a family visit 1 week ago. He denies chest pain  dizziness  or other symptoms.  Possible Case Discussion Points:   This case presents a good opportunity to discuss the risk factors  clinical presentation  diagnosis  and management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Specifically  it would be valuable to dive into how the patient’s past medical history (hypertension  high cholesterol  Type 2 diabetes  and smoking history) and recent long-haul flight increase his risk for DVT. Furthermore  the symptoms reported by the patient align with those typically seen in DVT  especially the progressive leg pain and swelling  and unexplained shortness of breath  which might indicate a pulmonary embolism as a complication. This case allows medical students to understand the application of the Wells Score and the use of D-dimer testing and duplex ultrasonography in the diagnostic pathway. The importance of prophylactic measures in patients at risk of DVT could be another point of discussion.

Specifically  he complained of significant discomfort while walking and noticed increased warmth around the affected region. He has no history of recent trauma or injury to the region.  As observed  Mr. Reyes's case is typical for deep vein thrombosis. Still  medical students should focus on differentiating it from other conditions that may present similarly  such as a Baker's cyst  cellulitis  superficial thrombophlebitis  or muscle strain. Also  his previous medical history and risk factors should be used to explain the pathophysiology of DVT to students.
8,10,49,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial49,Patient Information:  Mr. Aiden  a 65-year-old Caucasian retired welder from Wisconsin  presented himself in the emergency department.  Primary Complaint: Patient complains of sudden onset swelling  warmth  and pain on the left side below the knee that has been progressively worsening over three days. He also complains of mild shortness of breath.  Medical History: Mr. Aiden has been a smoker for approximately 30 years and he quit five years ago. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension fifteen years ago  which has been managed with Metformin and Lisinopril respectively. Also  he underwent radical prostatectomy due to prostate cancer three years ago. His mother died of a stroke and his father had a stent placed due to heart disease.  Lifestyle: He enjoys reading and gardening and is not involved in regular physical exercise. Limited travel history with the recent trip being a cross-country car ride four months ago. He admits to moderate alcohol intake.  Review of Systems: Upon enquiry  he reported no chest pain  dizziness  nausea  or vomiting. Reports no history of similar episodes in the past.  Physical Examination: Physical examination revealed a mildly distressed individual. Vital signs: BP 138/85  Pulse rate 90  Temp 98.2F  SpO2 97% on room air. His left lower leg was swollen  warmer compared to the right  and tender along with the line of veins  indicative of superficial venous inflammation. No palpable cords were observed.  Provisional Assessment: Given the patient’s history of hypercoagulable state (prostatic cancer  diabetes  and hypertension)  prolonged sedentary status  and current symptomatology  a possibility of Deep Vein Thrombosis is considered. Differential diagnosis should rule out cellulitis  muscular strain  and Baker’s cyst.  The next steps would be Diagnostic Testing (D-Dimer assay  Doppler ultrasound) and management based on results. 
8,10,50,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial50,Case Report:  Patient Information: A 67-year-old Caucasian male named Mr. Smith reports to the clinic with complaints of significant leg swelling and unrelenting pain in his right leg that has progressively worsened over the past two weeks.  Past Medical History: Mr. Smith has a history of hypertension  varicose veins and had undergone hip replacement surgery two months ago. He is a retired truck driver  a non-smoker and has a moderate alcohol intake. Patient's father had a history of stroke in his late seventies. He is currently on antihypertensive medications and low-dose aspirin.  Chief Complaints: The patient primarily complains about increasing leg pain on the right side and noticeable swelling. He also mentions a feeling of warmth in the swollen area and somewhat limited mobility  likely due to discomfort and pain. He has also noticed light red or blue skin discoloration on the swollen leg.  Objective: The primary objective of this case is to sensitize the medical students to the process of suspecting  diagnosing  and managing a case of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  particularly in patients who have undergone recent surgery  have a sedentary lifestyle or present with comorbidities that heighten their risk.  Rationale: The patient's history of recent hip surgery  physical inactivity due to his previous job  and symptoms of leg swelling  pain  warmth and discoloration  in combination with a history of varicose veins  position him as a potential candidate for DVT. As such  his case provides an excellent resource for students to learn about the risk factors  clinical suspicion  diagnostic approach  and management of DVT. It is crucial for students to understand the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis in preventing fatal complications such as pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. At the same time  this case can also educate them about the preventive measures and lifestyle changes required for DVT patients.

He also mentioned discomfort in his right leg and occasional chest pain over the last two weeks. His daughter was concerned about the unusual swelling and slight color change in his right leg. She also pointed out that he does most of his activities sitting in his armchair and rarely moves around since his hip replacement surgery.  Note to students: This case was selected as it provides an excellent basis for the discussion of risk factors  signs  and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. It is crucial to understand the combination of clinical findings  patient history  and appropriate investigations  in this case  to manage this condition effectively and prevent serious complications like pulmonary embolism.
8,10,52,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial52,Patient Information:  Mrs. Abigail Thompson  68-year-old  Caucasian  retired school teacher Address: 275 Fairhaven Avenue  Worcester  MA 01604  Presenting Symptoms: Mrs. Thompson presents with progressive swelling and pain in her right lower limb over the last two days. She also mentions an increasing fatigue and slight breathlessness.  Past Medical History: Mrs. Thompson has a history of long-standing hypertension which is under control with hydrochlorothiazide. She is also diagnosed with type II diabetes and is currently under metformin treatment. In terms of surgeries  she had a total knee replacement surgery (right knee) for severe osteoarthritis about 3 weeks ago. Family history reveals her father suffered a stroke in his early 70s.  Physical Examination: Vital signs: Blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg  pulse rate 92 beats per minute  respiration rate 18 breaths per minute  and body temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F). The oxygen saturation is 97%.   On inspection  her right lower leg appears swollen  with visible distention of the veins. On palpation  there is tenderness in the calf muscle  and it feels warm to touch. There is a positive Homan's sign. Her respirations are clear and rhythmical. Both cardiovascular and abdominal examinations are unremarkable.  Further Investigation: Given her recent surgery and the clinical presentation  the suspicion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is high. An ultrasound Doppler of the lower limb is suggested for further confirmation.   Educational objectives with this case: - Recognize the signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. - Understand the risk factors contributing to the development of DVT  including recent surgeries  especially orthopedic procedures  like total knee replacements. - Highlighting the relevance of inherited or acquired blood clotting disorders in such presentations. - Practice making a differential diagnosis with other conditions that might present similarly  like cellulitis or Baker's cyst. - Decide an appropriate course of action  including diagnostics and treatment options for suspected DVT cases.
8,10,53,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial53,"Patient Case: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Demographics: Name: Joseph Clark  Age: 64 years  Gender: Male  Race: White  Occupation: Retired construction engineer Insurance Status: Medicare  Past Medical History: - Hypertension (10 years)  controlled with medication - Obesity (BMI: 32) - History of smoking (quit 5 years ago) - No known allergies - Previous right leg fracture (age 42) - No history of surgeries or blood disorders - Father died of a stroke at age 70 - Mother had varicose veins and passed away at 82 due to pneumonia  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Clark arrived at the emergency department with complaints of the sudden onset of swelling in his left lower leg. He reports a feeling of """"deep-seated"""" pain that has escalated over the past 3 days. The pain appears to be localized  does not radiate  and intensifies upon standing or walking. He has noticed that the skin over the calf is warmer compared to the other leg.   He also complained of increased shortness of breath and a dry cough that started 1 day ago. He denies chest pain  fever  or other systemic symptoms. He hasn't traveled long distances recently  and his activity level is generally low.  Additionally  he reports no injuries to the leg  no recent surgeries  and no history of similar symptoms. The patient takes a daily antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril) and has no known drug allergies. He has not been using any over-the-counter or herbal medications.   This case of sudden unilateral lower limb swelling and aching pain  combined with the patient's age  past medical history  and low activity level  warrants a thorough examination  keeping in mind the possible diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The new onset of shortness of breath and cough could be signs of a potential complication of DVT - a pulmonary embolism. It is therefore essential to approach this case with careful evaluation and timely management.  As a next step  a thorough physical examination  appropriate laboratory tests  and imaging like a Doppler Ultrasound for his leg/pelvis and possibly a CT of the chest should be ordered. If his symptoms are due to DVT and/or pulmonary embolism  treatment should commence immediately  with education given to the patient on the potential risks and preventative measures for future instances."

8,10,57,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial57,Case Report - Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. John Doe Age: 65 years  Sex: Male Occupation: Retired accountant  lifestyle mainly sedentary Residence: Rural  lives alone Ethnicity: Caucasian  Past Medical History: - Hypertension  under control with Amlodipine 10 mg daily for the past ten years. - Type 2 diabetes mellitus  managed with diet control and Metformin. - Smoking history: 30 pack-years  quit five years ago. - No known drug allergies. - No family history of clotting disorders. - Underwent right total hip arthroplasty two years ago.  Presenting Complaints: Mr. Doe presented to the outpatient department with a complaint of unilateral swelling in the left leg  which he noticed gradually increasing over a week. The leg has become red and mildly tender  but he denies any injuries or bug bites. He also reports mild pain which increases during walking and a feeling of warmth over the swelling region. No associated symptoms of chest pain  shortness of breath  dizziness  recent trauma  or prolonged bed rest.  This is a concise but comprehensive case about a patient with DVT. The discussed medical history and symptoms like swelling  redness  and pain can guide medical students to suspect deep vein thrombosis  which can further be confirmed by investigations. They should also be made aware that patients like Mr. Doe with risk factors such as a Sedentary lifestyle  past major surgery  older age  obesity  and high-risk ailments like hypertension and diabetes are more susceptible to develop DVT. Additionally  absence of symptoms like shortness of breath or chest pain yet  may exclude pulmonary embolism  a dangerous complication of DVT. Students should though remember that sometimes DVT may be asymptomatic.

He is a non-smoker with a moderate alcohol intake. He is overweight with a BMI of 28.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Doe has controlled hypertension  diagnosed at age 60  for which he is on Amlodipine 5mg once daily. Additionally  he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus five years ago  currently managed on Metformin 750mg twice daily. He underwent a total knee replacement of his left knee 7 days ago following a fall at home where he fractured his patella. He is currently on prophylactic low molecular weight Heparin which started post-operatively.  Key Complaints: Mr. Doe complains that for the past 24 hours  he has an increasing pain and swelling in his right lower calf  which is the non-operated limb. He states that the leg has turned 'slightly red' and that it feels 'warm to touch'. He denied chest pain  shortness of breath  or hemoptysis. He has no history of DVT in the past and no familial clotting disorders that he is aware of.  Upon physical examination  there is tenderness on deep palpation of the right calf  with noticeable unilateral swelling of the calf and an increase in its circumference in comparison to the left calf. The right lower limb is observed to be slightly warmer with a faint red discoloration. Signs of superficial vein distension are apparent.   Clinical Suspicion:  Given the patient’s recent surgery  which was a significant risk factor  as well as his symptoms  there is a high suspicion for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right lower limb. 
8,10,59,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial59,Case Report:  Title: An interesting Case of Deep Vein Thrombosis in an otherwise Healthy Male  Patient Demographics:  Mr. Smith  a Caucasian male  aged 54  married with one child  employed as an accountant  non-smoker  and consumes alcohol only on social occasions. He has no known allergies or genetic history of significant diseases.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smith is relatively healthy with no history of any major illnesses. His immunizations are up-to-date  and he doesn't consume any chronic medications. He reports engaging in moderate exercise 3 times per week  and his BMI is within the normal range. He did  however  mention that he recently returned from a long-haul flight (12 hours) and experienced minor leg discomfort towards the end of the flight  which he attributed to the lack of movement.  Key Complaints: Mr. Smith has presented at the clinic complaining of a localized 'hot  red patch' on his left lower leg accompanied by intermittent sharp pains  without any recent trauma or injury. Upon inquiry  he reported experiencing a general feeling of fatigue and malaise over the past two days and had been taking over-the-counter pain-relief medication to manage the leg pain. He denied any cough  chest pain  or difficulty breathing. Mr. Smith expressed concern as the leg symptoms persisted despite rest and medication.  The plan will be to carry out a comprehensive physical examination followed by appropriate diagnostic tests  bearing in mind the possibility of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). This case can be used to teach students the importance of considering risk factors (such as prolonged immobilization during the recent long-haul flight) and identifying key symptoms for the prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of DVT.
8,10,60,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial60,Case Report:   Patient Identification: Mr. John Smithson Age: 67 Gender: Male  Race: Caucasian  Occupation: Retired  Living Situation: Lives with wife  Past Medical History:  Mr. Smithson is a moderately obese individual with a past medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed 10 years ago) and Hypertension (for the past 7 years). He is a non-smoker but used to smoke a pack a day until 6 years ago when he quit smoking due to health concerns. His father had a history of Myocardial Infarction at an early age of 50. Mr. Smithson has been on medications for his medical conditions and is compliant about them.   Key Complaints:  Patient came to the ER with reports of increasing discomfort  redness  warmth and swelling in his left calf for the past 24 hours. The pain appears to worsen when he stands or walks  and slightly alleviates once he lays down. He recalls a long 12-hour car ride last week due to a family emergency  where he mostly remained seated. Besides this  he also mentions occasional dyspnea on exertion over the last few days  but no chest pain or discomfort. His wife reports him looking a bit more pale than usual.   All these indicators point towards a possible case of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). The next steps will involve conducting a detailed history  doing a complete physical examination  and proposing different investigations based on the info. The objective will be to confirm if it is indeed DVT  identify its extent  and evaluate the risk of potential Pulmonary Embolism.
8,10,61,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial61,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics:   Mr. Thompson is a 65-year-old Caucasian male. He previously worked as a truck driver  involving prolonged periods of immobility  but has been retired for the past five years. He is a current smoker with a 45 pack-year history. His body mass index indicates mild obesity (BMI of 31). He has no allergies and lives alone.  Past Medical History:  Mr. Thompson has a history of hypertension  controlled with medication  and had undergone a right knee replacement surgery approximately six weeks prior to presentation. He has a family history of cardiovascular disease: his father passed away from myocardial infarction at 68 and his older brother suffered a stroke.  Key Complaints:  Mr. Thompson presents to the clinic with a 48-hour history of increasing pain and swelling in his right calf. He denies any recent trauma  fever  chest pain  or difficulty breathing. Initial assessment shows the right calf is visibly swollen  warm and tender on palpation  but with good distal pulses.  Further questions indicate that he has been less mobile than usual due to his knee surgery  but he hasn't been diligent with the prophylactic anticoagulation regime prescribed post-operation. He also reports occasionally forgetting to take his blood pressure medication.  Initial examination and vague symptoms might suggest a musculoskeletal etiology  such as a strained muscle from post-operative exercises. However  given his recent orthopedic surgery  prolonged immobility  history of smoking  and family history of cardiovascular disease  there is a high clinical suspicion of Deep Vein Thrombosis.   The case proceeds from here to further investigations  discussion of the Wells Criteria and potential implications of neglecting postoperative prophylactic care.

She is a non-smoker but has a history of moderate alcohol consumption until she stopped drinking about 10 years ago.  Past Medical History:   Ms. Rodriguez has a known history of Hypertension on antihypertensive medication (Amlodipine 5mg daily) and Type II Diabetes Mellitus on oral hypoglycemic agents (Metformin 500mg twice daily). She was diagnosed with these conditions about 15 years ago but has managed to control them fairly well with medications and lifestyle modifications. She does not have any known allergies. She has a surgical history of hysterectomy 20 years ago due to fibroids. Her family history is significant for a sister who had suffered from Pulmonary Embolism.  Presenting Complaints:   Ms. Rodriguez presents with complaints of a dull ache in her left calf  which she first noticed 48 hours ago. She states that the pain seems to increase with walking and eases slightly when she elevates the leg. She denies any recent trauma  fever  chest pain  or shortness of breath. On questioning further  she admits that her mobility has been decreased for the past week due to a common cold  and she tended to stay in bed most of the time.   Physical Examination:  On examination  her left calf is tender to touch  warm and slightly swollen compared to the right. Her vitals are stable  but her left calf circumference is 3 cm greater than her right. Pulses are palpable bilaterally.  Upon examination findings and her recent immobility  there is a high index of suspicion for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). An urgent Doppler Ultrasound of the left lower limb will be advised for confirmation of DVT  and appropriate therapeutic measures will be started based upon the results. The patient will be educated about the condition  symptoms of possible complications like Pulmonary Embolism  and methods to prevent recurrence such as leg exercises  losing weight  and avoiding long periods of immobility.
8,10,64,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial64,Case Report:  Patient Information:  A 72-year-old African-American male veteran is brought to the emergency room by his middle-aged daughter. The patient lives in a retirement home and is retired from active military duty. He has a history of smoking  though he quit 10 years ago.  Medical History:  The patient has a history of hypertension  type II diabetes mellitus (DM)  and hyperlipidemia. All conditions are being managed with medications including hydrochlorothiazide  metformin  and atorvastatin respectively. He underwent a right total hip replacement surgery two weeks ago due to osteoarthritis  and after a week's stay in the hospital  was discharged in a stable condition. On day 10 after the surgery  the patient sought help for a urinary tract infection (UTI)  for which he was given a course of antibiotics.  Presenting Complaint:  The patient's daughter reports that he has been complaining of increasing pain and swelling in his right calf over the last two days despite keeping his leg elevated. She also reports that he seems more fatigued than usual and has experienced shortness of breath earlier today.  Possible Diagnosis:  Based on the patient's presenting signs and symptoms  recent hip surgery  and his risk factors (including his age  history of prolonged immobilization following surgery  and history of hypertension and DM)  there is a high level of suspicion for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  This case study is a potential opportunity for medical students to understand the clinical presentation  risk factors  and possible complications of DVT. Discussing this case can provide insight into how various medical histories are interlinked and may contribute to new problems due to immobility  infections or other complications. It prompts for timely intervention and treatment to prevent potentially severe sequelae  including pulmonary embolism.

History of sedentary lifestyle; travels extensively  Presenting Complaints:  The patient presents with a two-day history of increasing pain and swelling in the left lower leg. The pain is dull and constant  non-radiating  worsening with standing or walking. He also complained of moderate redness along with the area. He denies any history of recent trauma or injury to the leg. He also reports feeling a bit short of breath when climbing stairs  which was unusual for him.  Physical examination revealed warmth  tenderness  and mild erythema over the left calf on palpation. The left calf circumference was found to be larger than his right calf. There was no palpable cord. His vitals were stable  but his oxygen saturation dropped to 94% on exertion.  These findings were suggestive of deep vein thrombosis. The additional shortness of breath indicated the possibility of a pulmonary embolism. A D-dimer test was ordered  which came back with elevated levels. Subsequently  a duplex ultrasound revealed a noncompressible segment in the left posterior tibial and the peroneal vein confirming  the suspected DVT.   A CT pulmonary angiogram was done to rule out a PE due to the patient's shortness of breath  which fortunately did not show any emboli in the lungs. A referral was made to the hematology team for further management and anticoagulant therapy was initiated.  This case is designed to train medical students to recognize the signs and symptoms of DVT  understand its risk factors  and learn to manage this condition. It highlights the importance of being suspicious about the possibility of DVT in patients presenting with unilateral leg pain and swelling  especially in the context of recent surgery  immobilization  or personal history of thrombotic events. It also underscores the clinical implications and risk of Pulmonary Embolism in patients with DVT  emphasizing the need for urgent medical management.

8,10,71,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial71,Case Report:  Patient Demographics: Sarah Thompson is a 68-year-old Caucasian woman who resides in a suburban assisted living facility. She is a retired school teacher  a non-smoker  and does not drink alcohol. She has 2 adult children and 5 grandchildren that she loves spending time with but has problems in movement due to her condition.   Past Medical History: Sarah has a known history of hypertension and a 5-year history of treated breast cancer. She has been on Tamoxifen therapy for the past 3 years. She also had a cholecystectomy in her late 50s and suffers from occasional irritable bowel syndrome. She is also overweight (BMI: 30) which she has struggled with for many years. Her family history includes a mother who died at 79 YO from myocardial infarction and father at 71 YO from stroke.  Key Complaints: Sarah came to the clinic with complaints of swelling in her left lower leg  which has been present for about 4 days.  She initially assumed the swelling was due to her inactivity  as she spends most of her days sitting alone reading books. However  she started noticing progressive enlargement of the left lower leg along with a mild  dull ache. The leg is also notably warm to touch. The skin has also turned a slight shade of red. She denies any shortness of breath  chest pain  lightheadedness  or syncope.  The pain is non-radiating and gets worse while standing and walking. She reports she has no fever  recent trauma  surgery or history of such swelling before. This condition has kept her from visiting her grandchildren  which added to her concern.      This case could be designed to focus on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and could emphasize the need to examine the high-risk factors such as old age  obesity  sedentary lifestyle  long term use of Tamoxifen (which is known to increase the risk of clot formation) and the presentation of unilateral limb pain  swelling and erythema. The case can also address the differential diagnosis ruling out congestive heart failure  lymphedema  and cellulitis. The medical students can be encouraged to discuss the underlying pathophysiology  clinical manifestation  and potential complications like pulmonary embolism.

8,10,76,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial76,Patient Profile  Patient Details: Mrs. Savita Singh  a 63-year-old female   Occupation: Retired school teacher  Ethnicity: Indian  Location: Lives in New Delhi  India  Medical History: Mrs. Singh has a history of type II diabetes mellitus  controlled with Metformin. She is a former smoker  having quit 20 years ago. She has a history of obesity and has undergone a hysterectomy about 10 years ago due to fibroids. She is diligent with her medications and medical appointments.  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Singh visited her local clinic with complaints of noticeable swelling  pain  and warmth in the calf muscle of her right leg which she had first observed three days ago. Additionally  she reported progressive difficulty in walking due to the discomfort. She also noted an episode of breathlessness and light-headedness  which she dismissed as an aftermath of her walk.  Relevant Information: She acknowledged prolonged periods of inactivity during her recent trip that involved long-haul flights. On further evaluation  it was ascertained that she had not been using her prescribed pressure stockings during the flight. She took 325 mg of Aspirin as prophylaxis pre-flight  a habit she had developed through her years of travel.  This scenario is designed to simulate dealing with a case of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - a condition where a blood clot is formed in the deep veins  commonly in the leg. The students should be instructed to assess Mrs. Singh’s risk factors  her symptoms and to make a plan for diagnostic testing and management. The case should highlight the importance of considering DVT in the differential diagnosis in any patient with unilateral leg swelling. It will also help emphasize the significance of prompt identification and management of DVT to prevent potential life-threatening complications like pulmonary embolisms.

8,10,81,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial81,Case Report  Patient Demographics: The patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian female named Ms. Smith. She is a retired school teacher and lives alone in her single-story home.  Past Medical History: The patient has a known history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus which are well-controlled with medication. Ms. Smith is also a former smoker  having quit 12 years ago. She reports a family history of cardiovascular disease  with both her father and a brother experiencing myocardial infarctions in their 60s. She has no known allergies and is currently taking hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension and metformin for diabetes.  Key Complaints: Ms. Smith presented to the emergency department with a complaint of swelling in her left lower leg  which she first noticed the day prior. By morning  the swelling had increased and was associated with a dull aching discomfort. She also reports a mild general feeling of malaise  but denies any headache  chest pain  dyspnea  or abdominal discomfort.   Upon further questioning  Ms. Smith revealed that she recently came back from a transatlantic flight a week ago and was immobile for most of the flight due to some mild travel anxiety. Over the past week  she also noticed progressive fatigue  but did not seek immediate medical attention considering it to be due to jet lag. She has not sustained any injuries  does not remember being bitten by any insects  and reports no recent illnesses or surgeries.  Note: This case is designed to help students consider the possibility of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  given this patient's risk factors such as advanced age  immobility  and long-distance travel as well as her symptoms of unilateral leg swelling and discomfort. The non-specific symptom of fatigue may also be a consequence of DVT and it is important for students to recognize the broad presentations of this condition.

8,10,84,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial84,Case Report  Subject: Mrs. Rita L.  a 70-year-old Caucasian woman  Presenting Complaints: Mrs. Rita L. comes to the emergency department with complaints of newly persistent pain and swelling in her left lower limb for the past 3-5 days. She describes a throbbing type of pain that is worse when she is standing for a long period. Additionally  she mentions noticing a slightly warmer feeling in this area compared to her other leg and slight changes in skin color (light redness or discoloration).  Patient Demographics: The patient is a retired librarian  a widow with two grown-up children living independently. She lives alone and is a non-smoker. She denies any recent injuries  trauma  or surgery to the legs.  Past Medical History: Mrs. L has had a long-standing history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension  which are well-controlled with oral medications. She has a BMI of 31 and falls under the category of obesity. She also has a history of varicose veins for which she has been using compression stockings.  She reports no known allergies or any previous episodes or family history of venous thromboembolism. She has never been prescribed or used oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy.  This Training Case Objective: Medical students should consider her symptoms and past history  especially her sedentary lifestyle  obesity  varicosis  and age which are risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). They should be able to suggest appropriate investigations (such as a D-dimer test or ultrasound)  understand the importance of this condition due to its life-threatening complication - pulmonary embolism  and propose potential treatment options including anticoagulants  thrombolytics and preventative measures. 
8,10,85,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial85,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis  Patient Demographics: Name: Mr. James Robinson Sex: Male Age: 67 years old Occupation: Retired banker Ethnic background: Caucasian  Residence: Urbanna  Virginia Smoker: No Drinker: Occasional  Past Medical History: Mr. Robinson is a known case of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus which have been under control with medication for over 10 years. No known drugs allergies. No previous surgical history. He has had a sedentary lifestyle and follows a high-fat diet. His family history is significant for a paternal uncle who died due to pulmonary embolism.   Key Complaints: Mr. Robinson presented with swelling and aching in his left lower limb (calf region) for last 5 days. The pain was described as a dull ache  exacerbated on walking and relieved by rest. There is no history of any acute trauma or injury to the leg  no fever. He also mentioned recent airline travel from California four days ago  during which he was seated for most of the 5-hour flight.   The symptoms are indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  which can manifest as unilateral leg pain and swelling. The patient's disposition towards a sedentary lifestyle  long uninterrupted travel (known as an economy-class syndrome)  and family history of vascular diseases signify a potential higher risk for developing DVT. His hypertension and diabetes can also contribute as secondary risk factors.   Upon examination  the doctor should note any erythema  signs of calf tenderness  palpable veins  or differences in the circumferences of the two calves. These details will be a critical part of the clinical evaluation. A D-dimer test should be done to screen for a thrombus  but its absence cannot definitively rule out DVT.   An ultrasound scan is expected to follow to confirm the diagnosis of DVT. Treatment would then follow with anticoagulation therapy.   The students should understand the potential severity of DVT  risk factors  symptoms  and possible complications  including the deadly pulmonary embolism. Furthermore  the case highlights the critical value of the patient's clinical history in evaluating DVT and other cardiovascular conditions.

Past medical history:  Mr. Smith has a known history of type II diabetes and hypertension  both managed on medications for the past 8 years. He had a myocardial infarction 9 years ago and underwent angioplasty. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and COPD  with mild intermittent asthma.   Key complaints:  Patient has been having a persisting  dull ache and discomfort in his right calf for the past week. He reports the pain worsening at the end of the day and seems to subside with rest. The patient reports no trauma to the area and no penetrating foreign bodies. He does not report any knee pain  stiffness  or swelling in any of the joints. He denies fever  chest pain.  The pain and discomfort has prompted the patient to limit his physical activities. He has noted some minor ankle edema in the evening  that relieved by morning. Loss of appetite  but no significant weight loss. He also felt shortness of breath at day 5 when he tried to do some physical tasks but blamed it on his smoking history.   Unrelated to this  he reports an unrelated incidence of sudden discomfort with brief visual abnormalities experienced 2 days prior  but felt resolved within a few minutes  and did not seek medical attention considering it a random event.  Today  he's reporting increased calf pain  swollen ankle and unusual warmth over the calf area. He has also noted a mild  infrequent cough for a day. These new symptoms finally prompted him to seek medical help. With his array of symptoms  deep vein thrombosis is high on the differential.   Social History: The patient was a heavy cigarette smoker  a pack a day starting age 17 and stopped at 53. He drinks alcohol socially and denies illicit drug use. He enjoys a moderate activity level that includes daily walking for approximately half an hour. The patient has never been on long-duration flights  hospitalized  or immobilized for extended periods in the past recent years. He has no known drug allergies.  With his history and presenting symptoms  deep vein thrombosis (DVT) should be highly considered  and students should also consider the differential diagnoses and discuss potential investigations  treatment  and management. Future focus should also be inclined toward the prevention of potentially dangerous complications like pulmonary embolism (PE).

Past Medical History: Mr. Thomas has a medical history of hypertension  which is well handled with medication  mild hypercholesterolemia  and type-2 diabetes under control with oral medications. He had a surgical history of a total right hip replacement performed five years ago. He has a known history of smoking  consuming a half pack of cigarettes per day for 35 years  but he quit a decade ago.  Presenting Complaint: Over the past week  Mr. Thomas has been experiencing moderate unrelenting pain in his left calf aggravated by walking  a slight swelling  and increased warmth in the area. He denies any trauma to his lower limbs  any shortness of breath  chest pain  or dizziness. Mr. Thomas states that he had been quite active at his home over the last week and did not travel recently. He has no known allergies.  Key Screenings: Considering Mr. Thomas's symptoms  his past medical history  and the potential risk factors for DVT such as age  history of orthopedic surgery  and hypomobility  the students should promptly evaluate him for the likelihood of deep vein thrombosis. Initial evaluation should include an assessment of vitals  a thorough lower extremity examination  and organized consideration for DVT using a validated clinical decision rule such as the Wells Score for DVT.  Key Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the risk factors  and recognize the signs and symptoms of DVT. 2. To appreciate the importance of an organized approach to the assessment of DVT. 3. To interpret the result of a DVT risk assessment tool such as the Wells Score. 4. To understand the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment of DVT to prevent thromboembolic complications such as a pulmonary embolism.

Family History: - Father passed away from myocardial infarction at age: 68 - Mother with Alzheimer's disease - No known genetic disorders/conditions in the family  Presenting Complaint: Mr. Rodriguez presented to the clinic with a 5-day history of increasing pain  warmth  and swelling in his right calf. He reports that he recently returned from a 10-hour flight about a week ago and noticed leg discomfort started a couple of days after that. He denied fever  chest pain  cough  shortness of breath  or hemoptysis. He also denied history of similar symptoms in the past.  Clinical Examination: - Positive Homans' sign in right leg - Unilateral calf swelling measuring approximately 3cm larger in diameter than the left calf - Warmth and erythema over the right calf - Vital Signs: Blood Pressure – 160/90 mmHg  Pulse – 80 bpm regularly  Temperature – 98.2 F  Respiratory rate - 18 breaths per minute - Neurological exam within normal limits.  Given the patient's recent travel history  clinical symptoms  and physical findings  Mr. Rodriguez's case should raise immediate suspicion for deep vein thrombosis. This scenario serves to teach medical students not only about the diagnosis and management of deep vein thrombosis  but also the importance of considering patient's risk factors  like prolonged immobilization (long flight) in a patient with underlying hypercoagulable state (Hypertension  Hyperlipidemia) and its potential complications.
8,10,91,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial91,"Patient Information:   A 62-year-old Caucasian male  6"""" tall  weighing 220 lbs. He has a history of chronic cigarette smoking (30 years  1 pack per day)  uncontrolled hypertension  and sedentary lifestyle.   Past Medical History:  The patient was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 10 years ago. He has also been diagnosed and treated for hypertension over the last 5 years. Both his mother and paternal uncle had deep vein thrombosis.

The calf was tender on deep palpation. There were no visible varicose veins and no signs of superficial vein thrombosis. His cardiovascular and respiratory examination within normal limits. Lab values awaited.  In Mr. Smith's case  a sedentary lifestyle and a history of hypertension are risk factors for DVT. The primary complaints of unilateral leg swelling  pain  and recent onset of shortness of breath warrant a high index of suspicion for DVT. The next step would be to perform a D-Dimer test and  if positive  followed by Duplex ultrasonography or Venography to confirm diagnosis.  This case aims to highlight the importance of considering DVT in patients presenting with the common complaints of sudden onset leg pain and swelling  especially in the context of the patient's lifestyle and any relevant medical history. It also emphasizes getting appropriate diagnostic testing when clinically suspicious for DVT.

8,10,99,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial99,Patient Information: Mrs. Joan Black  a 68-year-old Caucasian female  residing in downtown Seattle.  Past Medical History: Reported hypertension and type II diabetes  both condition are controlled with metformin and Lisinopril  respectively. Mrs. Black is a non-smoker and exercises occasionally. She mentioned discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) about a decade ago due to risk of complications. She recently underwent a total right hip replacement surgery and was discharged a couple of weeks ago after routine follow-up.  Key Complaints: Mrs. Black visited the outpatient clinic with primary complaints of increasing discomfort  tenderness  and warmth in her right lower leg. She also noticed a slight swelling in the region. She refuses any recent injury  fall  or trauma to her leg. Her pain is moderately severe  non-radiating  and steady  and it worsens on standing. Despite her attempts to deal with it using over-the-counter analgesics  there is no relief. She also mentioned experiencing modest shortness of breath recently  which she had attributed to lack of physical activity due to her leg pain.  Objective Findings: Vital signs demonstrated a slightly raised heart rate. Examination of right lower limb revealed edema  erythema  and mild tenderness along the distribution of the calf muscles. Higher than normal warmth was noted in the affected area. A slight increase in the diameter of the involved leg was noted in comparison to the other leg.   This initial patient case can be used to guide medical students towards a preliminary diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The case provides cues like age  a recent hip replacement surgery (prolonged immobility)  HRT in past  and key complaints consistent with DVT such as swelling  warmth  pain  redness in the right lower leg  along with symptoms of possible lung involvement. It's a framework for teaching the importance of immediate assessment and intervention for critical conditions like DVT  which if left untreated  may lead to pulmonary embolism.
8,10,100,diagnosis8-prompt10-trial100,Case Report: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  Patient Information: Mr. John Doe  a 65-year-old Caucasian male  retired teacher  non-smoker  moderate alcohol drinker  presents to the emergency room.  Past Medical History: Mr. Doe has a history of Type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension  both controlled with medication (metformin 500mg BID and amlodipine 5mg QD). He also mentioned that he had recently been on a 12-hour long-haul flight 7 days ago where he had minimal mobility. He has a family history of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) as his mother had a DVT at the age of 75 and his older brother had a pulmonary embolism 5 years ago.  Chief Complaints: Mr. Doe complained of a 5-day history of increasing calf pain and swelling in his right leg. He noticed the leg swelling the evening after coming from his trip  initially attributed it to jet lag and exhaustion. He reported no chest pain  hematoptysis  or shortness of breath. There was no prior history of similar symptoms and he denied any recent injury to the leg. The pain is sharper when standing and walking but it eases when he lifts up his leg. He claims that the affected leg looks redder and feels warmer than the other one.  On physical examination  his right calf was found to be larger in circumference than the left  with an increased temperature  and slight erythema. Palpable cord was noticed  and Homan's sign was positive. Other examination results were within normal range  with no chest abnormalities indicative of a Pulmonary Embolism.    Mr. Doe's D-dimer test was positive  elevating the suspicion of a DVT. Doppler ultrasonography confirmed the presence of non-compressible segment in right popliteal vein  consistent with a diagnosis of DVT.  Treatment and Follow-up: Given the patient's age  prior health conditions  recent travel history  symptoms  and diagnosis  the students should consider how to manage Mr. Doe's case in terms of immediate management  secondary prevention with long-term anticoagulant therapy  potential complications  and patient education regarding lifestyle modification  signs of potential complications  and medication compliance. Further potential scenarios could involve discussions on outpatient treatment feasibility  selection of anticoagulant therapy  and the approach to thrombophilia testing.
